History
1980s
Burning Man began as a bonfire ritual on the summer solstice. Sculptor Mary Grauberger, a friend of Larry Harvey's girlfriend, Janet Lohr, held solstice bonfire gatherings on Baker Beach for several years before 1986, some of which Harvey attended. When Grauberger stopped organizing it, Harvey ""picked up the torch"", with Grauberger's permission, and ran with it. He and Jerry James built the first wooden effigy on June 21, 1986, cobbled together using scrap wood, to be torched that evening. On June 22, Harvey, James, and a few friends met on Baker Beach in San Francisco and burned an 8-foot-tall (2.4 m) wooden man and a smaller wooden dog. Harvey later described his inspiration for burning these effigies as a spontaneous act of ""radical self-expression"". In 1987, the Man grew to 15 feet (5 m) tall, and by 1988, it had grown to 30 feet (9 m).
By 1988, Harvey formally named the summer solstice ritual ""Burning Man"" by titling flyers for the happening as such. This was done to ward off references to ""wicker man"", the reputed Celtic pagan practice of burning live sacrifices in human-shaped wicker cages. Harvey has said that he had not seen the 1973 cult film The Wicker Man until many years after and that it did not inspire the action.

1990 to 1996
In 1990, a separate event was planned by Kevin Evans and John Law on the remote and largely unknown playa, known as the Black Rock Desert, about 110 miles (180 km) north of Reno, Nevada. Evans conceived it as a dadaist temporary autonomous zone with sculptures to be burned and situationist performance art. He asked John Law, who also had experience on the dry lake and was a defining founder of the Cacophony Society, to take on central organizing functions of the events. In the Cacophony Society's newsletter, it was announced as Zone Trip No. 4, A Bad Day at Black Rock (inspired by the 1955 film of the same name).
Meanwhile, the solstice burn at Baker Beach was interrupted by the park police for not having a permit. After striking a deal to raise the Man but not to burn it, event organizers disassembled it and returned it to the vacant lot where it had been built. Shortly thereafter, the legs and torso of the Man were chain-sawed, and the pieces were removed when the space was unexpectedly leased as a parking lot. The Man was reconstructed, led by Dan Miller, Harvey's then-housemate of many years, just in time to take it to Zone Trip No. 4.
Michael Mikel, another active Cacophonist, realized that participants unfamiliar with the environment of the dry lake would benefit from knowledgeable persons helping to ensure they did not get lost in the deep dry lake and risk dehydration and death. He took the name Danger Ranger and created the Black Rock Rangers to assist them. Thus, Black Rock City began as a fellowship organized by Law and Mikel, based on Evans's and Grauberger's ideas and Harvey's and James's symbolic man. Drawing on experience in the sign business and with light sculpture, Law prepared custom neon tubes for the Man starting in 1991 so it could be seen as a beacon to aid navigation at night long before there were any planned roads.
In its early years, the community grew by word of mouth alone, and all were considered (and generally not invited until they could be expected to be) participants in their contribution to the cacophonous situationist vibe. There were no paid or scheduled performers or artists, no separation between art and life nor art space and living space, no rules other than ""Don't interfere with anyone else's immediate experience"" and ""no guns in central camp"".
1991 marked the first year that the event had a legal permit through the BLM (the Bureau of Land Management). It was also the year that art model and fire dancer (and later Burning Man's first art director) Crimson Rose attended the event. 1992 saw the birth of a smaller, intensive, nearby event named ""Desert Siteworks"", conceived and directed by William Binzen and co-produced (in 1993 and '94) with Judy West. There were about 20 participants the first year, and approximately 100 in the second and third year. The annual, several weeks-long event, was held over summer Solstice at various fertile hot springs surrounding the desert. Participants built art and participated in self-directed performances.
Some key organizers of Burning Man were also part of Desert Siteworks (Law, Mikel) and Binzen was a friend of Harvey. Hence, the two events saw much cross-pollination of ideas and participants. The Desert Siteworks project ran for three years (1992–1994). 1996 was the first year a formal partnership was created to own the name ""Burning Man"" and was also the last year the event was held in the middle of the Black Rock Desert with no fence around it.
Before the event opened to the public in 1996, a worker named Michael Furey was killed in a motorcycle crash while riding from Gerlach, Nevada, to the Burning Man camp in the Black Rock Desert. Harvey insisted that the death had not occurred at Burning Man, since the gates were not yet open. Another couple were run over in their tent by an art car driving to the ""rave camp"", which was at that time distant from the main camp. After the 1996 event, Law broke with Burning Man and publicly said the event should not continue.

1997 to 2013
1997 marked another major pivotal year for the event. It had to be moved because the permit for Black Rock was denied for the 1997 event. A team conducting land speed trials had a conflicting permit that took precedence. Fly Ranch, with the smaller adjoining Hualapai dry lakebed, just west of the Black Rock desert, was chosen as the alternate location. This moved Burning Man from Pershing County/federal BLM land into the jurisdiction of Washoe County, which brought a protracted list of permit requirements.
In 1999 to comply with the new requirements and manage the increased liability load, Harvey and five organizers formed Black Rock City LLC with the assistance of ""Biz Babe"" Dana Harrison. The LLC founders consisted of Larry Harvey (chief philosophy officer), Harley K. DuBois (chief transition officer), Marian Goodell (CEO), Crimson Rose (art transition officer), Will Roger Peterson (Nevada relations director), and Michael Mikel (historian and archivist).
Will Roger Peterson and Flynn Mauthe created the Black Rock City Department of Public Works (DPW) to build the ""city"" grid layout (a requirement so that emergency vehicles could be directed to an ""address""), designed by Rod Garrett, an architect. Garrett continued as the city designer until his death in 2011, at age 76. He is also credited with the design of all of the Man bases from 2001 through 2012, the center camp café and first camp. 1998 saw a return to the Black Rock desert, although not to the deep playa, along with a temporary perimeter fence. The event has remained there since.
As the population of Black Rock City grew, the BLM added more restrictions, and changes were made in how people were invited to the event, notably the addition of publicized online ticket sales to all comers; further rules were established concerning its survival. Some critics of the later phase of the event cite these rules as impinging on the original freedoms and principles, diminishing the scope of the experience unacceptably, while many newer attendees find the increased level of activity more than balances out the changes:

A grid street structure.
A speed limit of 5 mph (8 km/h).
A ban on driving, except for approved ""mutant vehicles"" and service vehicles.
Safety standards on mutant vehicles.
Burning of any art must be done on an approved burn platform.
A ban on fireworks.
A ban on animals.
Another notable restriction to attendees is the 9.2-mile- (14.8 km) long temporary plastic fence that surrounds the event and defines the pentagon of land used by the event on the southern edge of the Black Rock dry lake. This 4-foot- (1.2-meter) high barrier is known as the ""trash fence"" because its initial use was to catch wind-blown debris that might escape from campsites during the event. Since 2002, the area beyond this fence has not been accessible to Burning Man participants during the event.
One visitor who was accidentally burned at the 2005 event unsuccessfully sued Black Rock City LLC in San Francisco County Superior Court. On June 30, 2009, the California Court of Appeal for the First District upheld the trial court's grant of summary judgment to Black Rock City LLC on the basis that people who deliberately walk toward The Man after it is ignited assume the risk of getting burned by such a hazardous object.

2013 to 2019
In December 2013, following negotiations between founders, Black Rock City LLC was made a subsidiary of a new nonprofit entity known as the Burning Man Project.
On September 3, 2017, a 41-year-old man, Aaron Joel Mitchell, fought his way past a safety cordon of volunteers and firefighters and threw himself into the flames of the Man. Mitchell died the next day due to cardiac arrest, bodily shock, and third-degree burns to 97% of his body. His death was ruled a suicide.

2020 to 2021
On April 10, 2020, the Burning Man Project announced that Burning Man was canceled for 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, making 2020 the first year Burning Man did not happen since its inception. They then decided to offer ticket refunds despite the tickets being sold explicitly as non-refundable.
On September 7, 2020, an estimated 1,000 Burners celebrated on San Francisco's Ocean Beach. San Francisco Mayor London Breed tweeted about the event, ""This was reckless and selfish. You aren't celebrating, but are putting people's lives and our progress at risk. No one is immune from spreading the virus."" Several thousand also showed up in the Black Rock desert for an unofficial event and some described it as a return to the ""old days"".
The 2021 event was canceled on April 27, 2021, due to the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite progress on vaccination, organizers said that ""uncertainties that need to be resolved are impossible to resolve in the time we have"". On May 14, 2021, the Burning Man Project released tickets on their website for online events slated between August 22 and September 7, 2021.
The unofficial event was more extensive than in 2020, with an estimated 20,000 attending. Various groups loosely coordinated it, including Black Rock Plan B and Rogue Burn. The Bureau of Land Management implemented restrictions including no structures other than shade structures and no fires other than campfires. There was a massive illuminated drone display outlining the Man instead of the burning of a Man effigy.

2023
The 2023 Burning Man had rains and subsequent flooding on Labor Day weekend, with a lockdown preventing vehicle movement throughout the site. Organizers arranged for some cellular service and shared a 2023 Wet Playa Survival Guide: ""no driving is permitted until the playa surface dries up, with the exception of emergency services… Participants are encouraged to conserve food, water, and fuel, and shelter in a warm, safe space"" and told attendees about Burning Man Information Radio (BMIR) 94.5 FM and Gate Information Radio Station (GARS) 95.1. One person died following the flooding, with thousands more stranded.

2024
On August 25, 2024, the first day of the 2024 Burning Man festival, a female participant died. On August 26, it was reported that tickets remained unsold for the festival for the first time since 2011.
An epic dust storm was reported on the final day of the event, snarling departure traffic and causing lines to last more than four hours.
The Burning Man Project is currently engaged in a fundraising campaign that began in October 2024. The campaign aims to collect $20 million. On December 19, 2024, CEO Marian Goodell emailed supporters that the project still requires $14 million to meet its financial goal for the 2025 festival.

Event timeline
The statistics below illustrate the growth in both the scale and scope of Burning Man in terms of location, height of the central Man sculpture, population, ticket price, and several registered camps and art.
After starting at 8 ft (2.4 m) and growing taller each of the next three years, the height of the titular Man remained at 40 ft (12 m) between 1989 and 2013. During those years, changes in the size and form of the base on which the wooden Man stood accounted for the differing heights of the overall structures. In 2014 the construction of the Man changed to a 105 ft (32 m) tall figure standing directly on the ground with no base. From 2015 to 2019 the Man returned to 40 ft (12 m) in height.

Population counts
The population count is a stipulation of the Special Recreation Permit (SRP) granted to the Burning Man Project, formerly Black Rock City, LLC (BRC), by the BLM, for the event each year. Originally used to calculate fees, it's now used to ensure that the event does not exceed the maximum authorized population as specified in the SRP. Not everyone at the event is included in the population count. Exempted from the count are government personnel and government contractors; however, this has changed over time.
The population count was originally used to calculate fees owed to the BLM. It was not long until the BLM began considering putting a limit on the number of people that would be allowed to attend the event. This became a point of contention as early as 1998 when the BLM proposed a complicated usage formula, effectively limiting the size of the event to that of the previous year.
Starting in 2006, the SRP stipulated that BRC manage ""ticket sales in a manner to keep the maximum population of the event from increasing more than 6% above the highest population recorded in a previous year."": 1  Fees were based on the daily population counts of Black Rock City at noon.: 12  This was the first year where fees were explicitly exempted for BRC staff.: 12 .
In 2011, the fee structure changed to be based on adjusted gross income and was no longer tied to daily population counts.: 5 
The 2012 SRP further defined who was to be counted in population counts. The term ""participant"" was introduced, as defined in that year's Environmental Assessment (EA), to include ""all attendees of the event, including paid participants and volunteers. The population does not include government personnel, Humboldt General Hospital emergency service providers, vendors and contractors."": 2–1  The maximum authorized population now applied to ""participants"".: 1 
In 2014, volunteers were explicitly exempted from the population count and the population cap was further refined to now apply to ""paid participants"".: 1 
In 2019, the definition of ""population"" changed again, this time to include BRC staff and volunteers, now collectively referred to as ""attendees"".: 1  This coincided with the necessity of a new Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the 2019–2028 SRP application which introduced this change in definition.: ES-1 
The Burning Man Project reported a population of 78,850 for that year, an increase of about 8,600 people from the previous year, noting that ""everyone"" was now being counted in the maximum population count. This roughly correlates with the Burning Man Project's 2019 Form 990 disclosure which states it employs 986 people and has 10,000 volunteers.: 1 
In 2022, an additional restriction on the total number of attendees for the entirety of the event was introduced. ""The cumulative maximum authorized population for the 2022 event is 87,000 total attendees."" The maximum number of attendees on the playa at any one time remained as it was in 2019 at 80,000.: 1

Principles
Because of the variety of goals fostered by participatory attendees, known as ""Burners,"" Burning Man does not have a single focus. Features of the event are subject to the participants and include community, artwork, absurdity, decommodification and revelry. Participation is encouraged.
The Burning Man event and its affiliated communities are guided by 10 principles meant to evoke the cultural ethos that has emerged from the event. They were originally written by Larry Harvey in 2004 as guidelines for regional organizing, then later became universal criteria of the general culture of the multifaceted movement. The 10 Principles are:

radical inclusion
gifting
decommodification
radical self-reliance
radical self-expression
communal effort
civic responsibility
leaving no trace
participation
immediacy
The descriptions in quotes are the actual text:

Radical inclusion
""Anyone may be a part of Burning Man. We welcome and respect the stranger. No prerequisites exist for participation in our community."" This was written with a broad stroke for general organizing, meaning anyone is welcome to the Burning Man culture. Prerequisites for the Burning Man event are: participants are expected to provide for their own basic needs, follow the guidelines in the annually updated event ""survival guide"", and purchase a $475 ticket to get in.

Gifting
""Burning Man is devoted to acts of gift-giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value."" Instead of cash, burners are encouraged to rely on a gift economy, a sort of potlatch. In the earliest days of the event, an underground barter economy also existed, in which burners exchanged ""favors"" with each other. While this was originally supported by the Burning Man organization, it is now largely discouraged. Instead, burners are encouraged to give one another gifts unconditionally.

Decommodification
""To preserve the spirit of gifting, our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. We stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation. We resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience."" No cash transactions are permitted between burners. Cash can be used for a select few charity, fuel, and sanitation vendors as follows:

Café beverages such as coffee, chai, lemonade, etc., which are sold at Center Camp Café, operated by the organizers of the event. Citing cost, decreased need, environmental impact, and decommodification, beverage sales were halted in 2022.
Ice sales benefit the local Gerlach-Empire school system.
Tickets for the shuttle bus to the nearest Nevada communities of Gerlach and Empire which is operated by a contractor not participating in the event: Green Tortoise.
A reentry wristband, which allows a person to leave and reenter the event and may be purchased at the gate upon exit.
An airport use fee, payable at the airport upon first entry.
Diesel and biodiesel sold by third-party contractors.
RV dump service and camp graywater disposal service.
Private portable toilets and servicing, which can be arranged with the official contractor.

Radical self-reliance
""Burning Man encourages the individual to discover, exercise, and rely on his or her inner resources."" The event's harsh environment and remote location require participants to be responsible for their subsistence. Since the LLC forbids most commerce, participants must be prepared and bring all their own supplies with the exception of the items stated in Decommodification. Public portable toilets are also available throughout the city; some of these are, like art cars, decorated in imaginative ways by volunteers.

Radical self-expression
""Radical self-expression arises from the unique gifts of the individual. No one other than the individual or a collaborating group can determine its content. It is offered as a gift to others. In this spirit, the giver should respect the rights and liberties of the recipient."" Burners are encouraged to express themselves in a number of ways through various art forms and projects. The event is clothing-optional and public nudity is common, though not practiced by the majority.

Communal effort
""Our community values creative cooperation and collaboration. We strive to produce, promote and protect social networks, public spaces, works of art, and methods of communication that support such interaction."" Burners are encouraged to work with and help one another.

Civic responsibility
""We value civil society. Community members who organize events should assume responsibility for public welfare and endeavor to communicate civic responsibilities to participants. They must also assume responsibility for conducting events in accordance with local, state and federal laws.""

Leave no trace
""Our community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a better state than when we found them.""

Participation
""Our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play. We make the world real through actions that open the heart."" People are encouraged to participate, rather than observe.

Immediacy
""Immediate experience is, in many ways, the most important touchstone of value in our culture. We seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves, the reality of those around us, participation in society, and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers. No idea can substitute for this experience.""

The Temple
The Temple is the secondary major recurring art installation at Burning Man after the Man, and is considered just as important to the event culture. According to the Burning Man Project, ""The Temple is a community shared space that is an important part of Black Rock City. It is not a temple in recognition of any religion; it's a neutral, non-denominational spiritual space where everyone can gather to share in the experience of remembering the past, honoring or cursing the present, and pondering the future to come.""
The prime function of the Temple is to be a canvas upon which people can leave words and objects behind to be burned, and to serve as ""a place of contemplation, a place to rest, a place of reflection, a place of rituals, weddings, reunions, etc"". During the event, 400 volunteer Temple Guardians monitor the Temple 24 hours a day. The Temple is burned on the eighth and final night of the festival, following the ""Man burn"" on the previous night.

Art
A hallmark of Burning Man is large-scale interactive installation art inspired by the intersection of maker culture, technology, and nature. Many works invite participation through climbing, touch, technological interfaces, or motion. At night much of the artwork is illuminated by fire or LEDs. Creative expression through art is encouraged at Burning Man in many forms. Music, performance art, and guerrilla theatre are art forms commonly presented within the camps and developed areas of the city. Artwork is placed in the open playa beyond the streets of the city. Each year hundreds of works of art, ranging from small to very large-scale, are brought to Black Rock City.
Art on the playa is assisted by a department of the Burning Man Project called the Artery, which helps artists place their art in the desert and ensures lighting to prevent collisions, burn platform to protect the integrity of the dry lake bed and that fire safety requirements are met. Art grants are available to participants via a system of curation and oversight, with application deadlines early in the year. Grants are intended to help artists produce work beyond the scope of their own means, and are generally intended to cover only a portion of the costs associated with creation of the pieces, usually requiring considerable reliance on an artist's community resources. Aggregate funding for all grants varies depending on the number and quality of the submissions (usually well over 100) but amounts to several percent (in the order of $500,000 in recent years) of the gross receipts from ticket sales. In 2006, 29 pieces were funded.
Various standards regarding the nature of the artworks eligible for grants are set by the Art Department, but compliance with the theme and interactivity are important considerations. This funding has fostered artistic communities, most notably in the Bay Area of California, the region that has historically provided a majority of the event's participants. There are active and successful outreach efforts to enlarge the regional scope of the event and the grant program.

No Spectators: The Art of Burning Man
In 2018, the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., brought art from Burning Man to the nation's capital. The exhibition took over the entire Renwick Gallery building and surrounding neighborhood. The exhibit featured room-sized installations, costumes, and jewelry, while photographs and archival materials from the Nevada Museum of Art trace Burning Man's growth and its bohemian roots.
Large-scale installations form the core of the exhibition. Individual artists and collectives featured in the exhibit include David Best, Candy Chang, Marco Cochrane, Duane Flatmo, Michael Garlington and Natalia Bertotti, Five Ton Crane Arts Collective, FoldHaus Art Collective, Scott Froschauer, HYBYCOZO, (Yelena Filipchuk and Serge Beaulieu), Android Jones, Aaron Taylor Kuffner, Christopher Schardt, Richard Wilks, and Leo Villareal.
In addition, multiple large-scale public Burning Man art installations were exhibited throughout the neighborhood surrounding the museum, for an extension of the show No Spectators: Beyond the Renwick, which included works by Jack Champion, Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson, HYBYCOZO, Laura Kimpton, Kate Raudenbush, and Mischell Riley. All outdoor works had been installed as honorarium artwork at Burning Man in years past, except for the artwork by Hybycozo. This outdoor exhibition was co-produced by a first ever collaboration with the Golden Triangle BID (Business Improvement District in Washington DC), curated by Karyn Miller.

Mutant vehicles
Mutant Vehicles are purpose-built or creatively altered motorized vehicles. The term ""Mutant Vehicle"" was coined by organizers of the Burning Man event to delineate a type of ""Art Car"" that was more dramatically modified than simply decorating an existing vehicle.
Burning Man participants who wish to bring motorized mutant vehicles must submit their designs in advance to the event's own DMV or ""Department of Mutant Vehicles"" for consideration. If a vehicle design meets the ""Mutant Vehicle Criteria,"" the vehicle is invited to the event for a final physical inspection and licensing at the event. Not all designs and proposals are accepted.
The event organizers, and the DMV, have set the bar high for what it deems an acceptable MV each year, in effect capping the number of Mutant Vehicles. This is in response to constraints imposed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which grants permits to hold the event on federal property, and to participants who want to maintain a pedestrian-friendly environment. Vehicles that are minimally altered, and/or whose primary function is to transport participants, are discouraged and not invited.
One of the criteria the DMV employs to determine whether an application for a proposed Mutant Vehicle is approved is ""can you recognize the base vehicle"". For example, if a 1967 VW van covered with glitter, dolls' heads, and old cooking utensils can still be recognized as a VW van, the DMV would consider it an ""Art Car,"" but it would not be sufficiently altered to meet the Mutant Vehicle Criteria.
There were over six hundred approved Mutant Vehicles at the event in 2010.

Bicycles
Bicycles and tricycles are popular for getting around on the dry lake. Mountain bikes are generally preferred over road bikes for riding on the dried silt, which is normally hard but becomes loose with traffic. Participants often decorate their bikes to make them unique. Since lighting on the bikes is critically important for safety at night, many participants incorporate the lighting into their decorations, using electroluminescent wire (a thin, flexible tube that glows with a neon-like effect when energized with electricity, also known as el wire) to create intricate patterns over the frame of the bike. Every night during Burning Man, thousands of people on their bikes and art cars, illuminated sculptures and stages create a unique visual effect.

Theme camps
Electronic music
Camps focusing on electronic music, often played by live DJs, began to appear in 1992, an influence of the rave culture of the San Francisco area. Terbo Ted was identified as the first ever DJ in Burning Man history, opening with a Jean Michel Jarre song played off a vinyl record. DJs typically occupied an area on the outskirts of the Playa nicknamed the ""Techno Ghetto"". In later years, certain spokes of the main camp were designated for ""sound camps"", with limits on volume and speaker positioning, angled away from the center of Black Rock City.
To work around the rules, mutant vehicles with live DJs and large sound systems began to appear as well. A number of major electronic music camps have been well-known returnees at Burning Man, including Opulent Temple and Robot Heart. Major producers and DJs representing various eras and genres have performed at Burning Man, however DJ events or ""lineups"" are discouraged from being publicized in the spirit of decommodification and immediacy.
In recent years, concerns began to surface among attendees that a growing number of ""mainstream"" electronic dance music acts had begun to appear. In 2015, organizers established a new area known as the ""Deep Playa Music Zone"" (or DMZ), to serve as a new host for art cars featuring live DJs.

Black Rock City
Black Rock City, often abbreviated to BRC, is the temporary city created by Burning Man participants. Much of the layout and general city infrastructure is constructed by Department of Public Works (DPW) volunteers who often reside in Black Rock City for several weeks before and after the event. The remainder of the city including theme camps, villages, art installations and individual camping are all created by participants.

City planning
The developed part of the city is arranged as a series of concentric streets in an arc composing, since 1999, two-thirds of a 1.5-mile (2.4-km) diameter circle with the Man at the center. Radial streets, sometimes called Avenues, extend from the Man to the outermost circle. The outlines of these streets are visible on aerial photographs. The ""missing"" third of the circle, along with the open interior, is used for art installations.

The innermost street is named the Esplanade. The remaining streets are given names to coincide with the overall theme of the burn, and ordered in ways such as alphabetical order or stem to stern, to make them easier to recall. For example, in 1999, for the ""Wheel of Time"" theme, and again in 2004 for ""The Vault of Heaven"" theme, the streets were named after the planets of the solar system. The radial streets are usually given a clock designation, for example, 6:00 or 6:15, in which the Man is at the center of the clock face. 12:00 is in the middle of the third of the arc lacking streets, usually at a bearing of 60° true from the Man.
These avenues have been identified in other ways, notably in 2002, in accordance with ""The Floating World"" theme, as the degrees of a compass. For example 175 degrees, and in 2003 as part of the Beyond Belief theme as adjectives (""Rational, Absurd"") that caused every intersection with a concentric street, named after concepts of belief such as ""Authority, Creed"", to form a phrase such as ""Absurd Authority"" or ""Rational Creed."" These proved unpopular with participants due to difficulty in navigating the city without the familiar clock layout.
The Black Rock City Airport is constructed adjacent to the city, typically on its southern side (see below: § Transportation).

Center Camp
Center Camp is along the midline of Black Rock City, facing the Man at the 6:00 position on the Esplanade. This area serves as a central meeting place for the city and contains the Center Camp Cafe, and a number of other city operations such as camps supporting public radio (BMIR 94.5 FM), Earth Guardians, Recycling Camp, Ranger Outposts, BLM and ESD (Emergency Response), and Arctica (ice).

Villages and theme camps
Villages and theme camps are along the innermost streets of Black Rock City, often offering entertainment or gifts to participants.
Theme camps are a collective of anywhere between several, to several hundred participants, representing theirselves under a unique value offering. To qualify as a ""theme camp"", and therefore be granted placement in BRC, you must apply through official Burning Man placement channels, and remain in good standing to be placed for future years.
Furthermore, ""Villages"" exist in Black Rock City and are collections of theme camps which share common values, and coordinate resources between their ""village"" of individual theme camps.
Theme camps and villages, as well as ""open campers"" who are free to camp outside of Placement boundaries, form to create an atmosphere in Black Rock City that they have collectively envisioned. As Burning Man grows it attracts an ever more diverse crowd. Subcultures form around theme camps at Black Rock City similar to what can be found in other cities.

Volunteers
The Burning Man event is heavily dependent on a large number of volunteers.

Safety, policing and regulations
Black Rock City is patrolled by various local and state law enforcement agencies as well as the Bureau of Land Management Rangers. The local police issue $1,500 fines for drug use and serving alcohol to minors. Burning Man also has its own in-house group of volunteers, the Black Rock Rangers, who act as informal mediators when disputes arise.
Firefighting, emergency medical services (EMS), mental health, and communications support is provided by the volunteer Black Rock City Emergency Services Department (ESD). Three ""MASH""-like stations are set up in the city: station 3, 6, and 9. Station 6 is staffed by physicians and nurses working with a contracted state licensed ALS Medical provider. Stations 3 and 9 are staffed by Black Rock City ESD personnel. While Station 3 and 9 provide emergency services and basic life support, the volunteers are generally doctors, nurses, EMTs/paramedics, and firefighters. Both station 3 and 9 have a small fire engine available in addition to a Hazardous material/Rescue truck and quick response vehicle for medical emergencies.
In documents from February 2013 first made public in August 2015, it was revealed that in August 2010, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had sent a memo to its field offices in Nevada stating that it would patrol Burning Man to ""aid in the prevention of terrorist activities and intelligence collection"". Although a threat assessment performed by the FBI determined that drug usage and crowd control were the only major threats to Burning Man, the Bureau still sent an unspecified number of undercover agents to the event, with ""no adverse threats or reactions"".

Black Rock City design evolution
1986–1991
From the very beginning on Baker Beach, to 1991 when Burning Man was set into its desert home, there was no real organizational structure to the city. According to Rod Garrett, designer of Black Rock City, ""The original form of the camp was a circle. This was not particularly planned, but formed instinctively from the traditional campfire circle and the urge to 'circle the wagons' against the nearly boundless space."" This didn't work much longer, as attendance was reaching into the hundreds, and such a large gathering required some planning.

1992–1995
The Bureau of Land Management took notice of the event, and required that plans be drawn up to maintain safety. They required the Burn to be registered as an official event. In response, four cardinal roads were added emanating from center camp. The Man was located 100 yd (91 m) west of Center camp, due to the camp being oriented with the path of the sun across the sky, as opposed to north-to-south. The center circle from the birth of the event was maintained.
In 1993, the first sound camp was opened. It was known as the Techno Ghetto, and it was located two miles north of Center Camp. It was not a usual theme camp, but was instead a mini hub on its own. There was a small ""center camp"" with a message board and Port-a-potties. The center was surrounded by a circle of camping area 1,200 ft (370 m) across. Six massive sound systems faced out from the circle. The Techno Ghetto was placed separately to keep the 'rave' out of the main event. As time has progressed, music has become more and more closely tied into the core culture of Burning Man, even spawning a unique genre known as Playa Tech.

1996
With the population growing to 8,000 in 1996, more structure was essential to both appease the Bureau of Land Management and to maintain safety. A ring around Center Camp, named Ring Road, was added to provide for a second circle of theme camps. The eastern section of the circle around Center Camp, in a cone shape, was declared a ""No Man's Land"", devoid of all art installations and campsites. The goal was to provide a picturesque view from Center Camp of the Man in the distance. In addition to the camps circling the center, there were camps lining the outside of the No Man's Land cone.
The techno ghetto had its last year in 1996. Regardless, the spark of music had ignited, and other sound camps followed.

1997
In 1997 Burning Man was relocated off of the Playa to the Hualapai Flat, due to political problems with Washoe County. Black Rock City truly became a city in 1997, with formal, labeled streets, zoning, and registration for vehicles and theme camps. Rod Garret was brought on board as the lead designer of Black Rock City from then on. In his design, Center Camp remained the starting point, with two angular arms reaching out on either side to form a shallow ""V"" shape around the Man. These main arms consisted of six annular roads, and two outlying plazas. 1997 was the first year of a Ranger-patrolled perimeter, and the first year of one entry gate.

1998
Burning Man returned to the playa in 1998, and the basis of the modern layout was implemented. The idea was to ""recreate some of the intimacy of our original camping circle, but on a much larger civic scale"". Rod Garret's design smoothed out the angular ""V"" from 1997 and implemented the arc. In 1998, it stretched less than half-way around the circle. The radial streets were numbered North 1–20 and South 1–20, instead of the modern clock face system of names such as 11:30 or 5:15. There were four large plazas, each occupied by a major theme camp.

1999–2010
In 1999, for the Wheel of Time theme, the great arc of the city was expanded to the full 240° (2⁄3 of a circle) that it is today. The streets were renumbered to correspond to a clock face. The Man was in the center, Center Camp at 6:00, and streets every 30 minutes (15°) 2:00 through 10:00.
2000 saw the introduction of the Temple as a fixture on the playa, and it has grown to be easily as important as the Man. It was placed at 12:00 out in the deep playa in the open third of the circle. 2000 introduced the concept of a loud side. A quiet side was replaced by the rule that large scale sound camps would be placed at the 10:00 and 2:00 edges, facing out into the deep playa.
Extra annular streets have been added, as need has increased.

2011–present
In 2011, extra radial streets were added, from G street out, to make outer-city navigation easier. These streets were added at intervals of fifteen minutes.

Transportation
Road access
Highway 34 provides access to the main entrance to Black Rock City. The highway connects to Highway 447 north of Gerlach, which then runs south to Highway 427 in Wadsworth near Interstate 80.
Vehicles then proceed from the Highway 34 entrance north to the main gate via Gate Road, a desert dirt road with a speed limit of 10 mph. All vehicles driving into the city must have the appropriate vehicle pass. All occupants are required to have valid tickets in order to get in. Vehicles are searched for any items that are prohibited in the city. For those who have their tickets held at Will Call, the booths are located between the Highway 34 entrance and the main gate.
All tickets and vehicle passes must be bought in advance. They are not directly sold outside the gate or at the Will Call booths. Unless they have a valid early arrival pass for the pre-event set up, any vehicle who arrives before the gate opens is turned away and told to go back to Reno, and not to wait along the side of the road on either Highways 34 or 447, which would be a safety hazard, nor stay in Gerlach, and overcrowd the small town.
When the Burning Man ends, and the mass exodus from Black Rock City begins, a road traffic control procedure called ""Pulsing"" is used to direct vehicles out of the city. At regular intervals, usually an hour during the peak periods, all vehicles are ""pulsed"" forward all at once for about a mile along Gate Road. This allows vehicles to stop and turn off their engines, while those at the southernmost mile of the multi-lane Gate Road slowly merge and then turn onto the two-lane Highway 34.

Commercial airports
The airport with regular commercial service closest to the event is the Reno–Tahoe International Airport in Reno, Nevada, over two hours' drive away. In 2018 an estimated 18,000 burners arrived and departed through Reno's airport for the event, giving the airport an $11 million boost. Inside the airport that year, a Burning Man-specific information table was created and placed near the baggage claim area.
San Francisco International Airport, nearly six hours away by car, is the nearest airport with a high volume of international service. Other prominent airports, albeit with less international passenger traffic and more domestic services, are Sacramento International Airport, a 4.5-hour drive from Black Rock City, as well as other Bay Area airports such as Oakland International Airport and San Jose International Airport.
Salt Lake City International Airport, serving Salt Lake City, Utah, and Harry Reid International Airport, serving Las Vegas, Nevada, are both an 8.5-hour drive to Black Rock City.

Temporary airport
A section of the Playa is used for a temporary airport, which is set up before each event and completely erased afterward. It serves both general aviation and charter flights. Pilots began camping there about 1995. Once compelled to add structure, in 1999, it was established in a form acceptable to the BLM through the efforts of Tiger Tiger (Lissa Shoun) and LLC board member Mr. Klean (Will Roger). In 2009, it was recognized by the FAA as a private airport and designated 88NV. It is found on the Klamath Falls Sectional, using a CTAF of 122.9 MHz.
Black Rock UNICOM and the airport are operational on that frequency from 6:00 am to 7:30 pm PDT each day during the event. The runway is simply a compacted strip of playa, and is not lighted. Because of the unique air traffic and safety issues associated with the airport, pilots are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with published information and procedures provided by, for example, AOPA. Because of the changes in the surface of the playa each year, information about the airport is subject to change.

Shuttles
There are prepaid shuttles originating in Reno and San Francisco that move participants to and from the event. During the event there was also a paid shuttle between the event and the nearby towns of Gerlach and Empire, but this has been discontinued. Exiting and reentering the event requires an additional fee, and is highly discouraged.

Other
Participants share rides and hitchhike, although walking or bicycling into the event is not allowed.

""Leave No Trace"" policy
Burning Man takes place in the middle of a large playa. While not inhabited by humans itself, the area around the playa is home to many animals and plants. Supporters of Burning Man point out that participants are encouraged to leave no trace (LNT) of their visit to Black Rock City (BRC) and to not contaminate the area with litter, commonly known as MOOP (Matter Out of Place). Despite the BLM and LLC's insistence on the practice of LNT, the amount of residual trash at the site has increased over the years.
While fire is a primary component of many art exhibits and events, materials must be burned on a burn platform. From 1990 through 1999, burning was allowed to take place directly on the surface of the playa, but this left burn scars (fired pinkish clay-like playa surface). When it was determined in 2000 that the burn scars do not dissipate with the annual winter rains and flooding, the organization declared that fires had to be elevated from the playa surface for its protection.
When it was discovered by two of the founders of the Friends of Black Rock / High Rock (Garth Elliott and Sue Weeks) and BLM Winnemucca district director Terry Reid that burn scars from prior sites (numbering 250) still remained, they were eradicated in 2000 by the DPW clean up crew headed by Dan Miller.
On the last day of the event, public shared burn areas are prepared for participants to use. It is an ongoing educational process each year to encourage participants to protect the environment and other participants by not burning toxic materials.
Even gray water is not to be dumped on the playa. Used shower water must be captured and either evaporated off or collected and carried home with participants or disposed of by roving septic-pumping trucks, which also service RVs. Methods used for evaporating water often include a plastic sheet with a wood frame.
The Bureau of Land Management, which maintains the desert, has very strict requirements for the event. These stipulations include trash cleanup, removal of burn scars, dust abatement, and capture of fluid drippings from participant vehicles. For four weeks after the event has ended, the Black Rock City Department of Public Works (BRC – DPW) Playa Restoration Crew remains in the desert, cleaning up after the temporary city in an effort to make sure that no evidence of the event remains.
In spite of the festival's clean up policies, Pershing County Sheriff Jerry Allen has stated that each festival ""typically leaves a fair amount of detritus littered across the desert"". He said that the leftover trash, including abandoned vehicles, was particularly heavy after the 2023 event.

Lawsuit against geothermal energy exploration
In 2023, Burning Man filed a lawsuit against exploration of geothermal energy, a renewable green energy source, in the Nevada desert. Subsequently, county commissioners rescinded a permit for the geothermal energy exploration, putting the project indefinitely on halt and potentially scuttling it all together. The Burning Man organization celebrated the move.

Environmental and sustainability efforts
Black Rock Solar: In 2008, Black Rock Solar was established to extend the Burning Man ethos of environmental responsibility beyond the festival. The organization provides solar power installations and training to underserved communities, aiming to promote clean energy and economic development. This initiative aligns with the festival’s values of Leave No Trace, which encourages participants to minimize their environmental impact.
Fly Ranch Acquisition: In 2016, the Burning Man Project acquired Fly Ranch, a 3,800-acre property near the festival site. Fly Ranch serves as a space for year-round experiments in sustainable living and art installations, furthering the community’s environmental goals. The acquisition reflects Burning Man's shift towards creating lasting impacts beyond the annual event

Criticism
Negative effects on the environment
Burning Man's carbon footprint is primarily from transportation to the remote area. The CoolingMan organization has estimated that the 2006 Burning Man was responsible for the generation of 27,000 tons of carbon dioxide, with 87% being from transportation to and from the location. In 2010, The Sierra Club criticized Burning Man for the ""hundreds of thousands"" of plastic water bottles that end up in landfills, as well as ostentatious displays of flames and explosions.
Burning Man's 2007 theme, ""Green Man,"" received criticism for the artwork Crude Awakening, a 99-foot (30 m) oil derrick that consumed 900 U.S. gallons (3,400 L) of jet fuel and 2,000 U.S. gallons (7,600 L) of liquid propane to blast a mushroom cloud 300 feet (91 m) high into the sky.
In an attempt to offset some of the event's carbon footprint, 30- and 50-kilowatt solar arrays were constructed in 2007 as permanent artifacts, providing an estimated annual carbon offset of 559 tons. The Burn Clean Project is a volunteer organization that has helped replace the use of fossil fuel with biodiesel. In 2023 a group of climate activists blockaded the road into Black Rock city.
Scientists have noted ""scars"" on the playa, the dry lake bed the festival takes place upon, especially during rainy years. The playa hosts fairy shrimp, water fleas and tadpole shrimp eggs which hatch only after rain and which may be harmed by mechanical damage to the playa during the event. Burning Man also increases wind erosion, which changes the way that the playa absorbs rain in the future.

Gentrification
Burning Man has attracted a number of billionaires and celebrities, many of them from Silicon Valley and Hollywood. It has become a networking event for them, with Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk once stating that Burning Man ""is Silicon Valley.""
These billionaires have paid for more luxurious camps to be set up in recent years. Derisively nicknamed ""plug-n-play"" or ""turnkey"" camps, they in general consist of lavish RVs and luxury restroom trailers that are driven into the city and connected together to form de facto gated areas. These billionaires then fly in to the airport on private planes, are driven to their camps, served by hired help, nicknamed ""sherpas"", and sleep in air-conditioned beds. One venture capitalist billionaire threw a $16,500-per-head party at his camp. In 2017, Google employees shipped in a box of lobsters for a meal.
Despite allowing the rich to participate in Burning Man per the ""radical inclusion"" principle, many traditional attendees have spoken out against their exclusive practices. Larry Harvey wrote that they also conflict with the ""radical self-reliance"" and other principles, but has also said that permitting the wealthy to attend is beneficial to Burning Man. Vandalism that occurred at the White Ocean sound camp in 2016 was said to have been a ""revolution"" against these attendees, describing them as a ""parasite class"" or ""rich parasites"".
Meanwhile, the regular admission price has increased over the years. In addition, Nevada lawmakers have modified the state's entertainment and sales tax code to include nonprofit organizations like Burning Man that sell more than 15,000 tickets. As a result, an individual ticket, including taxes, cost $424 in 2016. Even tickets sold under Burning Man's low-income program are subject to these taxes. Including transportation, food, camp fees, clothing and costumes, and gifts, CNBC estimated in 2016 that the total cost of attending could range from $1,300 up to $20,000. In 2017, Money magazine estimated an average total cost of $2,348 to attend.
According to the racial makeup of Burning Man attendees in 2014, 87% of them identified themselves as White, 6% as Hispanic / Latino, 6% as Asian, 2% as Native American, and 1% as Black (figures rounded). (Nevada's population, per the 2022 census, is 51% White, 29% Hispanic, 11% Asian, 2% Native, 11% Black). When interviewed by The Guardian about these figures, Harvey replied, ""I don't think Black folks like to camp as much as White folks... . We're not going to set racial quotas.... This has never been, imagined by us, as a utopian society.""
While there has been criticism that Burning Man has ""jumped the shark,"" this proposition was criticized by cultural anthropologist Graham St John in 2020, who said that Burning Man was never a utopia in the first place.

Criticism from conservatives and religious fundamentalists
Some conservative commentators have criticized Burning Man as sinful and hedonistic. For example, Ben Shapiro writes that Burning Man's ten principles are a ""paganistic morality"" which cover for hedonistic acts of sex and drug use. He holds the event as an example of ""countercultural garbage that eats at the roots of fundamental societal institutions"" in America. Similarly, James Goll and Lou Engle write that Burning Man ""exalts Satan, mocks God, and demeans Christianity"" because of its nudity, open sexuality, and neo-paganism.

Photography restrictions
The terms of the Burning Man ticket require that participants wishing to use photo and video-recording equipment share a joint copyright of their images of Black Rock City with Burning Man and forbid them from using their images for commercial purposes. This has been criticized by many, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). The amount of casual nudity at the event has significantly decreased over the years, due to the rise of ubiquitous cell phone cameras and the ability to easily upload photos to the Internet.
A Burning Man spokeswoman replied that the policies are not new, were written by a former head of the EFF, were used when suing to block pornographic videos, and ultimately arose from participant concerns: ""We're proud that Black Rock City (a private event held on public land) is widely acknowledged as a bastion of creative freedom. [B]ut that protection [of participants' freedoms] does necessitate the acceptance of some general terms of engagement when it comes to cameras.... EFF seems to think that anyone attending any event somehow has an absolute right to take photographs, and then to do whatever they want with those images without any effective restriction or manner of enforcement. While we believe that such rights do make sense for any of us taking pictures in purely public spaces, this is not true in the private space of Burning Man – if it were, it would mean that Burning Man couldn't protect participant privacy or prevent commercialization of imagery.""
The Burning Man organization has since worked with the EFF and with Creative Commons and other parties and has revised and clarified the photography policies.

Regional events
Burning Man's popularity has encouraged other groups and organizations to hold similar events, some of which serve as an epilogue for participants.
Burners have created smaller regional events modeled on Burning Man, such as Burning Flipside in Texas; Apogaea in Colorado; Playa del Fuego in Delaware; Firefly in New England; Kiwiburn in New Zealand; Blazing Swan in Australia; Transformus in West Virginia; AfrikaBurn in South Africa; NoWhere near Zaragoza in Spain; Midburn in Israel; and many others.
Some of the events are officially affiliated with the Burning Man organization via the Burning Man Regional Network. This official affiliation usually requires the event to conform to the 10 principles and certain standards outlined by the Burning Man organization and to be accompanied by a ""Burning Man Regional Contact,"" a volunteer with an official relationship to the Burning Man Project via a legal Letter of Agreement. The Netherlands was the first country outside the United States to have an event officially associated with Burning Man named Where the Sheep Sleep since 2016.
In exchange for conforming to these standards, the event is granted permission to officially communicate itself as a Burning Man Regional Event. The regional event organizers are enabled to exchange best practices with each other on a global level via online platforms and in-person conferences, which are partly sponsored by the Burning Man Project.

Created and produced by the non-profit arts organization Coney Island USA, the 40th annual parade was held on June 18, 2022.

Description
The Mermaid Parade traditionally takes place on the Saturday closest to the summer solstice, June 21, regardless of weather. Its intent is to celebrate self-expression, boost pride in Coney Island, and give New York artists a place to display their artwork.  There are no ethnic, religious, or commercial aims.
The parade pays homage to the Coney Island Mardi Gras parades of the early 20th century. During this era, Coney Island was the primary amusement park destination for those in the New York metropolitan area. Like the annual Village Halloween Parade, the Mermaid Parade evokes the artistic spirit of Mardi Gras.
The event typically attracts about 3,000 participants and hundreds of thousands of spectators from all five boroughs of New York City. After the last participant passes the reviewing stand, parade founder Dick Zigun leads the procession to the beach for a ceremony representing the opening of the ocean for the summer swimming season.

History
The tradition began in 1983, when the first event of this kind was conceptualized and organized by Dick Zigun, the founder of the non-profit arts organization Coney Island USA, who is sometimes dubbed the ""Mayor of Coney Island.""
The parade of June 22, 2013, was almost canceled due to a lack of money and resources following the recovery from Hurricane Sandy. It was rescued through a successful Kickstarter campaign that raised $117,000, more than the $100,000 goal.
The 2020 parade was replaced by a virtual event (The Tail-a-Thon) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The parade was delayed in 2021 to September 12 (marking the last weekend that lifeguards would be on duty at Coney Island) in order to improve the chances that it could be held, but on August 18 it was announced that the parade would be cancelled out of an abundance of caution due to a resurgence of COVID-19 in the region.

Themes
The Mermaid Parade is known for marine costumes and occasional nudity.  There are sections in the parade for vehicles of all kinds, for floats, for groups, and for individuals.  There are also family friendly and artsy categories.  The organizers of the parade claim to encourage bribery, to give participants a more equal chance to win the various costume contests which are also part of the day's entertainment.
Each year the Mermaid Parade features a King Neptune and Queen Mermaid.

Description
Many attendees of the Exotic Erotic Ball came to the event in elaborate and creative Halloween costumes to compete in the annual “Best Costume” contest which in later years typically awarded the winner prize money and merchandise in the US$10,000 range.
While the Exotic Erotic Ball by definition would be considered a ""Festival"" the event is rarely categorized into conventional terms by attendees, the media, or event organizers. Because of the broad spectrum of conventional and unconventional entertainment offered on multiple stages at the Exotic Erotic Ball, it may be described as a combination of Adult-themed; Halloween festival, Music Festival, Burlesque show, Lingerie party, Masquerade ball, Fetish club, Swingers party and Adult Industry Trade Show.

History
In 1978, The Nudist Ball, a precursor to the Exotic Erotic Ball, took place in Mann's Tenderloin, San Francisco, California apartment in 1978 and attracted a few hundred people.
In 1979, Perry Mann organized the first Exotic Erotic Ball, moving it to California Hall, in San Francisco, with 800 to 900 people paying $10 apiece, to raise campaign funds for his business partner and best friend, Louis Abolafia, who ran for President of the United States under the Nudist Party with the slogan: “I have nothing to hide.” Louis also coined the phrase, “Make love, not war!” and his legendary Greenwich Village love-ins inspired the New York press to crown him “The Love King.”  Abolafia had previously run in 1968 under the Cosmic Love Party, even then with the slogan ""What have I got to hide?"".
The Concourse Exhibition Center, 635 8th St, San Francisco was a long-time venue.
Around 1999, the location changed to the Cow Palace in Daly City.
In 2001, Mann released the book The Exotic Erotic Ball: Twenty Years of the World's Sexiest Party (ISBN 156171917X).
From 2004 through 2009, organizers expanded the Exotic Erotic Ball to include the Exotic Erotic Expo, a two-day Adult-Expo typically held the day before and the day of the Exotic Erotic Ball. Activities included panel discussions on First Amendment rights with adult actress, actors, and media, wine tastings with porn stars, and various oddities such as the ""spiritual oasis"" with psychic readings and massage, body painting, a classic adult cinema, and a human petting zoo. It also features a commercial area with vendors and exhibitors who showcase the latest in exotic fashion, erotic art, adult products, games, websites, and adult novelties.
In 2008, Snoop Dogg headlined a first-ever Friday night concert attached to the Exotic Erotic Ball and Exotic Erotic Expo.
In 2008, Treasure Island, San Francisco event, 26,341 people participated in the combined Exotic Erotic Ball and Exotic Erotic Expo.
In 2009, Art Mann Presents reported from the 2009 Exotic Erotic Ball, with Mistress Harley, celebrating its 30th year.
In 2010, the expo and ball relocated from the Cow Palace to the new Craneway Pavilion in Richmond, California. The move meant that instead of having 20,000 people, organizers would be limited to 14,000 attendees into the Craneway Pavilion on the Richmond waterfront over two days.  Organizers expected 7,500 attendees, but canceled the 2010 event the day before it was scheduled to occur, citing poor ticket sales  and cost overruns. Many longtime Exotic Erotic Ball attendees were apparently unwilling to travel to Richmond, an industrial city located 25 miles northeast of San Francisco, citing its longtime reputation for being crime-plagued (the city's own police department described Richmond as having a chronic violent crime problem for ""decades"" and in 2010 was ranked as the 6th most dangerous city in the United States).
In 2011, Howard Mark Mauskopf, 53, the owner of Perry Mann Productions, of Beverly Hills, which put on the 2009 Exotic Erotic Ball at the Cow Palace, faced felony charges for allegedly writing at least $10,000 worth of bad checks and using a fraudulent credit card to cover expenses for the event.
In 2011 and 2012, similar but unrelated events, Masquerotica and the XO Ball & Expo, respectively, filled the void left by the demise of the original Exotic Erotic.
In September 2011, Mann announced that they were ""pursuing an international opportunity"" and ""editing our 30-year documentary"" but not producing an event. They did recommend a new event called: Masquerotica, to be held on October 22, 2011, at The Concourse in San Francisco—one of the old Ball's longtime venues. In an announcement posted on the Exotic Erotic Ball's Website, Mann promised, ""You'll see a lot of familiar faces ... and other body parts."" Masquerotica is produced by different local event producers and other than being recommended by Mann has no affiliation to the Exotic Erotic Ball.
In September 2012, another similar but unrelated event, at Cow Palace, was the XO Ball and Expo.

Exotic Erotic New Year's Eve Ball
For several years, Mann also held an Exotic Erotic New Year's Eve Ball, but discontinued it in 1995.

Charities
The Exotic Erotic Ball fostered strong ties to the San Francisco community. Over the years, the Ball distributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to charities supporting causes such as helping the victims of natural disasters, AIDS, homelessness, domestic violence, child abuse, and has always supported freedom of expression and First Amendment Rights. The Exotic Erotic Ball hosted an annual blood drive with Blood Centers of the Pacific whereby free tickets were offered to those who donated blood.

History
The event is a project of (and fundraiser for) the non-profit World Peace Through Technology Organization, which describes it as ""an experiment in creating peace"" that brings a diverse audience together to find similarities and common ground, to accept and appreciate differences, and to celebrate creativity and peace. There are many stages of music, performances, and vendors from around the world at the event. The event also features live and exhibited artwork, including an area called ""Art Alley"". Occurring in late Spring, the How Weird Street Faire is considered by many to be the start of San Francisco's street fair and outdoor event season. The name ""How Weird Street Faire"" alludes to the venue, Howard Street, as well as the street's namesake William Davis Merry Howard (1819-1856).
The festival has included workshops, fashion shows, and even a ""peace game"". Several charities set up booths with information about topics such as peace and sustainability. Some of the speakers who have talked about technology and peace include R. U. Sirius, Joe Firmage, Craig Newmark (founder of Craigslist), and San Francisco City Supervisors Mark Leno and Chris Daly.
In 2003, a CD was released titled ""How Weird Street Faire CD Vol. 1"" featuring ten songs from artists who had played at the event. The album features songs from Irina Mikhailova, Adam Ohana, Shakatura, Quasar, Penta, Ocelot, Biodegradable, Kode IV, Waterjuice, and Bassnectar. The album was released by Ceiba Records. The mission of the album and the music was to inspire peace.
The How Weird Street Faire attracts thousands of people in colorful costumes, featuring a different theme each year. The 10th annual event was held on May 10, 2009, with the theme of ""Rebooting the Motherboard"". The 11th annual event was held on May 9, 2010, with the theme of ""Bollyweird: The Cosmic Dance"".

The How Weird Street Faire won the SF Weekly’s 2018 Best of SF award for “street fair that continues to improve and blow our minds”. The event was named one of the 10 Best Cultural Festivals in America by USA Today in 2019.
2020 saw the first How Weird World Faire, a virtual fair.

The parade, which uses the motto ""Putting the 'nut' in Coconut Grove"", is composed of floats mocking local and national stories from the previous year.

History
The King Mango Strut was started in 1982 by Glenn Terry and Bill Dobson as a parody of the annual King Orange Jamboree Parade for the Orange Bowl. After Terry and Dobson's group, the Mango Marching Band, was denied entry into the King Orange Jamboree Parade due to their use of kazoos, conch shells, and garbage can drums as instruments, the pair held their own parade, with an initially by simply marking the ends of a street with signs.
In 2009 Glenn Terry and group treasurer Antoinette Baldwin got into a public dispute over the creative direction of the Strut, which culminated in the city choosing Baldwin to run the event, and Terry refusing to march in the parade in protest. The parade is now run by King Mango Productions, a non-profit organization headed by Mike Lucas.
The Strut was on hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic and is resuming for 2022 on January 8, 2023.

Overview
The parade lampoons both local and national figures and issues. In 1986, the parade included a group of people dressed as members of the sex and drug trades, calling themselves the ""Biscayne Boulevard Chamber of Commerce"". In 1996 several floats poked fun at the City of Miami's debt crisis, including a mock auction of city buildings. In 1997 and 2000, floats mocked the area's history of voting irregularities, with the latter year focusing on the issues the state faced during the 2000 presidential election.
There is no stringent entry process for participants. Simply showing up to a meeting and announcing a desire to participate is enough. In one case, a group showed up on the day of the event, with no prior notice, and was allowed to march with the parade.  The Miami chapter of the Sierra Club has participated since 1988, and a local Hare Krishna group is also a long time participant.

Historical timeline
In 1973, an informal parade of puppets for children was organized by Ralph Lee of the Mettawee River Theatre Company around his residence of artists in the Westbeth Artists Community. The next year, the parade went from Jane Street at the Hudson River to Washington Square Park.  About 200 adults and children participated. The 1975 parade was produced by the Theatre for the New City (which at the time was in Westbeth).  Lee and the Theatre won Obie Award for the production.  The 1975 parade grew to 1,500 participants.  The new management introduced more adult elements into the event including a Halloween ball after the parade. Organization of the parade was formally handled by a non-profit organization starting in 1976.
In 1977, the route was changed to 10th Street between Greenwich Avenue to Fifth Avenue and still ending in Washington Square.  A devil sat at the top of the Washington Square arch where it released balloons and slid down a wire into the fountain.  The year also saw the first appearance of giant spider on the Jefferson Market Library. The parade continued to start at Westbeth until 1983. Two years later, with crowds expanding to 250,000, the route was moved from side streets to Sixth Avenue from Spring Street to 22nd Street (although in practice the gathering point was further south at Canal Street and the northern point would be shortened to 16th Street.  The change in route ended the connection to Washington Square Park. Jeanne Fleming became the Artistic and Producing Director.
In 1990, New York University and Manhattan Community Board 2 begin hosting an unrelated Children's Halloween Parade in Greenwich Village in the afternoons in Washington Square. Sophia Michahelles and Alex Kahn become the official designers of the parade's puppets in 1998, and the following year, Basil Twist designed the spider that currently appears on the Jefferson Market Library.
Less than seven weeks after the September 11 attacks in 2001, the parade was broadcast worldwide and was an indication that New York was bouncing back.  The parade was led by a giant puppet of a Phoenix rising out of the ashes.  Noticeably missing from the parade was Bread and Puppet Theater which had been a political staple of the parade but was protesting the new War in Afghanistan. Earlier the Bread and Puppet contingent consisted of five blocks of its giant puppets. Similarly, less than 8 weeks after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, more than 8,000 storm evacuees attended a funeral procession tribute as part of the parade. In 2010, Haitian Carnival Artist Didier Civil created Haitian carnival figures as a tribute to victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake.
The parade was cancelled for the first time in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which had heavily damaged coastal New York City and had left Greenwich Village without electricity during the parade time. The next year, a Kickstarter campaign to cover costs of the 2012 closing saved the parade from permanently closing. The campaign raised $56,000, surpassing its goal of $50,000.
Less than four hours after eight people were killed six blocks west of the parade route in the 2017 New York City truck attack, the parade proceeded as scheduled. Both Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo marched in the parade.
In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, the parade was canceled for the first time in eight years. The parade's organizers cited concerns that social distancing would be impossible with the high crowds that the parade typically saw.

Theme
In 2001, the parade presented a work of puppetry that would become celebrated for its artistry, and remembered in the city's history. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, events citywide and nationwide were being either scrapped or postponed. Organizers believed the parade would give the city a much-needed emotional release, reform the community, and help it to begin the healing process. They felt that this was the most positive way they, as artists, could serve the city at such a desperate time. ""This is the meaning of the Dancing Skeletons that always lead the march: they know better than anyone what they have lost, and so they dance this one night of the year to celebrate life,"" Fleming told CNN in an interview.
By September 15, Fleming had scrapped the old theme and chosen a new one. Although no one was certain the parade would take place, designer Sophia Michahelles conceived of a new theme, Phoenix Rising, to galvanize the spirit of New York in the wake of the tragedy.  A giant puppet of a phoenix, the mythical bird that rises up out of its own ashes, was created by Michahelles in the workshop of Official Parade Puppeteers Superior Concept Monsters. The animated creation was mechanically configured to spread its wings and rise out of fiery ashes, represented by flickering lanterns lifted on poles, encircling the parading figure. On October 25 the parade received final authorization to go ahead. In light of the widely established community relationships which Fleming had cultivated, and the parade's long tradition, Mayor Rudy Giuliani insisted it go on.

Cultural impact
The parade has been studied by leading cultural anthropologists. According to The New York Times, ""the Halloween Parade is the best entertainment the people of this City ever give the people of this City."" ""Absolutely anything goes,"" says USA Today. ""Be prepared to drop your jaw.""
The parade is also themed in the video game Tycoon City: New York, published in 2006.

The festival is the main event held by the Free State Project, a libertarian organization that advocates for the relocation of libertarians to New Hampshire in order to make the state a stronghold for their movement. The festival has been described as ""the libertarian version of Burning Man"" and ""the largest gathering of libertarians in the world"".

The festival has been described as ""the libertarian version of Burning Man"" and ""the largest gathering of libertarians in the world"". The festival on average hosts approximately 1,500 attendees.

Background
The Free State Project originated from a 2001 essay by then-Yale University student (and later lecturer at Dartmouth College) Jason Sorens. The idea behind the project is to get 20,000 libertarians to move to New Hampshire, a state with a low population where a group of that size could yield significant political influence. By 2014, about 1,500 libertarians had already moved to the state, and several ""Free Staters"" have been elected to the state government, including Andrew Prout of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. The Free State Project hosts two annual events in the state: The New Hampshire Liberty Forum, a convention-style event, and the Porcupine Freedom Festival, which is a weeklong event held at a campground in Lancaster, New Hampshire.

History
The festival began in 2004, one year after New Hampshire was selected as the target state for the Free State Project. The festival is named after the porcupine, which serves as a mascot for the Free State Movement.
The festival is known for its embrace of cryptocurrencies and precious metals over Federal Reserve Notes, as most vendors accept cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Dogecoin. In 2013, Vitalik Buterin, the creator of the cryptocurrency Ethereum, attended the 2013 PorcFest along with Erik Voorhees, an early embracer of Bitcoin and a member of the Free State Project. A 2011 episode of Planet Money discussed the prevalence of forges at the festival for the purposes of working precious metals (silver in the case of the episode) into smaller units for sales transactions.
The event in 2020, held during the COVID-19 pandemic, attracted over 1,000 attendees. Jeffrey Tucker of the American Institute for Economic Research gave a presentation at the festival wherein he argued against the COVID-19 lockdowns.
The event in 2021, for the first time since 2004, was a sold out event. It sold out again in 2022.

In the original invitation, spread throughout the United States in 1971, the ""Rainbow Family Tribe"" referred to themselves as ""brothers & sisters, children of God"", ""Families of life on Earth"", ""Friends of Nature & of all People"" and ""Children of Humankind"". All  races, nations, politicians, etc. were invited in the desire that there could be peace among all people. The goal was to create what they believed was a more satisfying culture — free from consumerism, capitalism, and mass media — one that would be non-hierarchical, that would further world peace, and serve as a model for reforms to mainstream society. However, the values actually exhibited by the group have at times varied quite a bit from this ideal, with recent decades showing increasing levels of crime at the events, and some organizers stating the core principles have been modified, and become more mainstream, in an effort to attract more people.
Influenced by 1960s counterculture and the non-commercial rock festivals of the early 1970s, Rainbow is a ""revitalization movement"" with many philosophies and practices that have roots in the historic utopian traditions of the mid-19th century. The first Rainbow Gathering was held in Colorado in 1972 and was attended by more than 20,000 people. In the 1980s, gatherings started to form outside of North America as autonomous, but connected events around the world.
Media coverage of Rainbow Gatherings since the 1980s has described Rainbow Gathering attendees with terms such as ""aging hippies"", ""grown-up flower children"", or ""middle-aged white folks"". In the 2000s, the media focus shifted to the increase in crime in the local communities closest to Gatherings, ranging from petty crimes like retail theft to violent assaults and serious traffic charges, such as driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Despite the movement's environmentalist and pacifist aspirations, Gatherings, which are typically held in national forests and other ecologically sensitive areas, are described as having a negative impact on the local environment. Participants have developed a reputation for excessive drug and alcohol use, in addition to engaging in disruptive and criminal activity. This has resulted in increased police presence at Gatherings and a poor reception from area residents and business owners in nearby towns. Cultural appropriation and misrepresentation of Native American traditions and beliefs have also given the Gathering a poor reception from nearby reservations. In the U.S., these issues are also contributing factors in the decline in attendance at regional and national Gatherings.","Rainbow Gatherings are temporary, loosely knit communities of people, who congregate in remote forests around the world for one or more weeks at a time with the stated intention of living a shared ideology of peace, harmony, freedom, and respect. In the original invitation, spread throughout the United States in 1971, the ""Rainbow Family Tribe"" referred to themselves as ""brothers & sisters, children of God"", ""Families of life on Earth"", ""Friends of Nature & of all People"" and ""Children of Humankind"". All  races, nations, politicians, etc. were invited in the desire that there could be peace among all people. The goal was to create what they believed was a more satisfying culture — free from consumerism, capitalism, and mass media — one that would be non-hierarchical, that would further world peace, and serve as a model for reforms to mainstream society. However, the values actually exhibited by the group have at times varied quite a bit from this ideal, with recent decades showing increasing levels of crime at the events, and some organizers stating the core principles have been modified, and become more mainstream, in an effort to attract more people.
Influenced by 1960s counterculture and the non-commercial rock festivals of the early 1970s, Rainbow is a ""revitalization movement"" with many philosophies and practices that have roots in the historic utopian traditions of the mid-19th century. The first Rainbow Gathering was held in Colorado in 1972 and was attended by more than 20,000 people. In the 1980s, gatherings started to form outside of North America as autonomous, but connected events around the world.
Media coverage of Rainbow Gatherings since the 1980s has described Rainbow Gathering attendees with terms such as ""aging hippies"", ""grown-up flower children"", or ""middle-aged white folks"". In the 2000s, the media focus shifted to the increase in crime in the local communities closest to Gatherings, ranging from petty crimes like retail theft to violent assaults and serious traffic charges, such as driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Despite the movement's environmentalist and pacifist aspirations, Gatherings, which are typically held in national forests and other ecologically sensitive areas, are described as having a negative impact on the local environment. Participants have developed a reputation for excessive drug and alcohol use, in addition to engaging in disruptive and criminal activity. This has resulted in increased police presence at Gatherings and a poor reception from area residents and business owners in nearby towns. Cultural appropriation and misrepresentation of Native American traditions and beliefs have also given the Gathering a poor reception from nearby reservations. In the U.S., these issues are also contributing factors in the decline in attendance at regional and national Gatherings.

Background
Rainbow Gatherings and the Rainbow Family of Living Light (usually abbreviated to ""Rainbow Family"") claim to express utopian impulses, bohemianism, hipster and hippie culture. The gatherings have roots clearly traceable to the counterculture of the 1960s.
Rainbow Gatherings have their own jargon, which helps to create a sense of community and the ability to express their thoughts on society and social justice. In particular, mainstream society is commonly referred to and viewed as ""Babylon"" - a term also used by Rastafarian culture - from the Christian New Testament connoting the participants' widely held belief that modern lifestyles and systems of government are unhealthy, unsustainable, exploitative and out of harmony with the natural systems of the planet.

History
The original Rainbow Gathering was in 1972, and since then gatherings have been held annually in the United States from July 1 through 7 every year on National Forest land.  Throughout the year, regional and international gatherings are held in the United States and in many other places around the world.
The first Rainbow Gathering of the Tribes was a four-day event in Colorado in July 1972. It was organized by youth counterculture ""tribes"" (youth communes) of the Rainbow Family, based in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. The first three days of the festival took place at Strawberry Lake, outside of Granby, Colorado. The lake is in a wooded area elevated 900 feet (270 m) above the surrounding area. Campsites surrounded the lake, and there was no event stage of any kind. On the final day, July 4, 1972, most in attendance migrated to Table Mountain, a barren summit located a mile away from the lake. This was ostensibly for the noon sighting of a white buffalo, as had been envisioned/prophesied by Barry ""Plunker"" Adams, a spiritual leader of the Family. A week before the festival was to begin, local authorities banned the event and state police blocked the road to the lake. A film of the 1972 Gathering states that Paul Geisendorfer, a local landowner, offered his land as a temporary site as over 10,000 attendees gathered behind police barriers. While there were hundreds of arrests, the huge number of attendees caused authorities to stand down and let them pass through the barriers. Estimates of attendance vary between 20,000 and 45,000.
The first gathering was intended to be a one-time event; however, a second gathering in Wyoming the following year materialized, at which point an annual event was declared. The length of the gatherings has since expanded beyond the original four-day span, as have the number and frequency of the gatherings.
Although groups from California and the Northwest region of the U.S. were heavily involved in the first Rainbow Gathering, the U.S. Southeast was strongly represented as well.  At least 2,600 people from throughout that region attended and provided support for the 1972 Rainbow Gathering of the Tribes on Strawberry Lake, above Granby, Colorado. There was also strong representation from other regions of the U.S.
In 2017, the United States gathering was held near the 1.4 million acres (5,700 km2) Malheur National Forest in eastern Oregon. Between 10,000 and 18,000 attended the multi-day event, near Flagtail Meadow, with the largest crowds expected on July 4. The 50th Annual Rainbow Gathering took place in Taos County, New Mexico, in July 2021.
The 50th anniversary gathering in July 2022 was held in Routt National Forest, Colorado, with over 10,000 in attendance.

Social aspects
Non-commercialism
As Michael Niman notes, ""Rainbow Gatherings, as a matter of principle, are free and non-commercial."" Using money to buy or sell anything at Rainbow Gatherings is taboo. There are no paid organizers, although there are volunteers (""focalizers"") who are crucial to setting up the gathering site. Participants are expected to contribute money, labor, and/or material. All labor is voluntary and never formally compensated; conversely, there is no monetary cost or prior obligation required to attend a Rainbow Gathering.

Aside from taking up collections (the ""Magic Hat"" in Rainbow parlance) for essential items purchased from the local community, there is little or no exchange of currency internally at a Gathering. The primary principle is that necessities should be freely shared, while luxuries can be traded. A designated trading area is a feature at most U.S. Gatherings. It is called ""trading circle"" if it is circular and ""barter lane"" if it is linear. Frequently traded items include items such as sweets (often referred to as ""zuzus""), books, zines, crystals, rocks, gems, and handcrafts. In some rare cases people may even trade marijuana or smoking pipes (usually when no police are in the area). Snickers bars have emerged as a semi-standardized unit of exchange at some gatherings.

Non-membership
There are no official leaders, no formal structure, no official spokespersons, and no membership. Some rainbow family participants make the claim that the family is the ""largest non-organization of non-members in the world"". In addition to referring to itself as a non-organization, the Rainbow Family of Living Light's ""non-members"" also playfully call the movement a ""disorganization"". However, there is a changing network of ""focalizers"" who take responsibility for passing on Rainbow information year-round, and serve as contacts listed in the Rainbow Guide.

Consensus process
Gatherings are loosely maintained by open, free form counsel circles consisting of any ""non-members"" who wish to be part of a conversation, which use consensus process for making decisions. According to the Mini-manual, ""Recognized Rainbow guidelines come from only one source, a main Counsel circle at the annual gatherings.""
Talking circles are also a feature of rainbow gatherings. Each participant in the circle talks in turn while all others present listen in silence. A ritual talking stick, feather or other object is passed around the circle to allow everyone the opportunity to speak without being interrupted; this is a custom appropriated from Indigenous peoples of North America.

Creativity and spirituality
One of the central features of the annual U.S. gathering is silent meditation on the morning of the Fourth of July, with attendees gathering in a circle in the Main Meadow. At approximately noon the assembly begins a collective ""Om"" which is ended with whooping and a celebration. A parade of children comes from the Kiddie Village, singing and dancing into the middle of the circle.
Spiritually, there is a strong tradition of cultural appropriation. Native American leaders of several tribes have spoken out against the Rainbows' misappropriation of their religious ceremonies as well as their trespassing onto Native sacred sites.
Many spiritual traditions are represented, often with their own kitchen, from Hare Krishnas to Orthodox Jews to several denominations of Christianity and many others.
Creative events may include variety shows, campfire singing, fire-juggling, and large or small art projects. At one gathering, a cable car was rigged to carry groups of four quickly across a meadow. Faerie Camp was ""alive with hundreds of bells and oddly illuminated objects"". Musicians and music pervade all Gatherings, at kitchens, on the trails, and at campfires.

Gathering logistics
The Rainbow Family has governed Gatherings of up to 30,000 people. Regional Rainbow gatherings can attract as many as 5,000. The U.S. annual rainbow gathering occurs around July 1-7th, but people come up to a month earlier to help set up (this is known as ""Seed Camp"") and remain on-site up to a month later to participate in cleanup and to perform site restorations.
Although each event is more or less anarchic, practical guidelines have been reached through the consensus process and are documented in a ""Mini-manual"". Items that are strongly discouraged, by some, at gatherings include firearms, alcohol, tobacco, and pets. Other items that tend to be discouraged include radios, tape players, sound amplifiers, and power tools.

Camps and kitchens
Camps and kitchens are the basic community units of the Gathering. Camps may be based on regional, spiritual, or even dietary commonalities. For example, Kid Village attracts attendees with children, Tea Time specializes in serving herbal teas, Jesus Camp has a  Christian foundation. Some kitchens such as the Turtle Soup Kitchen serve predominantly vegetarian meals. Lovin' Ovens is a kitchen that craft ovens out of metal drums, clay, and mud in the area and will cook food such as pizza (meat, vegetarian, and vegan) and different types of bread and snacks. Nic@Nite is a camp that focuses on the sharing of tobacco and tobacco-related products.
Not all camps are kitchens, but all kitchens are camps. In addition to feeding passers-by, kitchens send food to the one or two large communal, predominantly vegetarian meals served daily in the main meadow.

Water and sanitation
Drinking water is filtered at gatherings, both by small pump filters and large gravity-feed devices. Attendees are encouraged also to boil drinking water.  Water is often tapped at a source (such as a spring or stream) and runs hundreds of yards to main kitchens in the gathering via plastic hosing.
Sanitation has historically been a major concern at Rainbow Gatherings. Human waste is deposited in latrine trenches (typically referred to as 'shitters') and treated with lime and ash from campfires. New latrines are dug and filled in daily. However sanitation may still be inadequate: the 1987 gathering in North Carolina experienced a large outbreak of highly contagious shigellosis (a.k.a. dysentery), and a smaller outbreak occurred in association with a 2018 gathering in Poland.

C.A.L.M.
C.A.L.M., or the Center for Alternative Living Medicine, is the primary group of doctors at Rainbow Gatherings who assist people with health and wellness and take responsibility for medical emergencies and sanitation of those who attend these large gatherings.
It is an all volunteer, non-hierarchical group encompassing both mainstream, conventional medicine and alternative medicine, such as naturopathic healing modalities. It is common to find physicians working with herbalists, EMTs helping massage therapists and naturopaths coordinating with Registered Nurses on patient care. C.A.L.M. works closely with the Shanti peace army, as they are often the first on the scene in a crisis. There is usually one main C.A.L.M. camp near the inner part of the gatherings and smaller first aid stations set up around the Gatherings. Even those without medical experience are encouraged to help with things such as procuring water and cooking for the healers, who are often too busy to attend main circle or visit other kitchens. In case of any emergency, CALM can be contacted on FRS Channel 3 (no tones, 462.6125 MHz UHF) and other site-specific radio frequencies.

Shanti Sena
Within the Rainbow Gathering, security, conflict resolution, and emergency situations are handled by Shanti Sena (""peace army"" in Sanskrit), which includes anyone who is capable of helping at that time. Shanti Sena also sometimes acts as liaisons to observers and law enforcement officers who patrol the Rainbow Gathering, often tracking the movements of police and park rangers through the gathering, and overseeing the interactions between officers and people attending the gathering to ensure that neither group instigates or takes part in illegal or inflammatory confrontations. This type of interference with police operations resulted in numerous arrests in the 1987 gathering in North Carolina, with state, federal and local officers being assaulted, blocked from patrol areas and threatened. The Shanti Sena at the '87 gathering were characterized by local, state, and federal officers as a criminal gang and were suspected to have collaborated in the assault on an Asheville Citizen-Times reporter. Several gathering attendees who reported they had been expelled from the gathering called the Shanti Sena ""gestapo"" and thugs. In some particularly serious situations, Shanti Sena have collaborated with law enforcement (although without violating the Gathering's principle of consensus). For example, a gathering regular and wanted murder suspect, Joseph Geibel, was peacefully approached by Shanti Sena and transferred to police custody at the 1998 gathering.
The phrase is also used as a call for aid. If individuals find themselves in a dispute, they can shout ""Shanti Sena"". Everyone within earshot is expected to then approach the scene calmly, de-escalate where possible, and eventually reach a consensus agreement to settle the dispute.

Difficulties and criticisms
Difficulties include:

The often unacknowledged class and power structures of the Rainbow community and its events
The phenomenon of ""Drainbows""—individuals who are perceived to not give sufficiently of their labor or other resources for the common good, but rather are only consuming the social benefits a Rainbow gathering offers (a classic cooperation problem)
Relationships with both the Forest Service as well as local communities and other stakeholders in National Forest lands (both commercial interests as well as local environmentalists, who are often concerned about Gathering impacts)
The Spring Council of the Rainbow Family does not inform the U.S. Forest Service of the gathering location until a few days prior to the event
Damage to forest lands, campgrounds and facilities, with human waste, trash and other mess such as abandoned vehicles
Occasionally the site selection process does not run smoothly resulting in a split gathering (1993); or in very low attendance either due to a dispute over the legitimacy of the site (2015) or in light of the COVID-19 pandemic
In recent years, there have been increasing reports of drifters and vagrants who attach themselves to gatherings where they engage in hard drug use, sexual assault, theft and violence. In 2014, Heber City, Utah police arrested Leilani Novak-Garcia, known as ""Hitler"", who repeatedly stabbed a man at the annual gathering after he tried to stop her honking her car horn. Novak-Garcia pleaded no contest to the charges and served 300 days in jail.
Jose Antonio Ramos, who was identified in 1985 and again in 2004 as the primary suspect in the disappearance of Etan Patz, attended and was removed from the Rainbow Gathering twice in the 1980s and was convicted of molesting an 8-year-old boy at a gathering in Pennsylvania. Rainbow elder Barry Adams helped to identify and convict Ramos. Ramos served a 20-year prison sentence in the State Correctional Institution in Dallas, Pennsylvania, for child molestation. He was released from prison on November 7, 2012. Soon after his release he was arrested on a Megan's Law violation.

Cost to local and federal governments
Local jurisdictions bear costs. For example, the 2013 gathering in Beaverhead County, Montana experienced uncollectible patient charges for emergency room care and additional costs incurred at the county's hospital, which totaled an estimated $175,000.
Cost to federal government of $573,000 according to Tim Walther, assistant special agent in charge of law enforcement for the Forest Service.  A total of 850 incident reports, written warnings and citations were recorded during the event.  Of these, 405 incident reports were written up for Rainbow people not following the operational plan agreed upon by the Rainbows and the Forest Service.

Relations with law enforcement
In an October 2008 report the American Civil Liberties Union stated:

The U.S. Forest Service systematically harasses people who attend Rainbow Family gatherings on public lands.
In 2016, the American Civil Liberties Union in Vermont issued a report expressing concern over federal law enforcement activities that the ACLU describe as ""overzealous"" and ""unconstitutional"". The ACLU-VT sent letters to law enforcement officials calling for an end to the illegal targeting of Rainbow Gathering attendees expressing First Amendment rights on public land. In an October 2008 report the American Civil Liberties Union stated, ""The U.S. Forest Service systematically harasses people who attend Rainbow Family gatherings on public lands.""
All major gatherings in the United States are held on National Forest land, which is under the jurisdiction of the United States Forest Service, a federal agency with its own federal law enforcement officers. County sheriffs have concurrent jurisdiction on all forest lands, as do county police and local police depending on location, community boundaries and local laws. So too do state law enforcement agencies, namely state wildlife wardens, state troopers and state police or bureaus of investigation. Many local gatherings occur in remote areas, with county sheriffs being the primary responders. They often request deputies from neighboring counties and officers from area police departments. Additionally, it is common for state conservation and wildlife officers and state troopers to deploy personnel. The Forest Service has often received assistance from the FBI, US Marshalls for fugitives, DEA for drug trafficking and other federal agencies. The USFS has tried to prevent these gatherings from taking place; it denies all others access to the forest and the surrounding area for the duration of the gathering   or insists that a group-use permit be signed, contending that this is standard practice for large groups wishing to camp on public land and that it is necessary to protect public safety and the local environment. Gathering organizers generally contend that the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights give them the right to peaceably assemble on public land and that requiring a permit would violate that basic right by turning it into a privilege to be regulated.
In 1984, the Forest Service enacted a regulation requiring a permit for any expressive assembly of ten or more people on Forest Service lands. This was unenforced for a year and a half before the Service attempted to apply it to the gathering in Arizona in 1986. Judge Bilby called attention to the selective enforcement of the regulation, and in any case ruled it unconstitutional, in part because it required expressive assemblies, but not non-expressive ones, to obtain permits.
The U.S. government has in the past pressured individuals to be representatives of the Gathering (e.g., by signing a permit).  However, this is in violation of the well-established Rainbow principle that ""no individual may officially represent the Family as a whole."" A number of court cases have resulted from both Forest Service prosecutions and Rainbow Family-inspired legal actions against enforcement activities; among other legal defeats, the Forest Service found itself rebuffed by the judge in a defendant class suit originating from the 1987 North Carolina Gathering. In a notable account of Gathering relations with law enforcement, Judge Dave and the Rainbow People, was written by U.S. Federal Judge David Sentelle. The book provides a firsthand account of Sentelle's role in presiding over the 1987 case brought by the State of North Carolina in an attempt to stop the Gathering, including site visits to the Gathering and related legal actions. Garrick Beck, a Rainbow Family organizer involved in the 1987 case, wrote an afterword to the book in which he expresses agreement with Sentelle's characterizations. In that particular gathering, numerous state arrests were made for breaches of the peace, alcohol and traffic violations and interfering with officers. The federal court allowed the NC gathering to continue, but when attendees overstayed their time allocation, they were forcibly removed and arrested by state and federal officers. Damage to the Slick Rock area of Nantaha National Forest was estimated to be in the tens of thousands of dollars. An outbreak of bloody diarrhea occurred and at least two kidnapped minors were rescued from the camp in two separate incidents.
The Forest Service has dealt with the scale of the US Annual Rainbow Gathering in the past by assigning a Type 2 National Incident Management Team (NIMT). Around 40 personnel from the NIMT have been assigned in the past, including NIMT members, Forest Service law enforcement officers (LEOs) and resource advisors.  Because the Rainbow Gathering has utilized the land in the past without required consent from the Forest Service, the gatherings have been given special attention, since, under current Forestry rules and regulations, they may occur illegally.
In 1999 and again in 2000, the NIMT selected three gathering participants who were charged with ""use or occupancy of National Forest System lands without authorization."" The citation carried a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $5,000 fine; the charges originally could have been cleared by paying a $100 fine. Instead, they all chose to fight it in court, but lost their appeals. The three 1999 cases were later turned down by the Supreme Court.
At the 2008 National Gathering in Wyoming, an incident occurred whereby Forest Service officers tried to arrest an attendee at the gathering. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service said that about 400 participants in the Gathering began to advance, throwing sticks and rocks at the officers, although this was disputed by Gathering participants and video evidence. Pepper balls were then fired to control the crowd.  Witnesses reported that officers pointed weapons at children and fired rubber bullets at gathering participants.  The ACLU produced a report following their investigation of the incident in which they were critical of the officers for engaging in a pattern of harassment, using overzealous enforcement techniques, and using small violations as a pretense for larger searches.

Alcohol
According to the guidelines, or Raps of the Rainbow Gathering, open and public consumption of alcohol is discouraged by many people at the gatherings with respect for others being the primary reason. A distinguishing characteristic of the U.S. annual gatherings is ""A-Camp,"" (commonly, and mistakenly, thought to mean ""alcohol camp"") typically located near the front gate, where some of those who want to openly drink alcohol usually stay, yet public drinking is generally accepted in most camps close to the road. Gatherings in Europe do not have ""A-Camps.""  Some gatherings in Canada have ""A-Camps"" and some do not. Wine is tolerated in moderation at some European gatherings, particularly in France, where it is customary to drink wine with the evening meal.

Confusion over Hopi legend
There has been a long-standing Rainbow rumor that the Gathering is recognized by the elders of the Hopi people as the fulfillment of an ancient Hopi prophecy (some versions substitute Hopi with the Ojibwe people). Sometimes referred to as the Legend of the Rainbow Warriors, it was debunked as fakelore by writer Michael Niman in the 1997 book People of the Rainbow: A Nomadic Utopia. While researching the legend, Niman interviewed Thomas Banyaca, a Hopi selected by elders in the 1950s to interpret and pass on Hopi prophecies. According to Niman, Banyaca was ""puzzled about the supposed Hopi prophecy"" and said, ""It's not right...We hope they will stop it"".
Although Banyaca was unfamiliar with the Rainbow Family, he was aware of the Rainbow Warrior myth and said it was invented by two non-Native, Evangelical Christians, William Willoya and Vinson Brown. Willoya and Brown had briefly met with Banyaca before publishing Warriors of the Rainbow in 1962, a Christian tract in which they fabricated the Rainbow Warrior concept, claiming it was an ancient Native American legend and a prophecy about the Second Coming of Christ. According to Niman, the rainbow in Willoya and Brown's version was a reference to the rainbow in the Book of Genesis. Niman said Rainbows who likely don't recognize the Biblical overtones continue to cite Warriors of the Rainbow and mischaracterize it as containing a message that aligns with the Rainbow ideology, often inventing entirely new versions of the myth that they still attribute to Willoya and Brown's 1962 tract. He said, ""I think that Rainbows need to shed that because there's so much associated with the Rainbow Gathering that is real, that is legitimate. You don't need to say that it's an Indian prophecy. And Rainbows are picking up on this and are sensitive to it and I don't really see much fakelore compared to a few years back, which is impressive. This is an ongoing, evolving culture and it can adapt and clean itself up"".

Cultural expropriation
In 2015, a group of Native American academics and writers issued a statement against the Rainbow Gathering attendees who are ""appropriating and practicing faux Native ceremonies and beliefs. These actions, although Rainbows may not realize, dehumanize us as an indigenous Nation because they imply our culture and humanity, like our land, is anyone's for the taking."" The signatories specifically named this misappropriation as ""cultural exploitation"".

Deaths
In 1980, the bodies of two women were found after the gathering at Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia and attendees were questioned about possible involvement. They had been shot dead during the gathering. There had been tension between local residents and ""hippies"", and police concluded that local men led by Greenbrier County resident Jacob Beard were responsible. Beard was convicted in 1999, but exonerated on appeal in 2000 and received a $2 million settlement for wrongful conviction. White supremacist Joseph Paul Franklin confessed to the murders but later revealed he had just read about them. The killers remain at large and filmmaker Julia Huffman is working on a documentary, The Rainbow Murders, hoping to bring more facts to light. Emma Copley Eisenberg wrote about the murders and their impact in the 2020 book The Third Rainbow Girl.
In July 2011, a woman named Marie Hanson, from South Lake Tahoe, California went missing in Skookum Meadow, Washington state while attending the 2011 Rainbow Gathering at Gifford Pinchot National Forest. The local Sheriff's office reportedly initially refused to use tracking dogs at the site, stating they were not certain a crime had taken place. After pleas by the Hanson family and the Rainbow Family, a series of four searches by Rainbow Gathering attendees, law enforcement and the Hanson Family took place during late summer and fall of 2011. In October 2011, human remains and jewelry were found near the woman's campsite. It was later confirmed that the remains were those of Marie Hanson.
In 2011, four fatalities from natural causes occurred at Rainbow Gatherings, including two deaths at the 2011 Washington State national Rainbow Gathering. The Washington State deaths were those of Amber Kellar, a 28-year-old Californian who died of a preexisting medical condition, and Steve Pierce, a 50-year-old Californian who died of a heart attack.  In February 2011, a man drowned in a Farles Prairie pond during a regional Rainbow Gathering in Ocala National Forest, Florida.
In 2015, at a regional gathering at Apalachicola National Forest in Florida, 24-year-old attendee Wesley ""Dice"" Jones was shot and paralyzed by Clark Mayers, 39, of Milledgeville, Georgia. Another attendee, Jacob Cardwell, known as ""Smiley"", threw himself over Dice and was himself shot and killed. Other gathering attendees then beat and stabbed Mayers, who spent two weeks in the hospital before being moved to jail, where he was charged with first-degree murder. Authorities ordered the encampment vacated. The group complied after holding a prayer meeting.
In July 2018, Joseph Bryan Capstraw, 20, was arrested in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, after confessing to the murder of a woman he met at a Rainbow Gathering in Lumpkin County, Georgia, the week before. Police say the woman, identified as 18-year-old Amber Robinson of Florida, hitchhiked with Capstraw after leaving the Gathering and was beaten to death by him after an altercation.
In February 2021, Larry ""Frank"" Dugger, who was attending a Rainbow Gathering at the Ocala National Forest, was shot and killed by an unknown assailant.

Gatherings outside the United States
Gatherings are routinely held all over the world, on every continent (excluding Antarctica).

European gatherings
There is an annual European gathering and many European countries host their own national or regional gatherings. The first European Rainbow Gathering was organized in 1983 in Val Campo, Ticino, Switzerland. The 2007 European gathering, the 25th recurrence of that annual event, took place in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The subsequent European Gatherings took place in Serbia (2008), Ukraine (2009) and Finland (2010). In 2010, there were also two Rainbow Gatherings in the Canary Islands, Spain. The first was held near the northern coast of La Palma and the second was held on Gran Canaria. The 2011 Gathering was in Portugal, 2012 in Slovakia, 2013 in Greece, the 2014 gathering in Romania, the 2015 gathering in Lithuania, 2016 in the Alps, 2017 in Italy, 2018 in Poland, 2019 in Sweden. The 2020 European Gathering took place in Estonia. In 2021 the gathering was held in France.
Note that the 2017 gathering in Italy was connected to several typhoid cases in France,  Germany,  and Slovenia.

World gatherings
The vision of the World Rainbow Family was manifested in Salto in 1996 at the European Gathering .The vision is to unite the tribes of Earth in the pursuit of World Peace .  This vision was then carried first to South Africa then to India and finally it was held in 2000 in Australia. World Gatherings have been held in Australia, Zimbabwe, Brazil, Costa Rica, Canada, Turkey, Thailand, China, New Zealand, Argentina, Guatemala, Mexico, Hungary, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Colombia. Approximately 3,000 people attended the 2000 World Gathering in Australia, held on farmland in Boonoo Boonoo State Forest, in northern New South Wales. The 2009 World Gathering was held outside Murchison, New Zealand, 2011 in Argentina, 2012 it began in Brazil, where the gatherers caravaned to Guatemala and completed the second half of the WRG, carrying their vision counsel finally to Palenque, Mexico. In 2013, it was once again held in Canada, on Vancouver Island in the western province of British Columbia. 2014 WRG was in Hungary. 2015 WRG was in Egypt, Sinai. 2016 in Ethiopia. World Rainbow Gathering May 2017 was at Jengglungharjo, Indonesia. 2018 World Rainbow Gathering was in Hualien county in Taiwan. 2019 World Rainbow Gathering was in Chimila, in the Sierra Nevadas of Colombia. The 2020 World Rainbow Gathering was to be in Siberia, Russia, but was postponed to 2021. In 2021 due to travel restrictions upon entering Russia the vision council decided to make it in December in Mexico. The October 2022 World Rainbow Gathering was held in the southwest of Turkey followed by Nepal.  The consensus made at the council was for the 2024 gathering to be held in the Ivory Coast in Africa . 
Intergalactic Gatherings have also been held in Mexico and in Egypt ( the first in Palenque and the last in Al Magroon ( dragon mountain )in 2022 with the where the Mayan calendar was adopted by consensus. . Unofficially it was 10 years after 2012.

The population was 48,422 at the 2020 census, making it the fifth-most populous city in New Mexico. It is home to the New Mexico Military Institute (NMMI), founded in 1891. The city is also the location of an Eastern New Mexico University campus. Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge is located a few miles northeast of the city on the Pecos River. Bottomless Lakes State Park is located 12 miles (19 km) east of Roswell on US 380. Chaves County forms the entirety of the Roswell micropolitan area.
The Roswell incident was named after the town, though the crash site of the alleged UFO was some 75 miles (121 km) north of Roswell and closer to Corona. The investigation and debris recovery was handled by the local Roswell Army Air Field. On the 50th anniversary of the Roswell incident, an annual UFO Festival was started. In the 1930s, Roswell was a site for much of Robert H. Goddard's early rocketry work.

The population was 48,422 at the 2020 census, making it the fifth-most populous city in New Mexico. It is home to the New Mexico Military Institute (NMMI), founded in 1891. The city is also the location of an Eastern New Mexico University campus. Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge is located a few miles northeast of the city on the Pecos River. Bottomless Lakes State Park is located 12 miles (19 km) east of Roswell on US 380. Chaves County forms the entirety of the Roswell micropolitan area.
The Roswell incident was named after the town, though the crash site of the alleged UFO was some 75 miles (121 km) north of Roswell and closer to Corona. The investigation and debris recovery was handled by the local Roswell Army Air Field. On the 50th anniversary of the Roswell incident, an annual UFO Festival was started. In the 1930s, Roswell was a site for much of Robert H. Goddard's early rocketry work. The Roswell Museum and Art Center maintains an exhibit that includes a recreation of Goddard's rocket engine development workshop, and Goddard High School is named after him.

History
The first non-indigenous settlers of the area around Roswell were a group of pioneers from Missouri, who attempted to start a settlement 15 miles (24 km) southwest of what is now Roswell in 1865, but were forced to abandon the site because of a lack of water. It was called Missouri Plaza. It also had many Hispanic people from Lincoln, New Mexico. John Chisum had his famous Jingle Bob Ranch about 5 miles (8 km) from the center of Roswell, at South Spring Acres. At the time, it was the largest ranch in the United States.
Van C. Smith, a businessman from Omaha, Nebraska, and his partner, Aaron Wilburn, constructed two adobe buildings in 1869 that began what is now Roswell. The two buildings became the settlement's general store, post office, and sleeping quarters for paying guests. In 1871, Smith filed a claim with the federal government for the land around the buildings, and on August 20, 1873, he became the town's first postmaster. Smith was the son of Roswell Smith, a prominent lawyer in Lafayette, Indiana, and Annie Ellsworth, daughter of U.S. Patent Commissioner Henry Leavitt Ellsworth. He called the town Roswell, after his father's first name.
In 1877, Captain Joseph Calloway Lea and his family bought out Smith and Wilburn's claim and became the owners of most of the land of Roswell and the area surrounding it. The town was relatively quiet during the Lincoln County War (1877–1879). A major aquifer was discovered when merchant Nathan Jaffa had a well drilled in his back yard on Richardson Avenue in 1890, resulting in the area's first major growth and development spurt. The growth continued when the Pecos Valley Railroad arrived in 1892.
During World War II, a prisoner-of-war camp was located in nearby Orchard Park. The German prisoners of war were used to do major infrastructure work in Roswell, such as paving the banks of the North Spring River. Some POWs used rocks of different sizes to create the outline of an iron cross among the stones covering the north bank. Later, the iron cross was covered with a thin layer of concrete. In the 1980s, a crew cleaning the river bed cleared off the concrete and revealed the outline once more. The small park just south of the cross was then known as Iron Cross Park. On November 11, 1996, the park was renamed POW/MIA Park. The park displays a piece of the Berlin Wall, presented to the city of Roswell by the German Air Force.
Roswell was a location of military importance from 1941 to 1967. In 1967, the Walker Air Force Base was decommissioned. After the closure of the base, Roswell capitalized on its pleasant climate and reinvented itself as a retirement community.
Roswell has benefited from interest in the alleged UFO incident of 1947. It was the report of an object that crashed in the general vicinity in June or July 1947, allegedly an extraterrestrial spacecraft and its alien occupants. Since the late 1970s, the incident has been the subject of intense controversy and of a conspiracy theory regarding a classified program named ""Project Mogul"". Many UFO proponents maintain that an alien craft was found and its occupants were captured, and that the military then engaged in a cover-up. In recent times, the business community has deliberately sought out tourists interested in UFOs, science fiction, and aliens.
Roswell hosted the record-breaking skydive by Felix Baumgartner on October 14, 2012.

Geography
Roswell is located in the High Great Plains of southeastern New Mexico, approximately 7 mi (11 km) west of the Pecos River and some 40 mi (64 km) east of highlands that rise to the Sierra Blanca range. U.S. Routes 70, 285 and 380 intersect in the city. US 70 leads northeast 111 mi (179 km) to Clovis and 117 mi (188 km) west to Alamogordo; US 285 leads north 192 mi (309 km) to Santa Fe and south 76 mi (122 km) to Carlsbad; and US 380 leads east 134 mi (216 km) to Brownfield, Texas, and west 164 mi (264 km) to Socorro.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 29.776 square miles (77.12 km2), of which, 29.716 square miles (76.96 km2) is land and 0.060 square miles (0.16 km2), or 0.18%, is water.

Climate
Roswell is located in both the High Plains and the Chihuahuan Desert and has four very distinct seasons, giving it a cold semi-arid climate (BSk) according to the Köppen climate classification. Winters are cool, but usually sunny, and snowfall can occur. Spring is mild and usually warm, but can still be cold on occasion. Summers are very hot (as is common with the High Plains of New Mexico and Colorado) and averages around 30 days per year when the temperature rises above 100 °F (38 °C), which can be unpleasant. The North American monsoon occurs during the summer, and can bring torrential downpours, severe thunderstorms (with high winds and hail) and sometimes even tornadoes. The rain can provide a cooling relief from the scorching great plains heat. Fall is usually warm and pleasant, but can be cold late in the season. Snow is possible generally from late October to March.
The record low in Roswell is −24 °F (−31 °C) on January 11, 1962, and February 8, 1933. The record high is 114 °F (46 °C) on June 27, 1994.

The Sawdust also hosts an annual Winter Fantasy art fair in mid-November through December, which is open to non-resident exhibitors.

Description
The Sawdust Art Festival is an annual art festival, held in Laguna Beach, California from the end of June to the end of August. There is also a “Sawdust Winter Fantasy” festival, running weekends from mid-November through December, and open to non-resident exhibitors.
As the only non-juried art festival in Laguna, the Sawdust displays paintings, sculpture, printmaking, photography, glass, ceramics, jewelry, woodwork, furniture, textiles, clothing and mixed media. The festival also features glassblowing demonstrations, ceramic center, art workshops, a children's art booth, outdoor cafes, a saloon and a variety of live musical entertainment.
As of 2014, the festival was drawing about 200,000 visitors each year.

History
In 1965, a group of hippie-type artists were dissatisfied with the nearby Laguna Beach Festival of Arts (FOA) and its jury system, which they viewed as rigged and part of The Establishment.  This group held their first exhibit in 1965 on the vacant Peacock lot near Park Avenue in Laguna; it was called ""The Rejects Festival"" by some in the media and at the FOA. The group held their second showing in 1967 on the Kronquist lot in north Laguna.
In 1968, the festival moved to its present three-acre site on Laguna Canyon Road, across the street from the established FOA. At this location, Sawdust artists began building, ""wildly conceived, mostly wood-built quasi-dwellings, which were heavy on the rustic theme, with no two alike."" They also built a wooden, fort-like gate, and spread sawdust or wood chips onto the bare ground.
While the festival in its early days had a carnival atmosphere, with streakers and religious fanatics preaching amid the booths, it was sparsely attended. Admission was initially free; but it was raised to 25 cents in the early 1970s, “only after some locals came to chant and preach rather than look,” according to an early exhibitor. 

Attendance grew and reached a peak of 350,000 in the early 1970s.  By the mid-1980s, the home-made booths, gate, and sawdust remained, but as the festival became more respectable, attendance fell to around 250,000.
In 1985, the Sawdust spent $60,000 for a new front facade, a mock-up of the nearby Hotel Laguna and three other Laguna buildings. Later, Sawdust management erected a permanent, Bavarian style facade.
The Sawdust's “Benevolence Fund,” started in 1987, is a non-profit organization, assisting artists living in Laguna Beach who have, “suffered a catastrophic event, making them unable to work."" This fund holds yearly fundraisers.
By the late 1980s, the Sawdust was becoming a bigger tourist attraction than the Festival of Arts.
By 2003, the festival had acquired professional management, was charging $5.50 for admission, had about 200,000 visitors a season, and new artists were only allowed to exhibit if they were Laguna Beach residents.
By 2015, the Sawdust joined Laguna's other two festivals in offering one admission ticket for all three events. Also, by 2015, several artist/exhibitors have been at the festival since its early days; they include Doug Miller, Nikki Grant, Dion Wright and David Nelson.
2020 & thereafter saw strict measures against the COVID-19 pandemic, including wearing masks and enforcing social distancing.

The newly crowned S.L.U.G. Queen is referred to as the ""Raining"" S.L.U.G. Queen. After a year of ""rain"", the S.L.U.G. Queen is promoted to Old Queen (never former or past).

Coronation
The annual coronation process somewhat resembles a formal beauty pageant, but with a campy spin. The slug-themed pageant started in 1983, and Eugene celebrated the S.L.U.G. Queen coronation's 25th year with a Silver Jubilee in August 2007. The Silver Jubilee Queen was Old Queen Glorious Gastropause, also known as comedian Leigh Anne Jasheway. Slugs are gender neutral, therefore S.L.U.G. Queens may identify as any gender.

History
The S.L.U.G. Queen was first conceived in 1983 as a backlash to the Eugene City Council choosing the characterless name ""Eugene Celebration"" for a citywide festival. After the successful opening of the Hult Center for the Performing Arts in 1982, the city council determined that an annual celebration of art, culture, and commerce in Eugene would be advantageous. Cynthia Wooten, a city councilwoman, was discussing the idea of a uniquely Eugene festival and parade with then-City Manager Mike Gleason. Gleason purportedly wanted to name the city festival simply the ""Eugene Celebration"" according to Wooten.  Wooten, along with Karl Eysenbach and Paul Ollswang, argued for the name ""Slugfest,"" but this was turned down by the rest of the city council.
Alana Probst organized the first Slugfest as an alternative to (and parody of) other cities' beauty pageants in her own backyard where the first S.L.U.G. Queen was elected. The rebel group then entered a parade float shaped like a giant slug in the first Eugene Celebration Parade, with the first S.L.U.G. Queen, a man named Bruce Gordon, riding in drag on it. This movement was in direct opposition to the wishes of the rest of the city council but was instantly popular with the crowds.
The S.L.U.G. Queen Competition and Coronation grew to be an annual event. Rather than perpetuating typical beauty queen standards, the originators chose as their emblem a life form more in keeping with the Pacific Northwest's soggy climate and Eugene's iconoclastic spirit: the humble slug. Since 1991, the S.L.U.G. Queen coronation has been organized by Kim Still, who was the manager of the Eugene Saturday Market.

Selection criteria
The new S.L.U.G. Queen is selected annually on the second Friday evening in August in a three part competition that involves costume judging (based on campy appeal and overall sluggishness), a three-minute on-stage talent performance, and a single question designed to test the quick wit of each contestant. The S.L.U.G. Queen is chosen by a collection of past queens officially referred to as ""old,"" not ""former"" queens, as one of their mottoes is ""once a Queen--always a Queen."" The judges base their assessments on three factors: originality, creativity, and a flamboyant outgoing personality.
One important aspect that sets the S.L.U.G. Queen pageant apart from others is that bribery is accepted and encouraged and the judging is done by a panel of Old Queens. The moment a new queen is crowned, the old queens are open to bribery. Creative bribes curry the most favor with the old queens. They annually remind budding hopefuls to ""Bribe early and bribe often."" Since S.L.U.G. Queens retain the title of queen for life, and the power to crown new queens, they remain a vibrant, visible and vocal part of the community in their royal character. They use this visibility to raise awareness and funds for local causes and charities and host events in character.

SLUG Queen duties
The new S.L.U.G. Queen formerly presided over the parade at the Eugene Celebration, where the queen met the public for her first official duty. In the past she has opened the Mayor's Art Show, the New Zone Gallery's Salon des Refusés (a display of art that was not selected for the Mayor's Art Show), delivers a benediction at the Maude Kerns Art Center Jello Art Show, holds a charitable ball for the charity of her choice, and ""rains"" over the coronation for the following year's S.L.U.G. Queen. She may choose to make other appearances throughout the year including the Oregon Country Fair, ribbon cuttings and openings, fashion shows, and Art and the Vineyard, among others.
The S.L.U.G. Queens pride themselves on representing the diversity of the City of Eugene. Anyone over the age of 21 is electable, provided they are able to impress the Old Queens.
S.L.U.G. queens never lose their prestigious titles. After their ""raining"" year they are promoted to ""Old Queen"" for the next decade, then ""Very Old Queen"", ""Very, Very Old Queen"" and ""Exquisitely Old Queen"" at each subsequent decade.

The neighborhood is home to the Allentown Historic District.","The Allentown district is a neighborhood in Buffalo, New York. The neighborhood is home to the Allentown Historic District.

History
Allentown is named after Lewis F. Allen (1800–1890) who came to Buffalo in April 1827 to serve as Corporate Secretary and financial manager of an insurance company. Allen was also a farmer and when looking for space to let his cattle graze, purportedly his neighbor, Thomas Day, suggested some of his land, which sat between the cities of Buffalo and Black Rock. Allen's cattle path became known as Allen Street. Notably, Allen was one of the founders of the Buffalo Historical Society and Forest Lawn Cemetery, where he is buried. Allen was married to Margaret Cleveland Allen, who was the paternal aunt of future president Grover Cleveland. Allen introduced him to many influential people, including the partners in the law firm of Rogers, Bowen, and Rogers, where Cleveland later took a clerkship, which in turn led him to practice law and enter into politics.

Geography
Allentown is the first neighborhood north of the Downtown Buffalo core. It borders the downtown theater and entertainment district to its south, and runs north to North Street at its northern edge, Normal Avenue on the west, and Main street on the east. The neighborhood is generally centered on Allen Street and Elmwood Avenue.
Allentown is known for its community of artists, for its embrace of bohemian, hipster and gay culture, and for the civic commitment of residents to the historic and aesthetic sensibilities of the neighborhood. Allentown is one of Buffalo's premier areas for nightlife, dining, and antique shopping.

Historic district
The Allentown Historic District is a historic district that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, and expanded in 2012. It includes the Kleinhans Music Hall which is separately listed on the NRHP and is further designated as a National Historic Landmark. Also listed on the NRHP is the Birge-Horton House on Delaware Avenue.
The original 1980 boundaries include approximately 733 buildings, not including secondary structures. Of these, 6 are Gothic Revival, 125 Italianate, 24 Second Empire, 92 Shingle style, 106 Queen Anne, 15 Stick, 5 Shingle, 56 Colonial and 196 are plain framed buildings.
Three park areas are included in the area, two redesigned by Frederick Law Olmsted and one circle, Symphony Circle, designed by him as part of his master plan for the city's park areas. After he completed the master plan, Olmsted returned to redesign and landscape Day's Park (named after Allen's neighbor Thomas Day who donated his land to the City of Buffalo) and Arlington Park; two existing city parks. In Day's Park he added a circular walkway in front of the school so the students would not trample the grass. The circular sandstone planting area that was in the center of the walkway is still in existence. Arlington Park was home to Frank Lloyd Wright while he worked in Buffalo.
The new boundaries added about 320 properties to the list.

Allentown Art Festival
The Allentown Art Festival, originally known as the Buffalo Art Festival, is an event started by Jason Natowitz in 1958, beginning as a small town meeting to stimulate business in the neighborhood. The meeting triggered the foundation of the Allentown Village Society, and, by August, plans were in the works for an outdoor art show in the town, which occurred the following month in September 1958. With only 50 artists, the event quickly became very successful. Louis Cherenzia, another one of the founders, noted ""It was rated as the most colorful cultural event in Buffalo since the Pan-American Exposition."" Following the event, the town recognized its success, and announced plans for a second annual.
""The Buffalo Art Festival"" quickly came to be identified with its more precise location, Allentown, and eventually its name became ""Allentown Art Festival"".
The Allentown Art Festival has grown since its beginnings 50 years ago. Support of the Allentown Village Society, Inc. and its number of volunteers has essentially stayed the same. According to the official website, ""Their labors have borne fruit beyond the annual Allentown Art Festival weekend and beyond the boundaries of the Allentown neighborhood of Buffalo.""

History
The festival began in 1962 in front of the Pletcher Furniture Village in downtown Nappanee as part of a sidewalk days celebration. Watercolors painted by local students in the park department's summer arts program were hung on clotheslines between the pillars of the store. The event quickly grew to include artists and craftsmen displaying and selling their wares in booths. The event soon spread to several blocks and alleys surrounding the furniture store. Visitors soon demanded Amish-related products including smoked hams, jams, jellies, and baked goods. A converted school bus was used to tour the surrounding countryside. The Pletcher family founded Amish Acres in 1968 partly from this market study in miniature. The festival was moved to the historic farm in 1971 and rapidly expanded to surround the farm's pond.
Due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, 2020 saw no concerts nor shows due to COVID-19. Since that year, strict measures are undertaken, such as wearing masks and social distancing.

The three official fairs are The Ann Arbor Street Art Fair, the Original; the State Street Art Fair; and the Ann Arbor Summer Art Fair. In addition to art exhibits, the fairs feature music performances, demonstrations, merchant marketplace, and interactive art activities.

The fairs
Ann Arbor Street Art Fair, The Original
The oldest of the three, the Ann Arbor Street Art Fair, The Original, was established in 1960 by a collaboration between the South University Businessmen's Association, Ann Arbor Art Association, and the Chamber of Commerce. Originally the Art Association did not believe artist would want their work to be displayed in the street stating, “No good artist will sit in the street.” That proved not to be true. The first fair attracted only 132 artists, 99 of them being local, by the third annual fair there were 220 artists.

Ann Arbor State Street Art Fair
The State Street Area Art Fair, originating in 1968, holds a special place in the Ann Arbor Art Fair tradition with Bargain Days roots, a merchant event preceding the Ann Arbor Art Fair by 32 years. It is supported by the State Street Area Association (DBA State Street District) in collaboration with local businesses. The fair has maintained its commitment to community development and artist opportunities expanded over time. Its unique funding model, where 100% of the State Street Area Art Fair revenue is invested in arts & culture, local businesses, and community events, reflects the fair's dedication to its founding principles.

Ann Arbor Summer Art Fair
The Ann Arbor Summer Art Fair takes place in two locations, State Street from Madison to William, and along Main Street and Liberty to Fifth Avenue. Produced by The Guild of Artists & Artisans, a non-profit artist membership organization, it features 375 jury selected artists.
It all began in the spring of 1970, about ten years following the premiere of the original Ann Arbor Street Fair. A group of young artists from Ann Arbor began working on a separate art fair which would give emerging artists, craftspeople and art students a chance to “take to the streets.” Calling it the Free Arts Festival, they set up this “free fair” on the University of Michigan's “Diag” on Central Campus. Funding and management for this new fair was provided by the participating artists themselves. Later in the mid-70s the event was renamed the Ann Arbor Summer Art Fair.

Ann Arbor South University Art Fair
The Ann Arbor South University Art Fair is nationally recognized as a fine arts and crafts fair.

Art Fair Food
The usual fair food is offered such as French fries, cotton candy, funnel fries, caramel apples and fried Twinkies. However community businesses and local vendors offer a variety of specialized cuisine from restaurants across the city in the street and with grab & go food.

Protest from residents
Given the traffic disruption and the inconvenience of having a large number of visitors come in for the week, many Ann Arbor residents dislike the fairs and have protested against them, rallying under the slogan of ""It's not art, and it's not fair."" In 2005, in an effort to cultivate a better relationship with locals the fairs started a tradition of holding a ""Townie Street Party"" before the fairs begin expanded to all Fairs activating a community event prior to the Ann Arbor Art Fair event date. The First Townie Party was planned and supported by all four fairs.

The festival is held in Memorial Park in the spring and in Downtown Houston in the fall.
The Art Colony Association originated in 1971, when it was known as the Westheimer Colony Association. A collective effort of Lower Westheimer businesses formed an arts & crafts gathering as part of a beautification of the neighborhood, where the Westheimer Colony Art Festival was born. The art festival included a juried art exhibit featuring works from artists both local and national, and the proceeds from the art exhibit benefited Houston-based charities, community organizations and arts groups, such as the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts.
Shortly after the art festival began, a collective street fair evolved around its grounds which would later become the Westheimer Street Festival. By the late 1980s, the Westheimer Art Festival began to distance itself from the growing street festival, eventually resulting in a legal dispute in 1992 between the Westheimer Colony Association and the organizers of the street festival over the rights of The Original Westheimer Street Fest Inc. and the community organizers to charge an admission fee.
In 1993, the Westheimer Art Festival moved from its Montrose/Neartown venue on Westheimer Road to a Downtown location on Main Street and Calhoun.

Trivia
At the crossroads where Westheimer becomes Elgin in Midtown Houston, there is a small plaza where northbound Spur 527 becomes Brazos Street. Sandwiched between Brazos and Bagby, the plaza is known as the Westheimer Colony Plaza.
To Houstonians, the Bayou City Art Festival (which had its origins as the Westheimer Colony Art Festival) has grown out of its Neartown roots to become a citywide gathering.
Since 2005, Sam Houston Park was the venue of the fall festival due to the reconstruction of Smith Street.
In June 2005, a revival of the former Westheimer Colony Art Festival took place during Gay Pride Weekend. The revived art gathering was known as the Westheimer Arts Festival. The pluralization of the word ""arts"" came from the informal name given to the Westheimer Colony Art Festival by festivalgoers—the Westheimer Arts Festival has no relationship with the Bayou City Art Festival promoters or Art Colony Association. This also holds true for the latest incarnation of the former Westheimer Street Festival initially as WestFest Compressed, which evolved into the Westheimer Block Party.

History
Colorfest began in 1963 as a nature walk, but would eventually become a juried arts and crafts festival.  The walk was originally organized by either Duncan Burchard, a local naturalist,  or John Brown, another Thurmont local.   Between 1968 and 1971 the other festivities were added to the walk, which now drew in 30,000 people.  In the year 1973 craftspeople, who set up their stands at the carnival grounds and in the community park, were invited to the festival for the first time.  The 1973 event was planned by the Catoctin Mountain Tourist Council with the help of volunteers.  In 1974 officers were elected for the first time to organise Colorfest.  By 1975 the event was drawing in over 75,000 people.  The year 1976 was notable for a bad flood on Saturday, which according to American Towns, almost ruined the event.  The rain stopped on Sunday and the event was a success in the end.
In 1979 Beverly Zienda was elected president of the Colorfest, a job she would hold for 29 years until her death in 2008 when she died from breast cancer.  Her husband is quoted as saying that, ""she was practically running that Colorfest from her hospital bed.""   In November 1977 Colorfest held their inaugural Catoctin Colorfest dinner meeting.  In 1980 craftspeople were invited to set up their stands in the area in front of Thurmont Middle School.  By 1988 over 350 vendors participated in Colorfest.  In 2008 the festival began to offer recycling bins for the first time.  As of 2013 the president of the Colorfest committee is Carol Robertson who took up the position after Beverly Zienda's death.
2020 saw the COVID-19 pandemic as grounds for cancellation. The 58th was deferred to 2021.

Fundraising
In 1983 Colorfest became successful enough that the Colorfest committee turned a profit.  Every year since then they have donated the proceeds of the event to local organisations.  Much of the money raised from parking and vendor fees is used to support local scholarships and projects with over $140,000 having been given out in Scholarships to graduates of Catoctin High School.  Colorfest weekend is one of the biggest fundraising weekend for many charities in the area.  Colorfest Inc. regularly donates to the local Guardian Hose Fire Company, Frederick County Public Libraries, and the Frederick Food Bank.  The Frederick Food Bank received $13,000 from Colorfest Inc. between 2011 and 2013.  A number of churches, along with the Thurmont Community Ambulance Company, consider Colorfest to be their biggest fundraiser of the year.

Penn State students and locals commonly refer to the event as Arts Fest.

History
The first Central Pennsylvania Festival of the Arts was held in July 1967, and lasted nine days. Sponsored by Penn State's College of Arts and Architecture and the State College Chamber of Commerce, the first Festival was opened by Governor Raymond P. Shafer. Musical performances took place downtown and on campus, and the first Sidewalk Sale and Exhibition consisted of people hanging work on snow fence along ""The Wall"" on the southern border of the Old Main lawn. The show wasn't originally juried, so one could purchase art created by professionals and amateurs. Patrons could even buy kittens.
The festival is now five days long, from Wednesday through Sunday in early July each year, and the Sidewalk Sale and Exhibition is now professionally juried. A large portion of the event takes place in the Borough of State College, PA, and the remainder on the adjacent University Park campus of The Pennsylvania State University.
The Central Pennsylvania Festival of the Arts placed at number five on the list of Top 10 Summer Festivals 2013 by Livability.com, a national website that ranks quality of life and travel amenities of America's small and mid-sized cities.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the event was forced to go virtual in 2020 and 2021.

Governance and Mission
The festival is governed by a Board of Directors, half of whom must have an affiliation with Penn State (""gown""), while the other half represents the ""town"" interests. The Board employs a staff of three to manage both the Central Pennsylvania  Festival of the Arts and First Night State College. The board established the mission of the festival which is to “celebrate the arts with presentations of diverse, high-quality visual and performing arts through the cooperative volunteer support of the community and The Pennsylvania State University. The essence of this organization is the enrichment and education of the audience, grounded in personal interaction between artist and audience.""
Approximately 400 volunteers help bring the Festival to life each summer.

Children and Youth Day
The first day of the Festival is always Children and Youth Day. It features the Children and Youth Sidewalk Sale, free children's art and craft workshops, and performances by and for young people on two outdoor and one indoor stage.

Sidewalk Sale and Exhibition
Consistently ranked as one of the top outdoor fine art and fine craft shows in the nation, the Sidewalk Sale and Exhibition brings artists and craftspeople from across the nation to State College. More than three hundred exhibitors offer a wide variety of objects for sale including baskets, ceramics, jewelry, fiber, painting, photography, and wearable art.
As part of the Sidewalk Sale and Exhibition's jury process,  artists from the United States and several foreign countries submit digital images of their work to be juried. Each February, a panel reviews the images and the artists receiving the highest scores were accepted into the Sidewalk Sale & Exhibition.
To encourage and support the visual arts on a regional basis, the Sidewalk Sale and Exhibition sets aside booth spaces for artists whose primary residence is in the following Central Pennsylvania counties: Blair, Centre, Clearfield, Clinton, Huntingdon, Mifflin and Union. Though the Central Pennsylvania Division of the Sidewalk Sale, many artists have been introduced to exhibiting at juried outdoor shows. All exhibitors in the Sidewalk Sale and Exhibition are subject to the same rules, pay the same fees, and are eligible for the same awards.
Sidewalk Sale and Exhibition exhibitors are eligible to receive over $17,000 in prize money.
The Sidewalk Sale and Exhibition of the Central Pennsylvania Festival of the Arts recently ranked second on the list of 100 Best Fine Art and Design Shows in America, up from a ranking of third, which it held for the last two years. The twentieth annual poll, published in the September 2012 issue of Sunshine Artist, is based on sales totals reported by exhibitors at the 2011 festival.  Sunshine Artist magazine is America's premier show and festival guide.

Performing arts
In addition to the Sidewalk Sale and Exhibition, the Festival presents performers on outdoor and indoor stages in downtown State College and on the Penn State campus. Currently the Festival presents indoors in St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, State College Presbyterian Church, and the State Theatre in downtown State College. The Festival also erects outdoor stages on the 100 block of South Allen Street, and on the lawn of Old Main, Penn State's administration building. Each July, about fifty different performers are presented. Most performances are free, some require a Festival button for admission. Music presented covers a wide range of genres, from classical to rock to bluegrass to jazz to symphonic band. Performers are of international, national, state, and regional standing.

Images Exhibition
Images is the Festival's juried gallery exhibition in the Robeson Gallery on the University Park campus of Penn State and hangs from June through July each year. It is open to artists living in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia and the District of Columbia.

Through the years the exhibition has been juried by curators and directors from the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Carnegie Museum of Art, the Albright-Knox Gallery, and major university galleries, including Penn State's own, Palmer Museum of Art.

Posters
Arts festivals across the country often advertise themselves with collectible posters. For the past 30 years this Festival's posters have been designed Penn State Professor of Visual Arts Lanny Sommese, and many are locally iconic images in the community.

The Sue Crowe Memorial Annual Arts Festival Races
The Arts Festival 10K is the oldest race in Central Pennsylvania. First run in 1975 as a 10 Miler, the Arts Festival race became a 10K race in the late 1980s. The course has gone through numerous changes over the years. In 2005, a 5K race was added and a new course created that combines East and West Campuses.  Proceeds benefit youth running activities in Centre County and the continuing operations of the Nittany Valley Running Club.
In 2006, the Arts Festival races were renamed in honor of Sue Crowe, who died in February 2006. Crowe was a Central Pennsylvania running community fixture who also coached upcoming competitors. She and her family competed in most of the Arts Festival races, and she was a five-time winner: three times while the race was a 10-miler and two times after it became a 10K race. The race currently honors her memory.

Many events are held in Market Square in downtown Knoxville. Additionally, driving trails are marked in Knoxville and the surrounding area for people to view the dogwoods in bloom.

History
The initial impetus for the dogwood festival came from a description of Knoxville by John Gunther in his 1947 book Inside U.S.A. In that best-selling book, Gunther characterized Knoxville as the ""ugliest city"" in the United States, with what he called ""an intense, concentrated, degrading ugliness."" Other visitors to the city had also commented negatively on the city's appearance. In reaction to the insulting characterization of the city, Knoxville civic leaders started a community beautification campaign. Beautification efforts began with yard and neighborhood cleanups. In 1955, the first dogwood trail was designated in Sequoyah Hills. A second trail followed in Holston Hills in 1956, and additional trails were designated in 1957 in Fountain City and the Lake Forest neighborhood. In 1959, Knoxville News Sentinel columnist Carson Brewer proposed a dogwood festival, pointing to the successful ramp festival in Cosby, Tennessee, as a model for the potential success of a festival in Knoxville. The city's chamber of commerce and Junior League embraced the idea and contributed $20,000 each to make it a reality, leading to the first annual festival in 1961.
In 1995, journalist Paul Harvey praised the city's beauty during the festival, saying ""there’s something about Knoxville that makes dogwood trees grow taller"" and describing the dogwoods lining residential streets as ""resplendent by day and moonlighted by night."" Calling the city ""a springtime blizzard of blossoms of dogwood"", he noted the presence of other flowers, including violets, iris, May apples, lilacs, narcissus, and flowering fruit trees. He said that the festival attracted a quarter-million visitors each year.
In 2020, the event went virtual for the first time in its 66-year history, as the COVID-19 pandemic concerns caused cancellation of most art events.

History
Festival was first held in 1970, inspired by the installation of Alexander Calder's La Grande Vitesse previous year, featuring two stages and a few food booths. The event grew quickly, filling the Vandenberg Plaza by the 1980s, and subsequently expanding into nearby streets, with several performance stages, and more than two dozen food booths. The public event was temporarily suspended in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, replaced with a virtual event. Festival returned to a free, public live event by 2021.
In 2022, one person was killed and three others injured in an early morning shooting at Festival.
On February 8, 2025, the event's organizers announced in a Facebook post that the Festival would cease operations. The Festival had run for 55 years.

It is one of the oldest and largest local festivals in California. Proceeds go to local civic causes and to the beautification of the downtown area of Half Moon Bay. There is no admission charge for the event.

Dates
The annual event is held in October. Columbus Day Monday is the Safeway World Champion Pumpkin Weigh-in contest. The Half Moon Bay Art and Pumpkin Festival is a two-day event held the following Saturday and Sunday, from 1971 to 2019, and since 2022.
The COVID-19 pandemic caused the festival to be canceled in 2020; the 50th was deferred to 2021. In 2021 the festival was again canceled, although there was a pumpkin weigh-off.

Locations
The festival is located in downtown Half Moon Bay on Main Street between Miramontes and Spruce Streets. The Great Pumpkin Parade is held at noon on Saturday and runs east along Miramontes, North on Main St, and West on Mill Street. There are two music stages, one at the south entrance and one located next to the food court in the IDES grounds. A family stage is located at 620 Main Street. The associated Safeway World Championship Pumpkin Weigh-In is located on the IDES Grounds at 735 Main Street on Columbus Day, the Monday prior to the festival.

History
The Half Moon Bay Art and Pumpkin Festival began in 1971 with the formation of the Main Street Beautification Committee. The group was formed to raise funds for the revitalization of Main Street, which was beginning to show signs of decay. With an abundance of pumpkin patches in the area, the committee organized an old-fashioned harvest-style pumpkin festival. The first festival attracted 30,000 people. That year only one non-profit organization offered food for sale. The festival now includes dozens of local non-profit groups operating food and game booths, selling everything from pumpkin pie to linguisa sandwiches. Proceeds go to various civic and local causes and have included the construction of two parks, multiple scholarship funds, the installation of old-fashioned downtown street lights, the underground wiring of Main Street, and the renovation of City Hall.

Traditions
The Safeway World Championship Pumpkin Weigh-Off attracts growers from around the United States. The weigh-off is held the Monday prior to the festival and the winners are on display during the festival weekend. In 2019 the Weigh-Off was awarded the Great Pumpkin Commonwealth's ""World's Top Weigh-Off Site"" award for having the ten heaviest pumpkins among the 114 GPC-sanctioned weigh-off sites worldwide. The heaviest pumpkin ever to win the contest was the champion in 2023, which weighed 2,749 pounds (1,247 kg).

Harvest inspired Arts and Crafts are represented by 250 artists and craftmakers. Original works are available in glass, ceramics, metals, fiber, leather, wood, jewelry and fine art.
Food is a big item at the festival. Many food offerings include pumpkin such as pie, pancakes, bread, cheesecake, sausages, and ice cream. Local coastal favorites include Brussels sprouts, artichoke hearts, and Portuguese linguisa sandwiches. All food is provided by community non-profit groups.
The Great Pumpkin Parade features the weigh-off champion pumpkin, marching bands, classic cars, and costumed children of all ages.
Continuous entertainment is located on three stages throughout the festival. A variety of music is available from Country, to Blues, to Reggae.
Family entertainment includes a costume contest, pumpkin carving, games, and a pie eating contest.
Giant pumpkin carving is provided by Farmer Mike, a professional pumpkin carver that turns giant pumpkins (up to a thousand pounds) into faces and reliefs. Farmer Mike has carved at the event for 39 years.
Local wine and microbrews offer wine and beer by the glass.
Other attractions include a Sunday Pumpkin Run/Walk, a talent show, a pancake breakfast, giant pumpkin photos, a poster contest exhibit, and a haunted house.

Traffic
The popular event attracts more than 200,000 people to this rural community. Major access from the greater San Francisco Bay Area is from Highway 92 to the east. North/South access from San Francisco or Santa Cruz is available using coastal Highway 1. The festival, combined with multiple pumpkin patches surrounding the town, generate severe traffic congestion each year. Parking is limited to side streets or paid parking in lots sponsored by local organizations.

Occurring twice a year since 1995, the festival includes international and local music, handcrafts, dancing, cuisine, children's activities, outdoor adventures, drum circles, a zipline, and canoeing.

History
When LEAF was created in 1995, it was an acronym for ""Lake Eden Arts Festival"". As of 2012, the original name is only used as a historical reference - it has transformed into LEAF Community Arts often referred to as ""LEAF"". LEAF has several signature programs including: LEAF Festival, LEAF Schools & Streets, LEAF International, LEAF Downtown AVL, and LEAF Local.

History of the venue
The home of LEAF, Lake Eden Events & Camp Rockmont for Boys, was the site of the historic Black Mountain College (BMC). Many of the century's most celebrated artists and thinkers attended the college as teachers or students: Albert Einstein, Robert Rauschenberg, Anni Albers, Merce Cunningham, Rothko and Buckminster Fuller (who designed the first geodesic dome there). Prior to BMC, in the early 1900s, Edwin Wiley Grove (of the Grove Park Inn and Grove Arcade) developed the land and constructed some buildings with his trademark native stone fireplaces. Prior to Grove, The Lake Eden Inn and Resort offered a getaway for people seeking its healing waters and rejuvenating air.

Outreach
LEAF in Schools & Streets is a non-profit collaborative outreach program bringing performing artists into schools and community centers for hands-on workshops, residencies, and interactive performances. The experience provides opportunities for youth to perform alongside resident artists on a national stage, with family members in the audience.

History
Founder of Portland Brewing Co, Art Larrance, launched the Oregon Brewers Festival in July 1988, after visiting Oktoberfest in Munich and wanting to create a similar atmosphere and experience. 

Live music was introduced in 2001. 
In 2005, OBF expanded from a three-day schedule (Friday to Sunday) to four, adding Thursday. 
The 2011 Oregon Brewers Festival featured 85 craft beers from 14 states; it attracted 80,000 people over four days. Nearly 2,000 volunteers worked at the festival, selling tokens and pouring beer, among other tasks. 
In 2013, OBF added a fifth day, moving the opening to Wednesday; they also replaced the annual plastic mug, which had been used since the festival's beginning, with a tasting glass, which for 2013 costs $7. For 2014, there are 88 beers available, in 30 styles; that does not include the more than 100 available separately in OBF's Specialty Tent.
After two years with tasting glasses made of glass, for 2015, OBF switched to a polycarbonate tasting glass; the change was in response to safety concerns raised by the Portland Police.
In 2018, OBF changed back to a four-day festival, moving the opening to Thursday. That same year, the festival added two hard ciders to the lineup, and four wines –– 2 red and 2 white –– for the first time in the festival's history.
In 2020 and 2021, the festival went on hiatus caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; although it resumed in 2022, it was cancelled in 2023.

Related events
In recent years OBF has anchored a month of beer-related festivals in Portland, including the North American Organic Brewers Festival, the Portland International Beerfest, and the Great American Distillers Festival.

Activities at the festival range from sandcastle making to concerts and laser light shows on the beach.

History
In 1999, a Caseville locals Arlene Nance and Lyn Bezemek came up with an idea for an end-of-summer festival that is now known as Cheeseburger in Caseville. About 5,000 people from around Huron County, Michigan attended the first Cheeseburger festival. What  started as a three-day weekend has turned into a 10-day festival that includes concerts, the highlight of the festival, The Parade of Tropical Fools.
In 2004, five years after the debut of the festival, Caseville Chamber of Commerce president Steve Louwers took control. He continues to be instrumental in the success of Caseville's busiest 10 days.
With 2020 being cancelled caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the 22nd was deferred to 2021.
On Sunday, August 18 2024, competitive eating duo, Alex and Travis, better known as T&A, broke the long standing record of 18 burgers consumed during a single festival. On this historic day Alex broke the record with his 19th burger and Travis tying the previous record with his 18th. Together they put down 37 cheeseburgers. A bronze plaque is expected to be revealed winter 2025 in the town center to commemorate this historic event.

Parade of Tropical Fools
The parade is held on the first Wednesday night of the festival and is the biggest attraction that the festival has to offer.  The parade can last up to two hours and attracts more than 100,000 people every year. Fans of the parade are allowed to start setting up their lawn chairs at 6 a.m. the morning of the parade.
. Thousands of beads, candies, Frisbees, and other miscellaneous objects are thrown from the floats each year.

Description
Parade of Pirates
The theme and focal point of Gasparilla is a theatrical invasion by mythical pirate José Gaspar and his crew, who are portrayed by members of Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla (YMKG), an organization created for this purpose in 1904. Around noon on Gasparilla Day, members of YMKG set sail across Tampa Bay from the Tampa Yacht Club near Ballast Point Park on the Jose Gasparilla II, a replica pirate ship built from a flat-bottomed steel barge. Firing a near-continuous barrage of loud mini-cannons and accompanied by hundreds of private boats, the ship makes its way between Davis Island and Harbour Island to the Garrison Channel, where it moors along the Riverwalk behind the Tampa Convention Center. The krewe disembarks into a crowd of revelers and the pirate captain demands that the mayor hand over the key to the city in a playful ceremony which has had different outcomes in different years. Whether or not the mayor actually ""surrenders"", the pirates stage a victory parade along Bayshore Boulevard.
During the parade, members of Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla along with about fifty other krewes throw beads, coins, and various souvenirs to the throngs from over 100 floats, most of them pirate-themed. In addition to the krewes, high school and university marching bands and drill teams often participate, and many local businesses and organizations build and enter their own elaborate floats from which they also throw trinkets to the crowd. The parade has been broadcast live on local television for decades: WFLA-TV has provided coverage since 1955, and WTVT-TV also covered the parade from 1955 to 1980.

Krewes
Many of the events of Tampa's Gasparilla season are organized by social and charitable organizations known as krewes, which were originally modeled on the Mardi Gras krewes of New Orleans. Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla came together informally in 1904 to stage a mock invasion during a community festival. The organization has continued to stage the Gasparilla Parade ever since and has evolved into an exclusive social club and registered non-profit. As the festivities have become larger and more complicated over the years, YMKG has accepted corporate sponsorships to defray costs and has employed local firm EventFest to plan the parade with the city. Each year, YMKG members elect a King and Queen of Gasparilla to preside over various club galas and events during the season. Besides the Gasparilla parades and holding its own private events, YMKG raises money for various charitable causes and annually endows several college scholarships through its community fund.
The Krewe of Gasparilla was Tampa's only officially recognized Gasparilla krewe until the co-ed Krewe of Venus was organized in 1965. This was followed by the Ybor City–based Krewe of the Knights of Sant' Yago in 1972 and the Tampa Rough Riders in 1978. The  first all-female Ye Loyal Krewe of Grace O'Malley joined in 1992. More krewes were established after YMKG opened up participation in the parade in the 1990s. Krewes are centered around various ethnic, cultural, and historical themes or favorite charity causes, and much like the krewes of Mardi Gras, members often spend a great deal of money on elaborate costumes, beads, and floats.
Currently, over fifty krewes march in the Gasparilla Parade of Pirates, with smaller krewes participating on a rotating basis due to the limited number of available slots. Many of the same krewes—large and small—also participate in the Gasparilla Children's Parade and the Sant' Yago Knight Parade.

Floats
Parade floats have long been a part of Gasparilla festivities. The earliest examples were decorated wagons or flatbeds pulled by horses or trucks, or simply a decorated truck by itself. More involved designs became more common after World War I, and by the 1950s, several multi-segmented floats with elaborate decorations rolled down Bayshore Boulevard on Gasparilla Day.
As of 2024, 115 floats participated in the Parade of Pirates; 14 used by YMKG and the rest by other krewes, local businesses, civic organizations, and sports teams. Some remain relatively simple in design, but a trend in recent years has been to build more elaborate floats with lights, moving animatronic elements, water or smoke effects, and hidden wet bars and bathrooms for riders, with some costing as much as $100,000 to design and construct. Outside of Gasparilla season, YMKG's active and retired floats along with the floats of several other krewes and organizations are stored in the ""float barn"", a warehouse procured by YMKG for that purpose.

Throws and cannons
Parade participants on floats and on foot have traditionally tossed souvenirs as they make their way along the route, but the specific items have changed over time. Plastic beads like those at New Orleans Mardi Gras festivities are by far the most prevalent item, with varieties ranging from simple single-color necklaces to intricate and expensive designs, most of which are purchased by krewe members themselves. So many beads are thrown that in recent years, the city has organized post-parade volunteer cleanup efforts which annually collect thousands of pounds of plastic from the parade route and nearby Tampa Bay.
Though very popular now, beads were rarely seen at Gasparilla Parades before the mid-1980s. The two most common throws before that were plastic or metal commemorative coins produced annually by various krewes and spent gun cartridges. For decades, many members of YMKG walked the parade route armed with six-shooters or other handguns loaded with blanks which they frequently fired in the air. The empty shells were tossed aside as the pirate reloaded, sending children scrambling for the unique souvenirs. This tradition was restricted in the interest of safety in 1992 and ended entirely several years later. While pirates on foot are no longer allowed to use firearms during the parade, trained members of YMKG still fire loud mini-cannons from several specialized floats and during the cross-bay voyage of the Jose Gasparilla II.

Prelude and departure
Several semi-theatrical events take place before and after the Gasparilla Day pirate invasion:

About two weeks before the Parade of Pirates, a U.S. Navy ship volunteers to be attacked by several small boats of the ""Ybor City Navy"" armed with stale loaves of Cuban bread and water hoses. The U.S. Navy returns fire with their water hoses and (on occasion) rotten vegetables, but they are eventually forced to surrender to the Alcalde of Ybor City, who, as the story goes, has been hired by José Gaspar to help clear resistance to his impending pirate attack. The event was staged on an annual basis beginning in the early 1950s but was discontinued after the September 11, 2001 attacks. It has taken place intermittently since then, with the museum ship SS American Victory standing in for the U.S. Navy.
A few days before the Parade of Pirates, members of Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla in full pirate regalia ""kidnap"" the mayor from city hall and transport them to a downtown park before assembled local media and onlookers to demand the city's surrender. The mayor playfully refuses, and the pirates warn that José Gaspar will arrive with an invasion force on the following Saturday to steal the key to the city.
The Outbound Voyage is the culminating event of the Gasparilla season which was revived in 2008 after being discontinued in 1964. During this ceremony, the pirates return the key of the city to the mayor, climb aboard the Jose Gasparilla II, and retrace their route from Gasparilla Day by sailing away across Tampa Bay while festivities continue along the Tampa Riverwalk. The Outbound Voyage usually takes place on the first Saturday in March.

Children's Parade
The Children's Gasparilla Extravaganza is held on the Saturday prior to the main parade, currently the second-to-last Saturday in January. It is billed as a family-friendly event, as unlike the Parade of Pirates, alcohol is not allowed along the parade route, which runs along Bayshore Boulevard and is about half as long as the main Gasparilla Parade. The Children's Parade was first held in 1947 and was a simple affair that mostly featured schools and children's organizations pulling homemade floats for a few blocks in downtown Tampa, though it slowly increased in complexity and popularity over the decades. It moved to its current route in 2002 and usually draws about 100,000 attendees.
The Children's Parade now features many of the same krewes and several of the same professional floats featured in the main parade. Children of krewe members don costumes and ride on the floats tossing beads and trinkets to the crowd, and local youth organizations such as sports and dance teams also participate, usually performing along the route. Various activities and events for children are held in and around downtown Tampa in the hours before the Children's Parade, including the Preschooler's Stroll, which is a short, informal parade of small children riding pirate-themed wagons, strollers, bicycles, and scooters reminiscent of the earliest versions of the children's parade. To add noise to the festivities, the pirate ship Jose Gasparilla usually sails nearby firing its mini-cannons during the parade, and the day ends with a fireworks display over Tampa Bay.

Sant' Yago Illuminated Knight Parade
The Sant' Yago Illuminated Knight Parade (sometimes referred to as the Gasparilla night parade) has been organized since 1974 by the Krewe of the Knights of Sant' Yago. It is held in the historical neighborhood of Ybor City on a Saturday night, usually two weeks after the Parade of Pirates in early to mid-February. The Knight Parade features a similar mix of participants as the Parade of Pirates with the twist that most of the floats are brightly illuminated since the event begins after dark. Though it once had the reputation of being the most adult-oriented parade of Tampa's Gasparilla season, the city has tried to reduce public drunkenness and other unruly behavior in recent years and has promoted the parade as a family-friendly event, with some success.

Additional events of Gasparilla Season
Besides the three main parades and the many galas, parties, and fundraisers hosted by individual krewes, Tampa has long hosted a variety of other Gasparilla-related events from approximately January through March. Large-scale events during Gasparilla Season include the Gasparilla Festival of the Arts (established 1970), the Tampa Rough Rider's St. Patrick's Day Parade (first held in 1977), the Gasparilla Distance Classic road race (established 1978), the Gasparilla Film Festival (established 2006), the Gasparilla Music Festival (established 2013), and the Gasparilla Bowl college football game (renamed in 2018) along with a variety of other events that change from year to year.
One of the first related events was the Gasparilla Open, a PGA Tour stop sponsored by Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla from 1932 to 1935. The 1935 edition had the largest prize purse on that year's PGA Tour ($4000), but with the deepening of the Great Depression, the tournament was discontinued thereafter. It returned in 1956 as the Gasparilla Invitational Tournament, an amateur competition which has been held annually ever since.

Use of the name ""Gasparilla""
A wide variety of local businesses, organizations, and smaller events ranging from restaurants to beauty pageants to classic car shows and food festivals use the names ""Gaspar"" or ""Gasparilla""; according to the Florida Department of State, over 100 entities have registered related names. Other local organizations have taken on the Gasparilla / pirate theme, most prominently the National Football League's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who first took the field in 1976 and installed a replica pirate ship in the stands of their home field at Raymond James Stadium.
Most of the organizations, events, and businesses who use ""Gaspar"" or ""Gasparilla"" are not affiliated with Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla or the City of Tampa, neither of which owns the monikers. While some feel that the widespread use of the name constitutes a co-branding which promotes all similarly named organizations and Tampa in general, others believe that overuse could dilute the meaning and significance of the festival, and that the potential failures or missteps of one event or organization might reflect poorly on all the others. In 2019, YMKG began an effort to legally trademark the name Gasparilla to ""protect"" it for use by ""appropriate community events"", drawing complaints and counterclaims from others who have used the name or own the trademark for other, more narrow uses. In 2020, the issue was considered by the United States Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.

Economic impact
Crowd size for the Parade of Pirates is typically about 300,000, making it one of the largest annual parades in the United States. Most of the expense is paid by YMKG through memberships dues, vendor fees, tickets for premium seating areas, and corporate sponsorships, with the city redeploying police and other staff and resources to limit its financial contribution.
According to a 2004 study, the main parade alone had a local economic impact of $22 million and the combined events brought in over $40 million, with officials estimating that the impact has increased in the years since. To promote the area's many springtime events, Visit Tampa Bay, the local tourist bureau, has run multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns across the United States, Canada, and Europe encouraging visitors to experience ""Gasparilla Season"".

History
Legend of José Gaspar
The theme of Gasparilla was inspired by the legend of the pirate José Gaspar, who supposedly operated off the west coast of Spanish Florida from the 1780s through the 1820s. Different versions of the story say that he was either a Spanish nobleman and advisor to King Charles III of Spain, who was exiled after a romantic scandal in court, a traitorous admiral of the Spanish Royal Navy, who stole a ship and fled when his treachery was revealed, or an ambitious young officer in the Spanish navy who was driven to mutiny by a tyrannically cruel captain. Whatever his origins, the legends agree that Gaspar fled to the virtually uninhabited southwestern coast of Spanish Florida in the 1780s and established his ""pirate kingdom"" on Gasparilla Island in Charlotte Harbor, south of Tampa Bay. Gaspar is said to have taken many ships and held many female hostages for ransom while preying on ships in the Gulf of Mexico from Louisiana to the Spanish main aboard his flagship, the Floriblanca. His exploits came to a sudden end in 1821 when, to avoid being captured by the U.S. Navy pirate hunting schooner the USS Enterprise, he wrapped himself in anchor chains and threw himself overboard while shouting, ""Gasparilla dies by his own hand, not the enemy's!""
Despite this colorful history, there is no evidence that a pirate named ""Gaspar"" or ""Gasparilla"" ever roamed the Florida coast. Archives in Spain make no mention of Gaspar as a member of the Spanish court or an officer in the Spanish navy; the U.S. Navy has no documentation indicating that any of its vessels ever encountered a pirate named Gaspar or a ship named Floriblanca, and neither Gaspar nor anyone claiming to be a member of his crew are mentioned in the records of hundreds of piracy trials from the era, which was well after the Golden Age of Piracy. Also, despite the fact that the supposed location of Gaspar's ""regal base"" at Gasparilla Island has been developed into the resort town of Boca Grande, no artifacts or other physical evidence of the hideout, his ship, or his lost treasure has ever been found in southwest Florida despite years of searching by amateur and professional treasure-seekers.
The first written account of José Gaspar appeared in the early 1900s as part of an advertising brochure for the Gasparilla Inn in the newly established town of Boca Grande on Gasparilla Island. The brochure was produced and widely distributed by the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway, which built the resort at the end of its rail line. Besides promotional material and contact information for the Gasparilla Inn, the brochure prominently featured the ""Story of Jose Gasparilla"", the ""last of the Buccaneers"" who it said had terrorized the Gulf of Mexico for almost 40 years.  Among its many dubious claims, the short biography said that the nickname ""Gasparilla"" means ""Gaspar the outlaw"" in Spanish when it is actually a diminutive form meaning ""little Gaspar""; it claimed that Gasparilla Island was named for the pirate when the name actually appears on Spanish and English maps from well before his supposed arrival; and it claimed that the ""bleached bones"" of Gaspar's victims along with many old coins had been discovered in local ""Indian mounds"" when no such find has ever been documented. The brochure also claimed that the bulk of Gaspar's vast treasure cache ""still lies unmoved"" somewhere in the vicinity of Boca Grande.
The brochure was penned by publicist Pat Lemoyne, who combined and embellished regional tall tales attributed to well-known and recently deceased local fishing guide ""Panther John"" Gomez to create the legend of the pirate Gaspar. Years later, Lemoyne gave a local history lecture in which he admitted that he had written the Gasparilla story ""in a style that tourists like to hear"" but that it was ""without a true fact in it.""
In 1923, author Francis Bradlee obtained a copy of the Gasparilla Inn brochure and, assuming it was factual, included Gaspar in a book he was writing about piracy in the West Indies. This error led to José Gaspar being mentioned in several additional non-fiction books about piracy and Florida history, causing ongoing confusion as to the authenticity of the legend. However, though many versions of Gaspar's adventures have been told in various forms over the years—including pulp adventure novels, tourist guides, and the official history of Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla—all have their basis in the fictional tale first printed in an advertisement for the Gasparilla Inn.

Parade origins
The first Gasparilla parade was held in May 1904, after Tampa Tribune society editor Louise Frances Dodge and Tampa's director of customs George Hardee decided to combine elements of New Orleans Mardi Gras with the legend of the local pirate to promote and enliven Tampa's May Day celebration. The first occurrence consisted of several dozen local businessmen disguising themselves as pirates, riding horses through town to simulate a surprise pirate invasion, and encouraging startled observers to follow them to the May Day festival. The second Gasparilla the following year was not a surprise, as every automobile owner in town was invited to join the mounted pirates in the parade. The pirate-themed festival was not held again until 1910, when it was revived as part of a community celebration marking the opening of the Panama Canal. In 1913, a Gasparilla Carnival that included a pirate parade and weekend festival was organized as an independent event, as it has remained ever since.

Pirate ship
The first several mock pirate invasions were land-based, with the backstory depicting the pirate ship Octopus anchored offshore. The first shipborne invasion came in 1911, when a merchant vessel was borrowed, decorated, and temporarily rechristened the Jose Gaspar for the day. A series of borrowed ships were used until the 1930s, when Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla bought an old merchant sloop and repurposed it as the Jose Gasparilla, which they used for about twenty years. The old wooden ship was in serious need of repairs and renovation by the early 1950s, so with financial assistance from the city of Tampa and the local chamber of commerce, YMKG commissioned a $100,000 replacement. The Jose Gasparilla II debuted during Gasparilla's 50th anniversary celebration in 1954 and has been used ever since.
Though designed to resemble an 18th-century West Indiaman, the Jose Gasparilla II is actually a 137-foot-long (42 m), 36-foot-wide (11 m) steel barge to which tall masts, a bowsprit, and other decorative elements have been added. Unlike earlier Gasparilla ships, the current pirate vessel has neither operable sails nor an engine, so on Gasparilla Day, it is guided through the flotilla of hundreds of private boats and watercraft by three tugboats under the direction of experienced harbor pilots. The Jose Gasparilla II has crossed Tampa Bay to lead every invasion since its launching except in 1971, when bad weather and rough seas canceled the flotilla, though not the parade.
For over half a century, various Gasparilla pirate ships would sail about half a mile up the Hillsborough River to Plant Park on the grounds of the University of Tampa, where members of YMKG would disembark for the parade. The construction of the Tampa Crosstown Expressway in 1976 ended that tradition, as the 100-foot (30 m) masts of the Jose Gasparilla II do not fit under the highway where it bridges the river near its mouth. Since 1992, the ship has made its way into Garrison Channel on Gasparilla Day to dock along the Tampa Riverwalk behind the Tampa Convention Center, where the pirate crew disembarks among thousands of revelers. Outside of Gasparilla season, the Jose Gasparilla II can usually be found moored near the northern end of Bayshore Boulevard within sight of downtown.

Location and dates
Parade route
At least a portion of the Gasparilla Parade of Pirates has traversed Bayshore Boulevard near downtown almost since its inception. For several decades, the parade route ended at Plant Field where the Florida State Fair was taking place, drawing more attendees to the simultaneous events. The fair moved to much larger grounds east of Tampa in 1976, but the parade route has usually remained the same, traveling north up Bayshore Boulevard and ending in or near downtown, approximately 4.5 miles (7.2 km) in total. Since 2011, the parade route has concluded at Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park along the Tampa Riverwalk, where festivities continue into the evening.
Though their exact route varies slightly from year to year, the route of the Gasparilla Children's Parade is about half the length of the main parade route and runs along Bayshore Boulevard, while the main leg of the Krewe of San'Yago Illuminated Knight Parade runs down 7th Avenue in Ybor City.

Schedule
The Gasparilla parade was held in conjunction with various other events in its early years, so its timing varied when it took place at all. The first mock invasion was held on May 4, 1904, and pirate-themed community festivities were held on dates ranging from February to November prior to World War I. The parade and related events were canceled during the involvement of the United States in the war, and when the festivities resumed in 1920, they were regularly scheduled for mid-February to coincide with the Florida State Fair. The Parade of Pirates went on another hiatus from 1942 through 1946 during World War II. When it returned in 1947, it was set for a Monday in mid-February, a tradition which lasted for almost four decades. Gasparilla Day became an official holiday in Hillsborough County during that period, with local schools and government offices closed for the festivities. In 1988, the Parade of Pirates was moved to the first Saturday in February so that out-of-towners could more easily take part. Since 2005, the parade has been held on the last Saturday in January except in 2021, when all major events of the Gasparilla Season were canceled due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
As the scheduling of the Parade of Pirates shifted over the years, the dates of the other two large parades of the season have generally shifted as well, with the Children's Parade held one week before and the Krewe of San'Yago Illuminated Knight Parade held two weeks after the main Gasparilla Parade.

YMKG integration / Super Bowl controversy
Background
The Parade of Pirates and related festivities have faced various criticisms over their long history, from complaints about unruly crowds and public drunkenness to observations that the tradition of local elites pretending to be a rapacious pirate crew plundering the city could be seen as problematic. Other criticism had its roots in the earliest iterations of the parade and the original organization behind the festival, and these critiques led to a controversy which gained national attention in the early 1990s.
Though Tampa was home to one of the largest and most prosperous Hispanic communities in the American South in the early 20th century, it was strictly racially segregated like the rest of the Deep South. Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla was established by Tampa's business and civic elite during the depths of the Jim Crow era, and the private and somewhat secretive organization remained exclusively white and male even after most public segregation had been rolled back during the Civil Rights era.
The parade itself made small steps towards inclusion over the years. Female relatives of YMKG members formed the Krewe of Venus in 1966 and were allowed to participate in the Gasparilla Parade the following year. Leading members of Tampa's Latin community formed the Krewe of the Knights of Sant' Yago in 1972 and organized their own parade in Ybor City beginning in 1974. However, though they could participate as spectators, African-Americans and others among Tampa's diverse population remained excluded from YMKG and direct participation.
By the 1980s, local minority organizations were publicly pointing out that exclusion from YMKG symbolized their continued exclusion from Tampa's top social and economic circles, as membership largely overlapped that other local organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce and key yacht and country clubs. An invitation to join YMKG did not only allow the invitee to dress like a pirate for the parade; it was a sign that they had ""arrived in the community"". As former Tampa mayor Bob Buckhorn later reflected, ""You had this huge ... public debate about the role of the Krewe of Gasparilla, but the larger issue was making sure that everyone had a seat at the table, particularly African Americans.""

1991 cancelation & replacement
This simmering issue grew into a heated controversy in 1990. Tampa and YMKG had agreed to stage the 1991 Parade of Pirates a week earlier than usual to coincide with Super Bowl XXV, which was to be played in Tampa Stadium in January. As planning commenced in 1990, local chapters of the NAACP and the Urban League made use of the media's focus on the internationally broadcast event to highlight YMKG's segregated membership, and the city and the National Football League pressured the Krewe to admit its first African-American members.
While claiming that it was not a racist organization and was open to accepting Black members, YMKG argued in September 1990 that it was ""too late"" to expand its membership before the 1991 parade and canceled Parade of Pirates instead. The city of Tampa hastily put together a replacement parade called ""Bamboleo"", which was billed as a ""multicultural festival"" and did not have a pirate theme. Rainy weather helped to dampen the crowds for the event, which some observers considered a ""flop"" whiile others hailed it as a step toward a more inclusive local community.
Later in 1991, YMKG admitted two Black members and agreed to allow additional krewes to join the parade, and the Parade of Pirates returned in 1992 with an expanded participant list that better reflected the community's population.

2001 ""Supersized"" Gasparilla
When Tampa hosted Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, the parade moved to the Saturday before the game as planned a decade before, and an integrated Krewe of Gasparilla was joined by over thirty other krewes before a record crowd of 750,000. Though ""Supersized Gasparilla"" was well received and was seen as a sign of the community's social progress, the city has opted not to repeat the schedule change when hosting subsequent Super Bowls due to the serious challenges posed by large crowds and snarled traffic across downtown and South Tampa.

Later developments
The number of krewes and other participating civic organizations has continued to grow in recent years, dampening controversies over inclusion. Due to practical concerns, participation in the Parade of Pirates is limited to fifty krewes per year, with smaller krewes taking turns on a rotating basis.

Bureaucratic difficulty in securing permits and event insurance were among reasons for the long-running free festival's end in 2019.

History
The first festival took place in 1969 and was held each year until 1984; following a ten-year hiatus festivals resumed in 1995. The event is organized as a fundraising event for the Hessler Neighborhood Association (HNA), which was formed in 1969 to save the neighborhood from being bulldozed to build student dormitories and parking lots for Case Western Reserve University. The proceeds are used ""to preserve and maintain the neighborhood.""
The festival, which according to its website attracts more than 10,000 visitors, is held outdoors, on Hessler Road (which is blocked off for the festival).  It typically includes arts and crafts vendors, vegetarian food, and street performances, as well as main stage performances of folk music, reggae, and capoeira.
Hessler Road, a small one-way residential brick street, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places and was declared a historic district by the Cleveland Landmark Commission in 1975. The nearby Hessler Court is the only remaining street in Cleveland with Nicolson pavement, a.k.a. wood block or wooden pavement.
In 2007 the Hessler Street Fair was not held, although a ""Hessler Unplugged"" reunion block party took place on Saturday, May 19, 2007. The Fair resumed on May 17–18, 2008.
2019 marked the 40th Anniversary of the Hessler Street Fair and marked the end of the tradition. 21 bands performed over the final weekend.

History
This downtown Austin festival was originally dreamed up, produced, funded and had event insurance secured by entrepreneur Marcy Fletcher and artist Michael Wolverton.  It was a juried show that required artists and craftsmen to have actually produced the work they sold. The management was later handed over to French Smith III, and was later taken over through legal action by the Old Pecan Street Association in 1997. Roadstar Productions, Smith's company, continued to produce it for eight more years. In the fall of 2006, the Old Pecan Street Association selected Special Events Management to run the festival.

History
In 1885, a New York reporter wrote that Saint Paul was, ""another Siberia, unfit for human habitation"" in winter. Offended by this attack on their city, the Saint Paul Chamber of Commerce decided to prove not only that Saint Paul was habitable but that its citizens were very much alive during winter, their most dominant season. A Winter Carnival had been held over the border in Montreal with an ice castle in 1885.  With a model to draw upon the Saint Paul Winter Carnival was created in 1886.  It was followed by carnivals held in 1887, 1888 and 1896. The Carnival was held again in 1916 and 1917. There was another lapse until 1937 when they continued through 1942.   WWII interrupted life in general, but the Carnival resumed in 1946.  It remains an annual event today.

In 1886, King Boreas the First was crowned and the first Winter Carnival commenced. This festival also featured an ice palace, an elaborate creation made from the ice of Minnesota lakes, which has evolved into an internationally recognized icon for Saint Paul's festival.
The event featured many activities, including bobsledding and ice horse-racing. The former name uniquely and directly describes the activity as frozen lakes were used as race surfaces for sled-carts. The organizers say the event also served to bring the community closer together, including members of nearby Native American tribes. Many members of local tribes would ride into the city and pitch tents to participate in the Winter Carnival.
2021 had a drive-thru carnival and saw strict measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, such as wearing masks & social distancing.

Today
The Winter Carnival has grown over the years. The Royal Family makes over 400 appearances annually and participates in community activities around the Twin Cities Metro Area and the state of Minnesota. As a community organization, the members of the Royal Family and Vulcan Krewe travel throughout the US and Canada visiting different communities and engaging in various festivals. They aim to promote community awareness and volunteerism and to support charitable causes.

Vulcan Krewe
The Vulcan Krewe represents the warm side of the Winter Carnival Legend. The Krewe is selected by the Order of Fire and Brimstone along with the new Fire King, Vulcanus Rex, each year.
Each year a new Krewe is hand selected through an application and interview process. Selected Krewe members must complete a five-year commitment to become a full-fledged member of Fire and Brimstone. After a member's fifth year, that individual is then eligible to be a Fire King.

Members of the Vulcan Krewe
Vulcanus Rex (The Vulc) - The True King of the Saint Paul Winter Carnival. Of all the members of the Krewe, he is the only one to wear red and black (all others wear only red).
General Flameous (Flame) - The Army Commander and Keeper of the flame. Legend says that if the flame dies, the Fire King dies and it will be winter forever.
The Duke of Klinker (Klinker) - The Fire King's aide-de-camp and the herder of the flock. The Klinker is the longest burning ember.
The Count of Ashes (Ash) - The raiser of sleeping spirits. The ""swinger"" of the Krewe.
The Prince of Soot (Sooty) - The recorder of past memories. The ""ladies' man"". Usually the oldest member of the Krewe.
Baron Hot Sparkus (Sparky) - Commander of the Lancer’s Legion and the Stoker of Emotions. The ""spark plug"" of the Vulcan Krewe.
Count Embrious (EB) - The Fire King’s Chancellor of the Exchequer. The young and romantic one. Usually the youngest member of the Krewe.
Grand Duke Fertilious (Ferty) - Minister of Propaganda and the propagator of progeny. Usually the member with the most children.

Vulcan attire
The Fire King running suit, the uniform
In the early carnivals, when the Fire King ran alone, he wore typically kingly attire, crown and all, with heavy emphasis on the color red in the rest of the costume. In 1916, Ron Stewart, Vulcanus Rex I, wore a warm blanket coat with a wide sash and a headpiece with devil-type horns on it. This attire continued through 1939.
Again, in 1940, Vulcanus Rex VI, E.R. Reiff, designed the basic running suit worn today. The horns were replaced by two feathers at the back of the head with a central fin running across the top of the head from front to back. In 1959 the feathers disappeared by order of Vulcanus Rex XXII, John Works. In February, 2012, Vulcanus Rex LXXV; Steve Robertson,  began wearing a crown following the overthrow of Boreas to signify Vulcanus Rex as the Victorious King of the Saint Paul Winter Carnival. 
There are six primary pieces to the current running suit: the hat, the running suit, the cape, boots, gloves, goggles, and grease.

The Knighting Ceremony
These ceremonies were started in 1956. Every year, the Fire King ""knights"" hundreds of individuals. Special people are singled out by the king and his ""Krewe"" for this award. A knighting certificate consists of a ""title"" being bestowed, and a certificate being presented. Titles bestowed usually reflect the individual's special contribution to a community, company, club or organization, or family.

The Royal Chariot
The current fire engine being used by the Krewe was built in 1932 by Luverne Fire Apparatus of Luverne, Minnesota. Starting out in 1932 as Saint Paul Squad 1 and in 1940 becoming a reserve hose cart, it is believed to be the only one of its type left. The City of Saint Paul began allowing the Krewe to use this fire engine in the late 1950s. Over the years the fire engine has been rebuilt many times while maintaining most of the original body and frame. In 1996, Fire & Brimstone took over ownership and upkeep of the truck.

The Order of Fire and Brimstone
In the late 1940s some of the former Krewe members formed a group that included only former Vulcans. In 1958 it was made into a fully incorporated organization.
Fire & Brimstone is run by a board of directors that is elected by the general membership at their annual meeting. This board's main objective is to provide support for the Vulcan Krewe and also to  plan many activities and events for F&B members and their families to attend throughout the year.

Medallion hunt
Starting in 1952, each year during the carnival, there is an annual treasure hunt.  The Saint Paul Pioneer Press prints in their newspaper 12 clues on 12 consecutive days.  These clues point to a local park, where participants race to the park they think the clues point them towards, and start searching for the medallion.  The clues are often cryptic until the 12th day, when people line up outside the newspaper offices, cell phones in hand and partners in parks, when the 12th clue gives them almost the exact location.  The medallion has previously been hidden in a diaper, a White Castle hamburger box, a pop can, inside an Oreo cookie, and frozen in ice.  The finders of the medallion are awarded up to $10,000 and receive a place of honor riding in the closing Torchlight Parade.

Ice Palace
To date, the St. Paul Winter Carnival has built 42 Ice Palaces. Ice palaces have been built in 1886, 1887, 1888, 1896, 1917, 1937, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1986, 1988, 1992, 2004, 2018, and since 2021, among other years.

Cornerstone Festival was a member of the Christian Festival Association.

History
From 1984 to 1990, Cornerstone was held at the Lake County Fairgrounds near Grayslake, Illinois. In 1991, Cornerstone moved near the town of Bushnell (outside Macomb) where the organizers of the festival purchased a large piece of land, which is now called ""Cornerstone Farm"".
Tens of thousands of people attended Cornerstone Farm each year and saw over 300 bands play many styles of music, including rock, metal, punk, hardcore and pop music. In addition to the many musicians, Cornerstone Festival also presented guest speakers, and featured independent/foreign film screenings, writers' seminars, and art workshops.
In 2010 the festival's main stage moved to the ""Midway"", which is about 0.7 miles northeast of its previous location in the ""bowl"".
The 2011 festival featured a Jesus Rally showcasing many of the groundbreaking Jesus music artists including; Servant, Daniel Amos, Randy Stonehill, Barry McGuire, Resurrection Band, Phil Keaggy, and Classic Petra.
On May 15, 2012 it was announced that the 2012 Festival would be the last. The final song performed at Cornerstone, on July 7, 2012, was ""To Bid Farewell"" performed by Derri Daugherty and Steve Hindalong of The Choir.
The festival ceased due to budgetary reasons.

History
Creation Festival (Northeast)
Rev. Dr. Harry Thomas Jr. and Timothy Landis founded Creation East in 1979 in Muddy Run Park in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.  After just five years, the festival outgrew Muddy Run Park and had to change venues.  In 1984, the Creation Festival was moved to the Agape Campground in Mount Union, Pennsylvania when the board of Jesus Ministries offered to rent out the area for the festival. This year was also the first year for a festival-wide Communion, which has since become a yearly tradition.
Creation '88 marked the festival's tenth year celebration with the largest crowd ever to participate in the festival. The 1988 festival concluded with a large fireworks display, which continues to be a memorable part of all Creation Festivals. The first fireworks display at the Creation Festival was in 1983.
In 1992, the festival opened a second stage, ""The Fringe Stage"". Due to the festival's positive response to the concept of multiple stages, by 1994 both stages were operating continually and in tandem to provide more variety and availability of bands and speakers.
Due to thunderstorms and severe flooding, the festival was canceled in 1995 and 2006. In 1996 and 2003, the festival was held in Hershey, Pennsylvania, with the concerts taking place in the Hersheypark complex arenas. Fans attending the four-day festival were offered a reduced price ticket to Hersheypark and camped alongside a large hill.
In 2008, the festival started an annual tour, passing through more than 30 cities across the U.S.
In 2010, Creation Northeast was held at Agape Farm in Mount Union, Pennsylvania, from June 30 to July 3.
After Tim Landis stepped out of his original role, Rev. Dr. Harry Thomas Jr. continued to be involved, focusing mainly on expanding the ministry of the festival, and passed on the majority of the production and booking to Bill Darpino. Thomas preached a short message at Creation every year.
In December 2017, Thomas was arrested and charged with sexually assaulting minors in Medford Township, New Jersey over a 16-year period. In February 2018, Thomas pleaded guilty to five counts of sexual assault, and was sentenced in July 2018 to 18 years in prison with no eligibility for parole. Thomas died in April 2022.
The event was postponed in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In 2022, Creation Northeast returned to Agape Farm from June 29 to July 2.

Creation Northwest (1998–2017)
In 1998, the festival expanded to the west with the addition of ""Creation Northwest"" (aka Creation West) at the Gorge Amphitheatre in George, Washington. In 2010, Creation Festival Northwest moved to the Enumclaw Expo Center in Enumclaw, Washington. Following the 2013 festival, Creation pulled out of Enumclaw after negotiating a contract for a new venue at the Benton-Franklin Fairgrounds in Kennewick, Washington starting in 2014.
In January 2018, Creation Festivals announced postponement of the Northwest festival until 2019, with multiple options for those who had already purchased 2018 tickets. Creation Northwest announced in December 2018 their decision to cancel for 2019. Creation Northwest announced in September 2019 via their ""creationwest"" Facebook page that they would not relaunch in 2020.

Other concerts (2014–2016)
Creation operated the Sonshine Festival from 2014 to 2016. Citing financial reasons, Sonshine 2017 was paused, with ""hope and desire to see [it] return in 2018"", according to the festival's webpage.
Creation Festival acquired the rights to the Ichthus Festival in May 2013. As the 2013 concert was cancelled in December 2012, the group planned to host a Creation Ichthus Festival 2014 event. These plans were cancelled on April 12, 2014. Instead, the Creation Ichthus Festival 2015 was held from July 8 to 11, 2015, at the Kentucky Horse Park in Fayette County, Kentucky. Artists included Red, Fireflight, Newsboys, Relient K and more. The Creation Ichthus Festival was discontinued in 2016, and Asbury University acquired rights to the Ichthus name that year, later reviving the Ichthus Festival in 2021.

History
LifeLight Festival was started by Alan and Vicki Greene in 1998 as an afternoon concert at Good News Reformed Church on Valley View Rd, drawing about 2,000 people.  By 2001, the festival was moved to the W.H. Lyons Fairgrounds in Sioux Falls to accommodate the growing crowds.  In 2002, attendance tripled from the year before, growing to 32,000 attendees over a 3-day weekend.  LifeLight has since grown to over 320,000 attendees over a 3-day weekend, expanding to six stages, with a budget of nearly $700,000 each year. After outgrowing previous locations, the LifeLight festival found a new permanent home for the Festival on a family farm near Worthing, South Dakota.  The 2010 Festival was the first at the new location.  It is a free concert but provides a great economic boost to Sioux Falls. Festivals like this one said to bring up to $10 million. 
Since 2005, LifeLight has also sponsored spring and fall tours featuring LifeLight artists. They started as local tours with primarily local artists but over the years, LifeLight Tours has partnered with several national and regional bands/speakers and now travel well beyond the Midwest for tour dates.  Past tours have featured artists John Reuben, Brian Welch, Sanctus Real,  Phil Joel, Disciple, Project 86, Children 18:3 and many more and traveled to cities in Texas, Illinois, Nebraska, Colorado, Minnesota, Iowa, and South Dakota as well as other states. The 2013 festival in South Dakota hosted main showings of Plumb, Newsboys, Audio Adrenaline, and Skillet.
No festival was held in 2020-2022 due to the Coronavirus Pandemic
In 2023, the festival was held at the 8th & railroad district parking lot in downtown Sioux Falls. Despite temperatures of over 100 degrees, 30,000 people attended. In 2024 the festival is to be held at Nelson Park in eastern Sioux Falls to increase capacity.

Approximately 30,000 people volunteer to plan, organize, and provide labor for the Aloha Festivals each year. Their efforts entertain over 1,000,000 people from throughout the state and visitors from all over the world.

History
Establishment
In the spirit of preserving the Hawaiian culture and heritage, the Aloha Festivals were established in 1946 as Aloha Week by former members of the local Junior Chamber of Commerce. The former manager of the festivals, Goriann Akau, has said, ""In 1946, after the war, Hawaiians needed an identity. We were lost and needed to regroup. When we started to celebrate our culture, we began to feel proud. We have a wonderful culture that had been buried for a number of years. This brought it out again. Self-esteem is more important than making a lot of money.""

Scaling down
The festival was celebrated on six of Hawaii's islands, but in 2008 festival organizers decided to hold most events on Oahu due to a lack of funding. There was also the chance that the Floral Parade would be cancelled altogether, but it was saved by private donors and funds from the City and County of Honolulu.
No Aloha festival was held in 2020. (This was first year of the Covid-19 pandemic, a year which had many disruptions)

Events
Presentation of the Royal Court
The court is selected from a pool of applicants, all of whom must be of Hawaiian ancestry and of certain ages. The festival itself begins with the presentation of the royal court during the opening ceremony. The ceremony takes place at Helumoa, a section of Waikiki near the Royal Hawaiian Center.

Floral Parade

History
The Arlington International Film Festival was founded in 2010 by April Ranck and Alberto Guzman, in the aim of exploring and promoting the cultural diversity through the lens of independent films in a wide range of topics and areas. Jumping from 53 submissions the first year to over 142 the following year, the festival has been a significant success and attracts many enthusiast moviegoers. Hundreds of submissions are now watched by AIFF's Selection Committee each year and many of the selected films have been nominated for Academy Awards, while others have been purchased by CNN, POV PBS and Nova. The festival was held during four consecutive years at the historic Regent Theatre in Arlington. In 2015, the festival took place at the Kendall Square Cinema, Massachusetts. In 2016, the annual festival returned to his home city in Arlington, and was held at the Capitol Theater, in Arlington, Massachusetts. The number of films submissions continues to increase with a strong participation of filmmakers as well as a growing audience. For its 10th anniversary, Arlington Int’l Film Festival, like many others, was hit by the devastating COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. There was no red carpet to walk, but instead an Online Festival was held from November 5 to November 15, 2020, in partnership with the social-media marketing company HappsNow and the streaming platform Xerb.tv. In lieu of in person interviews, filmmakers were invited to make an introduction prior to their film being screened and more than hundred films, documentary and narrative features including shorts plus two programs of animation shorts were screened during the 2020 year's festival. Once again, AIFF welcomed high school students. This program named: “Voices of Our Youth” wrapped up a collection of nearly 60 shorts films. In 2021, given the Covid 19 situation, with safety in mind, the Festival was still virtual for another year. But yet, AIFF was able to fulfill its mission and offered a good selection of films. On November 3, 2022, the AIFF was glad to be back at the Capital Theater to host its 12th annual Festival. From November 3, to November 5, 2023, the annual festival showcased more than 40 films, documentaries and shorts at the Capitol Theater. Some of them being chosen for a world-wide tour and nominated for Academy Award.

Highlights
In 2014, the ""Martin Luther King Community"" awarded AIFF for spreading diversity and awareness of African-American culture, 
In 2012, the AIFF received the Year Award from the Arlington Chamber of Commerce, and in 2013,  the Mc Clennen Community Arts Award from Arlington Center for the Arts in recognition for building community, as well as the Gold Star Award from the Massachusetts Cultural Council for its 2013 poster contest.
In January 2014, in conjunction with the Visual Art Department of the Arlington High School, AIFF brought artist Winfred Rembert for a 5-day residency. AIFF has also partnered with the Boston Environmental Film Festival, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and Boston Irish Film Festival. In addition, AIFF worked with the filmmaker Alice Rotchild, of documentary Voices Across the Divide, which co-won the Boston Palestine Film Festival's ‘2013 Audience Award for Best Film.
Two films: Botso: The Teacher from Tbilisi and Elena that were showcased at the Arlington International Festival in 2014 were among the 134 features nominated in the 'Documentary Feature' category at the 87th Academy Awards.
For the 9th annual festival, AIFF launched a new award: ""Audience Choice Awards , sponsored by Spy Pond Productions. These awards were named in honor of Fran Ranck Tood, who passed in the spring of 2019. He was a faithful supporter and ambassador of the AIFF.

In the United States, the ""Festa of San Gennaro"" is also a highlight of the year for New York's Little Italy, with the saint's polychrome statue carried through the middle of a street fair stretching for blocks.

In Italy
History
On 19 September 305, Gennaro (Latin: Ianuarius), bishop of Benevento, was beheaded in Pozzuoli during the persecution of Christians by Diocletian. According to the legend,

The blood gushed due to the decapitation was collected and kept in an ampoule by Eusebia, who had been his wet nurse.
In 313, the martyr's body was being moved to Naples, and the procession stopped to rest in what would be today's piazza Bernini, in the area known as Vomero. Eusebia put the vials containing the martyr's blood near his head, and the blood started to melt, at the presence of the local bishop.
San Gennaro was named patron and protector of the city, and is invoked by the people of Naples on several occasions, e.g. to ask for help, healing and special favors; memorably, he was called on to stop the 1631 eruption of Mount Vesuvius, and the lava – that was about to destroy the towns around it – slowed down.
Meanwhile, with very few exceptions, the blood miracle happens again and again, three times a year:

the Saturday prior the first Sunday of May – the day when the saint's body was transferred from Pozzuoli to Naples;
on 19 September – the day of his martyrdom;
and, finally, on 16 December – date when the saint interceded to end the 1631 eruption of Mount Vesuvius.

Celebration
In Naples and neighboring areas, an annual celebration and feast of faith is held over the course of three days, commemorating Saint Gennaro. Throughout the festival, parades, religious processions and musical entertainment are featured.
The focus of the celebration is the miracle of San Gennaro's blood melting, also simply known as the miracle of San Gennaro, or blood miracle.

In the United States
Little Italy, New York
The festival was first celebrated in the United States in September 1926, when immigrants from Naples congregated along Mulberry Street in the Little Italy section of Manhattan in New York City to continue the tradition they had followed in Italy to celebrate Saint Januarius, the Patron Saint of Naples.
The immigrant families on Mulberry Street who started the feast, a group of cafe owners, erected a small chapel in the street to house the image of their patron Saint. They invited all to partake of their wares, asking the devoted to pin an offering to the ribbon streamers that are hung from the statue's apron. This money was then distributed to the needy poor of the neighborhood. Originally a one-day religious commemoration, over time, the festival expanded into an 11-day street fair organized and run by people outside the neighborhood. It is now an annual celebration of food and drink, and a major tourist attraction.
Centered on Mulberry Street, which is closed to traffic for the occasion, the festival generally features sausages, zeppole, street vendors, games, parades and other such attractions. The Grand Procession is held starting at 2 p.m. on the last Saturday of the feast, immediately after a celebratory Mass at the Church of the Most Precious Blood. This is a Roman Catholic candlelit procession in which the statue of San Gennaro is carried from its permanent home in the Most Precious Blood Church through the streets of Little Italy.
Another festival is held with the same attractions in New York City's other Little Italy, in the Fordham/Belmont community in the Bronx. The streets are closed to traffic, and the festivities begin early in the morning and proceed late into the night.

Corruption
In 1995, following the exposure of financial improprieties and mafia involvement, New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani declared that if the city's San Gennaro festival did not remove corrupt elements, he would shut it down.
After Giuliani's ultimatum, a community group was formed to manage the festival; the municipal government asked it to hire a professional manager, and it hired Mort Berkowitz to be the financial manager.

Other locations
Similar festivals have also been sponsored in other cities.
In 1980, Vincent Jimmy Palmisano brought the Feast of San Gennaro to the Las Vegas Valley, Nevada, for the first time. The event was hosted and entertained by Tony Sacca from 1986 to 2016, along with celebrities from the strip such as Pat Cooper, Ernest Borgnine, Jerry Vale, Liberace, Frankie Avalon.
The Las Vegas festival is now held twice a year, in the Spring and Fall. This bi-annual festival features traditional Italian cuisine, amusement rides and games, and entertainers such as Emilio Baglioni, Chazz Palminteri, Tommy DeVito from the Jersey Boys and Louis Prima's daughter, Lena Prima.
In 2002, Jimmy Kimmel, Adam Carolla, and Doug DeLuca founded the Feast of San Gennaro Los Angeles, which is now a major annual event held every September in Hollywood.
In 2011, Hampton Bays (Long Island, New York) started their San Gennaro celebration. It has since grown rapidly to become the largest San Gennaro Feast on Long Island, and second only to the Little Italy Feast in New York State. The Hampton Bays Feast of San Gennaro draws a huge crowd, with live bands, raffles and prizes, and vendors selling food and drink.
In 2012, the Feast of San Gennaro of the Jersey Shore was established in Belmar, New Jersey, by Daniel Di Cesare, whose goal was to highlight the positive contributions of Italian Americans.
In 2013, the San Gennaro Festival was brought to Seattle, WA, by the Mascio family, who formed the San Gennaro Foundation Seattle. Held the second week of September, it includes the procession of the San Gennaro statue, live music and food. This three day festival is held in the heart of Georgetown, WA, where many of Seattle's Italian community settled when they first arrived in Seattle.

In popular culture
The feast features prominently in the second entry of Francis Ford Coppola's cinematic opus, The Godfather Part II (1974), serving as backdrop to a young Vito Corleone murdering the Don Fanucci character. In The Godfather Part III (1990), Vincent Corleone assassinates Joey Zasa at the festa.
It was a crime scene on CSI: NY in the season 2 episode ""Corporate Warriors"".
It was also featured prominently in the 1973 movie Mean Streets.
It is mentioned in the song ""Sad Nights"" by Blue Rodeo.
In ""The Ride"" (Season 6 Episode 9 of The Sopranos) Tony, Carmela, and several other members of the family attend a fictitious festival in Newark patterned after this feast. It is the Feast of Elzéar of Sabran which also has a connection with Naples and is celebrated on September 27.
Brian Altano tells a story about the (few) differences between the New Jersey festival and the Italian festival in The GameSpy Debriefings episode 158.
On The Golden Girls, in the episode ""The Accurate Conception"" (Season Five, Episode 3), when the girls shared stories of how their children were conceived, Sophia Petrillo joyfully recalls how she and her husband Salvador attempted conception of Dorothy behind the sausage and pepper stand due to the excitement of the San Gennaro's festivities, much to Dorothy's dismay. Also on The Golden Girls, in the episode called ""The Competition"" (Season 1, Episode 7), Sophia wants to return to Sicily for the San Gennaro Festival with a long-lost love, Augustine Bagatelli.
On Laverne & Shirley, the two-part season 4 opener has the characters travelling to New York to attend the festival.
In the Marvel: Avengers Alliance game, magic has brought the statue of San Gennaro to life, and a hero can be sent to fight it.
On Family Guy: season 15 episode 2, a parody of The Godfather II's scene mentioned above.

Things took place regularly, usually at prominent places accessible by travel. They provided legislative functions, as well as social events and trade opportunities. In modern usage, the meaning of this word in English and other languages has shifted to mean not just an assemblage of some sort but simply an object of any kind. Thingstead (Old English: þingstede) or ""thingstow"" (Old English: þingstōw) is the English term for the location where a thing was held.

Etymology
The word appears in Old Norse, Old English, and modern Icelandic as þing, in Middle English (as in modern English), Old Saxon, Old Dutch, and Old Frisian as thing (the difference between þing and thing is purely orthographical), in German as Ding, in Dutch and Afrikaans as ding, and in modern Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, Faroese, Gutnish, and Norn as ting. The place where a thing was held was called a ""thingstead"" or ""thingstow"". An alternative Proto-Germanic form of the word 'thing' was *þingsō, whence Gothic þeihs 'time'. All of these terms derive from  *þingą meaning ""appointed time,"" possibly originating in Proto-Indo-European *ten-, ""stretch,"" as in a ""stretch of time for an assembly"".
In English, the term is attested from 685 to 686 in the older meaning ""assembly""; later, it referred to a being, entity or matter (sometime before 899), and then also an act, deed, or event (from about 1000). The original sense of ""meeting, assembly"" did not survive the shift to Middle English. The meaning of personal possessions, commonly in the plural, first appears in Middle English around 1300, and eventually led to the modern sense of ""object"". This semantic development from ""assembly"" to ""object"" is mirrored in the evolution of the Latin causa (""judicial lawsuit"", ""case"") to modern French chose, Spanish/Italian/Catalan cosa, and Portuguese coisa (all meaning ""object"" or ""thing"") and the cognate to English sake (purpose), sak in Norwegian and Swedish, sag in Danish, zaak in Dutch, saak in Afrikaans, and Sache in German, which in languages like Old Norse meant ""accusation, lawsuit,"" but today also carries the sense ""thing, object"".
Today the term lives on in the English term hustings and in the names of national legislatures and political and judicial institutions of some Nordic countries (e.g. the Icelandic parliament, the Alþing) and the Isle of Man (the Tynwald). In modern German and Dutch, the day Tuesday is named after the thing, namely 'Dienstag' and 'dinsdag.'

Early attestations
The first detailed description of a thing was made by Tacitus in 98 CE. Tacitus suggested that the things were annual delegate-based meetings that served legal and military functions.
The oldest written reference to a thing is on a stone pillar found along Hadrian's Wall at Housesteads Roman Fort in Northumberland in the United Kingdom. It is dated 43–410 CE and reads:

DEO MARTI THINCSO ET DUABUS ALAISIAGIS BEDE ET FIMMILENE ET N AUG GERM CIVES TUIHANTI VSLMTo the god Mars Thincsus and the two Alaisiagae, Beda and Fimmilena, and to the Divinity of the Emperor the Germanics, being tribesmen of Tuihanti, willingly and deservedly fulfilled their vow.
The pillar was raised by a Frisian auxiliary unit of the Roman army deployed at Hadrian's Wall. The name Tuihanti refers to the current region Twente, which is in the east of the Netherlands. However, these Tuihanti tribesmen have been interpreted by different historians as Frisians. Deo Mars Thincsus means 'god Mars of the Thing'. ""Mars of the Thing"" may be interpreted in analogy with the week-day name (the Germanic Tuesday corresponding to Latin Martis dies 'the day of Mars'; cf. Interpretatio germanica) as Tīwaz of the Thing. The god Tīwaz (Old English Tíw, Old Norse Týr) was likely important in early Germanic times and has numerous places in England and Denmark named after him. The possible theonyms Beda and Fimmilena in the same inscription relate to the bodthing and fimelthing, two specific types of assemblies were recorded in Old Frisian codices from around 1100 onward. Perhaps the distinction was that the fixed thing was protected by the god Thincsus, the extraordinary thing by Beda, and the informative or non-decision-making thing by Fimmilena.
The Anglo-Saxon folkmoot (Old English: folcgemōt;Middle English: folkesmōt; Norwegian: folkemøte) was analogous, the forerunner to the witenagemōt ""royal council"" and a precursor of the modern Parliament of the United Kingdom.

Use in Germanic society
In the Viking Age, things were the public assemblies of the free men of a country, province, or a hundred (Swedish: härad, hundare, Danish: herred). They functioned as parliaments and courts at different levels of society—local, regional, and supra-regional. Their purpose was to solve disputes and make political decisions, and thingsteads were often places for public religious rites. According to Norway's Law of the Gulating, only free men of full age could participate in the assembly. According to written sources, women were present at some things despite being left out of decision-making bodies, such as the Icelandic Althing.
For prechristian Norse clans, the members of a clan were obliged to avenge injuries against their dead and mutilated relatives. As a result, feuding is often seen as the most common form of conflict resolution used in Viking society. However, things are in a more general sense, balancing structures used to reduce tribal feuds and avoid social disorder in North Germanic cultures. They played an essential role in Viking society as forums for conflict resolution, marriage alliances, power display, honor, and inheritance settlements.
In Sweden, assemblies were held at natural and man-made mounds, often burial mounds. Specifically in Scandinavia, unusually large runestones and inscriptions suggesting a local family's attempt to claim supremacy are standard features of thingsteads. It is common for assembly sites close to communication routes, such as navigable water routes and clear land routes.
The thing met at regular intervals, legislated, elected chieftains and kings, and judged according to the law, which was memorized and recited by the lawspeaker (judge). The thing's negotiations were presided over by the lawspeaker and the chieftain or the king. More and more scholarly discussions centre around the things being forerunners to democratic institutions as we know them today. The Icelandic Althing is considered to be the oldest surviving parliament in the world, the Norwegian Gulating also dating back to 900–1300.  While the things were not democratic assemblies in the modern sense of an elected body, they were built around ideas of neutrality and representation, effectively representing the interests of larger numbers of people. In Norway, the thing was a space where free men and elected officials met and discussed matters of collective interest, such as taxation. Though some scholars say that the things were dominated by the most influential members of the community, the heads of clans and wealthy families, other scholars describe how every free man could put forward his case for deliberation and share his opinions. History professor Torgrim Titlestad describes how Norway, with the thing sites, displayed an advanced political system over a thousand years ago, one that was characterized by high participation and democratic ideologies. These things also served as courts of law, and if one of the smaller things could not reach agreement, the matter at hand would be brought to one of the bigger things, which encompassed larger areas. The legislature of Norway is still known as the Storting (Big Thing) today.
Towards the end of the Viking Age, royal power became centralized, and the kings consolidated power and control over assemblies. As a result, things lost most of their political role and began to function mainly as courts in the later Middle Ages.

Norway
In the period between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries, Norway went through a state-formation process that elevated the control and power of the king. On the regional level, it has been assumed that the king would have taken control of the organization of assemblies via local representatives. Today, few thingsteads from Norway are known for sure, and as new assembly sites are found, scholars question whether these are old jurisdiction districts which the king used as a foundation for his organization or whether he created new administrative units. In southeast Norway in particular, one hypothesis for why the king would have established new thing sites might be that they were a ""strategic geopolitical response to the threat from the Danish king in the beginning of the 11th century."" Since the record of Norwegian thing sites is not comprehensive, it is not favorable to rely on archeological and topographical characteristics to determine whether they were established before the state-formation period.
In northern and southwestern Norway, there appears to have been a close association between chieftains' farms and sites interpreted as assemblies or court sites. These areas were considered neutral ground where the landowning elite could meet for political reasons and for Norse rituals. This view is based partly on Norse sagas' narratives of Viking chieftains and the distribution of large grave mounds. Ultimately, this neutrality was important for thing participants' cooperation; royal officials required cooperation to look after the king's interests in local areas. In this regard, Norwegian things became an arena for cooperation between the royal representatives and the farmers.
Based on what is known from later medieval documents, one deep-rooted custom of Norwegian law areas was the bearing of arms coming from the old tradition of the wapentake ""weapon-take"", which refers to the rattling of weapons at meetings to agree. The Law of the Gulating provides that the handling of these weapons should be controlled and regulated.
This is seen at Haugating, the thing for Vestfold in Norway, which was located in Tønsberg at Haugar (from the Old Norse haugr meaning hill or mound). This site was one of Norway's most important places for the proclamation of kings. In 1130, Harald Gille called together a meeting at the Haugating, where he was declared King of Norway. Sigurd Magnusson was proclaimed king in 1193 at the Haugating. Magnus VII was acclaimed hereditary King of Norway and Sweden at the Haugating in August 1319.

Sweden
Similar to Norway, thing sites in Sweden experienced changes in administrative organization beginning in the late tenth and eleventh century. This resulted from the power struggle between the rising Christian royal power establishing itself and the old, local magnate families attempting to maintain control. The battle for power between the king and local magnates is most visible through runic inscriptions at thing sites used to make power statements. Swedish assembly sites could be characterized by several typical features: large mounds, rune-stones, and crossings between roads by land or water to allow for greater accessibility.
A famous incident took place when Þorgnýr the Lawspeaker told the Swedish king Olof Skötkonung (c. 980–1022) that the people, not the king, held power in Sweden; the king realized that he was powerless against the thing and gave in. The main things in Sweden were the Thing of all Swedes, the Thing of all Geats, and the Lionga thing.
The island of Gotland had twenty things in late medieval times, each represented at the island-thing called landsting by its elected judge. New laws were decided at the landsting, which also took other decisions regarding the island. The landsting's authority was successively eroded after the island was occupied by the Teutonic Order in 1398. In late medieval times, the thing comprised twelve representatives for the farmers, free-holders or tenants.

Iceland
As a representative legislative body, the things in Iceland were similar to those in greater Scandinavia but had a clear organizational structure. Iceland was divided into four administrative quarters during the Viking Age with a fixed number of thirty-nine goðis ""lawmakers"": twelve goðis in the northern quarter and nine each in the eastern, southern, and western quarters.
The main distinction between Iceland and greater Scandinavia lies in the organization of the Icelandic Althing (Alþingi), the main assembly during the Viking period and the Middle Ages. Unlike other European societies in the Middle Ages, Iceland was unique for relying on the Althing's legislative and judicial institutions at the national level rather than an executive branch of government. Þingvellir was the site of the Althing, and it was a place where people came together once a year to bring cases to court, render judgments, and discuss laws and politics. At the annual Althing, the thirty-nine goðis along with nine others served as voting members of the Law Council (Lögrétta), a legislative assembly. The Lögrétta reviewed the laws which the lawspeaker recited, made new laws, set fines and punishments and were informed of sentences of outlawry and banishment passed by the courts in local spring assemblies.
Besides the Althing, there were local assembly districts in each of the four quarters of Iceland, and each year a Spring Assembly (vorþing) was brought together by three goðis who lived in each local assembly district (samþingsgoðar). The four quarters also had courts (fjórðungsdómar) that met at the Althing after a constitutional reform around 965. The goðis appointed the judges for these courts from the farmers in their districts.

Greenland
In the early twentieth century, scholars identified two potential Greenlandic thing sites at Brattahlíð in Eiríksfjörður and Garðar in Einarsfjörður; both are located in the Eastern Settlement of Greenland. These two sites were located through written sources and archeological evidence. Between these two Greenlandic sites, several overlapping characteristics support the hypothesis that these booth sites are assemblies. However, not all ""assembly features"" previously seen in Scandinavia appear at every assembly site, and there are also characteristics that have either not been recorded in Greenland or are unique to Greenland.
The temporary turf structures of Greenland have only been recorded in Iceland and would not have been seen at the assembly sites of Viking Age Sweden. Further, the booth sites at Brattahlíð and Garðar were close to high-status farms. Taken together, it indicates that trade would have taken place at these sites, and given the sparse nature of the Greenlandic settlement, it is reasonable that the participants of a thing would have taken the opportunity for social interaction or trade when gathered with others.

British Isles
In England, there is Thingwall on the Wirral. In the Yorkshire and former Danelaw areas of England, wapentakes—another name for the same institution—were used in public records. Several places ending in the -by ""village"" place name suffix originally possessed their laws, by-laws, and jurisdiction subject to the wapentake in which they served, which often extended over a surrounding ground called a thorpe ""hamlet"". If there were a riding surrounding the wapentake, the wapentake would merely be a local assembly coordinating the power of the riding. In Scandinavian York's case, it would be under the king's command at what is now King's Square, York.
The Kingdom of East Anglia controlled the Danelaw, which had been organized as the Five Boroughs. The Five were fortifications defending the land against Wessex, or against the Vikings, depending on who ruled there; together with Lindsey, Lincolnshire, which was divided into three ridings like Yorkshire. Again, the naming of the two roads named Inner and Outer Ting Tong on a hill-top in Devon between Budleigh Salterton, Woodbury and Exmouth is widely derided as fanciful, but may be derived from Thing-Tun, a dun (hill fort) or tun (settlement) around the place where the Thing used to meet.
Thynghowe was an important Danelaw meeting place, or thing, located in Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire, England. It was lost to history until its rediscovery in 2005–06 by local history enthusiasts Lynda Mallett and Stuart Reddish. The site lies amidst the old oaks of an area known as the Birklands in Sherwood Forest. Experts believe it may also indicate the boundary of the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. English Heritage has recently inspected the site, and has confirmed it was known as the Thynghowe in 1334 and 1609. It functioned as a place where people came to resolve disputes and settle issues. Thynghowe is an Old Norse name, although the site may be older than the Danelaw, perhaps even Bronze Age. Howe is derived from the Old Norse word haugr ""mound"". This often indicates the presence of a prehistoric burial mound.

Frisia
The Frisian Kingdom knew three levels of things: the highest level of the civitas, the middle level of the pagus, and the lowest level of the centena (hundredth). The pagi are the oldest building block, and they probably took place three times a year and were attended by all freemen. Early-medieval Frisia consisted of about 16 pagi. The other thing levels only became relevant during the Middle Ages. The thing was led by law-speakers called asega ""lawspeaker"". Every pagus had its own thing, but due to a lack of written sources, it isn't easy to establish where the thingsteads were. Thing sites are being presumed by historians at Naaldwijk in the pagus Maasland (Land of the River Meuse), at Katwijk in the pagus Rijnland ""land of the Rhine"", at Heemskerk in the pagus Kennemerland, at De Waal in the pagus Texel, at Franeker in the pagus Westergo and at Dokkum in the pagus Oostergo. From the 12th century the thing called Upstalsboom took place on the level of the civitas. At Upstalsboom, near the current town of Aurich in the East Frisia region, Germany, delegates and judges from all seven Frisian sealands used to gather once a year.

Place names
The assembly of things were typically held at a specially designated place, often a field or common, like Þingvellir, the old location of the Icelandic Alþing. The parliament of the Isle of Man is still named after the meeting place of the thing, Tynwald, which etymologically is the same word as þingvellir; there is still an annual public assembly at Tynwald Hill each July 5, where the new Manx laws are read out and petitions delivered). Other equivalent place names can be found across northern Europe: in Scotland, there is Dingwall in the Scottish Highlands and Tingwall, occurring both in Orkney and Shetland, and further south there is Tinwald, in Dumfries and Galloway and – in England – Thingwall, a village on the Wirral Peninsula. In Sweden, there are several places named Tingvalla, the modern Swedish form of Þingvellir, and the Norwegian equivalent is found in the place name Tingvoll. In Dublin, Ireland, the Thingmote was a raised mound, 40 foot high and 240 foot in circumference, where the Norsemen assembled and made their laws. It stood south of the river, where Saint Andrew's Church now stands, until 1685.

Unanswered questions
It is contested between scholars to what extent things were sites of economic transactions and commerce and arenas for political and legal decisions. In Norway, it is clear that the assemblies functioned as an administrative level for economic transactions and taxes to the king. The role of commerce at the thing is more undetermined in Iceland in particular because of the role of saga literature in influencing conclusions about things. Þingvellir was thought of as a trading place as a result of saga passages and law texts that refer to trade:

As shown in the Laxdæla saga, meetings at Þingvellir required people to travel from long distances and gather together for an extended period, thus it was inevitable that entertainment, food, tools, and other goods would have played a role in the gatherings. The main question is whether trade was conducted in the assembly or on the margins of the gathering. Similarly, there are unanswered questions about the connection between trade and assembly in Greenland. Research on Scandinavian trade and assembly is burgeoning, and thus far evidence has mostly been found in written sources, such as the sagas, and place names, ""such as the 'Disting' market that is said to have been held during the thing meetings at Gamla Uppsala in Sweden.""

National legislatures, current institutions and legal terms
The national legislatures of Iceland, Norway and Denmark all have names that incorporate thing:

Alþingi –  The Icelandic ""General Thing""
Folketing – The Danish ""People's Thing""
Storting – The Norwegian ""Great Thing""
The legislatures of the self-governing territories of Åland, Faroe Islands, Greenland and Isle of Man also have names that refer to thing:

Lagting – The Ålandic ""Law Thing""
Løgting – The Faeroese ""Law Thing""; also, the Faeroes are divided into six várting (administrative districts)
Landsting – The Greenlandic ""Land Thing""
Tynwald – The Manx ""Thing Meadow"" on the Isle of Man, formerly called ""Ting""
In addition, thing can be found in the name of the Swedish Assembly of Finland (Svenska Finlands folkting), a semi-official body representing the Finland Swedish, and those of the three distinct elected Sámi assemblies which are all called Sameting in Norwegian and Swedish (Northern Sami Sámediggi).
The Swedish national legislature, since medieval times, has borne a different style, Riksdag, which is cognate to the old name of the German national assembly, Reichstag. In Sweden, however, ting is used to name the subnational county councils, which are called Landsting. That name was also used in medieval times for the tings that governed the historical Landskap provinces, that were superseded by the counties in the 17th century. The name ting is also found in the names of the first level instances of the Swedish and Finnish court system, which are called tingsrätt (Finnish: käräjäoikeus), the 'court of the thing'.
Similarly, prior to 1953, the Danish legislature was known as Rigsdagen, which comprised the two houses of the Folketing ""People's Thing"" and Landsting ""Land Thing"". The latter, which was reserved for people of means, was abolished by the constitution of 1953.
The Norwegian parliament, the Storting, has historically been divided into two chambers named the Lagting and the Odelsting, which translates loosely into the ""Thing of the Law"" and the ""Thing of the Allodial rights"". However, for much of the Storting's recent history, the division into Lagting and Odelsting has been mostly ceremonial, and the Storting has generally operated as a unicameral parliament. A constitutional amendment passed in February 2007 abolished the Lagting and Odelsting, making this de facto unicameralism official following the 2009 election.
On the lower administrative level the governing bodies on the county level in Norway are called Fylkesting, the Thing of the County. The names of the judicial courts of Norway contain for the most part the affix ting. The primary level of courts is called the Tingrett, with the same meaning as the Swedish Tingsrätt, and four of the six Norwegian Courts of Appeal are named after historical Norwegian regional Things (Frostating, Gulating, Borgarting and Eidsivating).
In Dutch, the word geding refers to a lawsuit or trial, most noticeably with the term kort geding (literally: short thing) which refers to an injunction.

A regional commercial hub for central New Jersey, the city is both a college town (the main campus of Rutgers University, the state's largest university) and a commuter town for residents commuting to New York City within the New York metropolitan area. New Brunswick is on the Northeast Corridor rail line, 27 miles (43 km) southwest of Manhattan. The city is located on the southern banks of the Raritan River in the heart of the Raritan Valley region.
As of the 2020 United States census, the city's population was 55,266, an increase of 85 (+0.2%) from the 2010 census count of 55,181, which in turn reflected an increase of 6,608 (+13.6%) from the 48,573 counted in the 2000 census. The Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program calculated a population of 55,846 for 2023, making it the 719th-most populous municipality in the nation. Due to the concentration of medical facilities in the area, including Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and medical school, and Saint Peter's University Hospital, New Brunswick is known as both the Hub City and the Healthcare City. The corporate headquarters and production facilities of several global pharmaceutical companies are situated in the city, including Johnson & Johnson and Bristol Myers Squibb. New Brunswick has evolved into a major center for the sciences, arts, and cultural activities. Downtown New Brunswick is developing a growing skyline, filling in with new high-rise towers.
New Brunswick is noted for its ethnic diversity. At one time, one-quarter of the Hungarian population of New Jersey resided in the city, and in the 1930s one out of three city residents was Hungarian. The Hungarian community continues as a cohesive community, with the 3,200 Hungarian residents accounting for 8% of the population of New Brunswick in 1992.

A regional commercial hub for central New Jersey, the city is both a college town (the main campus of Rutgers University, the state's largest university) and a commuter town for residents commuting to New York City within the New York metropolitan area. New Brunswick is on the Northeast Corridor rail line, 27 miles (43 km) southwest of Manhattan. The city is located on the southern banks of the Raritan River in the heart of the Raritan Valley region.
As of the 2020 United States census, the city's population was 55,266, an increase of 85 (+0.2%) from the 2010 census count of 55,181, which in turn reflected an increase of 6,608 (+13.6%) from the 48,573 counted in the 2000 census. The Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program calculated a population of 55,846 for 2023, making it the 719th-most populous municipality in the nation. Due to the concentration of medical facilities in the area, including Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and medical school, and Saint Peter's University Hospital, New Brunswick is known as both the Hub City and the Healthcare City. The corporate headquarters and production facilities of several global pharmaceutical companies are situated in the city, including Johnson & Johnson and Bristol Myers Squibb. New Brunswick has evolved into a major center for the sciences, arts, and cultural activities. Downtown New Brunswick is developing a growing skyline, filling in with new high-rise towers.
New Brunswick is noted for its ethnic diversity. At one time, one-quarter of the Hungarian population of New Jersey resided in the city, and in the 1930s one out of three city residents was Hungarian.

History
Etymology
The area around present-day New Brunswick was first inhabited by the Lenape Native Americans, whose Minisink Trail intersected the Raritan River and followed a route that would be taken by later colonial roads. The first European settlement at the site of New Brunswick was made in 1681. The settlement here was called Prigmore's Swamp (1681–1697), then known as Inian's Ferry (1691–1714). In 1714, the settlement was given the name New Brunswick, after the city of Braunschweig (Brunswick in Low German), in the state of Lower Saxony, now located in Germany. Braunschweig was an influential and powerful city in the Hanseatic League and was an administrative seat for the Duchy of Hanover. Shortly after the first settlement of New Brunswick in colonial New Jersey, George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Elector of Hanover, became King George I of Great Britain. Alternatively, the city gets its name from King George II of Great Britain, the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg.

Colonial and Early American periods
Centrally located between New York City and Philadelphia along an early thoroughfare known as the King's Highway and situated along the Raritan River, New Brunswick became an important hub for Colonial travelers and traders. New Brunswick was incorporated as a town in 1736 and chartered as a city in 1784. It was incorporated into a town in 1798 as part of the Township Act of 1798. It was occupied by the British in the winter of 1776–1777 during the Revolutionary War.
The Declaration of Independence received one of its first public readings, by Colonel John Neilson in New Brunswick on July 9, 1776, in the days following its promulgation by the Continental Congress. A bronze statue marking the event was dedicated on July 9, 2017, in Monument Square, in front of the Heldrich Hotel.
The Trustees of Queen's College (now Rutgers University), founded in 1766, voted by a margin of ten to seven in 1771 to locate the young college in New Brunswick, selecting the city over Hackensack, in Bergen County, New Jersey. Classes began in 1771 with one instructor, one sophomore, Matthew Leydt, and several freshmen at a tavern called the 'Sign of the Red Lion' on the corner of Albany and Neilson Streets (now the grounds of the Johnson & Johnson corporate headquarters); Leydt would become the university's first graduate in 1774 when he was the only member of the graduating class. The Sign of the Red Lion was purchased on behalf of Queens College in 1771, and later sold to the estate of Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh in 1791. Classes were held through the American Revolution in various taverns and boarding houses, and at a building known as College Hall on George Street, until Old Queens was completed and opened in 1811. It remains the oldest building on the Rutgers University campus. The Queen's College Grammar School (now Rutgers Preparatory School) was established also in 1766, and shared facilities with the college until 1830, when it located in a building (now known as Alexander Johnston Hall) across College Avenue from Old Queens. After Rutgers University became the state university of New Jersey in 1945, the Trustees of Rutgers divested itself of Rutgers Preparatory School, which relocated in 1957 to an estate purchased from Colgate-Palmolive in Franklin Township in neighboring Somerset County.
The New Brunswick Theological Seminary, founded in 1784 in New York, moved to New Brunswick in 1810, sharing its quarters with the fledgling Queen's College. (Queen's closed from 1810 to 1825 due to financial problems, and reopened in 1825 as Rutgers College.) The Seminary, due to overcrowding and differences over the mission of Rutgers College as a secular institution, moved to a tract of land covering 7 acres (2.8 ha) located less than 1⁄2 mile (0.80 km) to the west, which it still occupies, although the land is now in the middle of Rutgers University's College Avenue Campus.
New Brunswick was formed by royal charter on December 30, 1730, within other townships in Middlesex and Somerset counties and was reformed by royal charter with the same boundaries on February 12, 1763, at which time it was divided into north and south wards. New Brunswick was incorporated as a city by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on September 1, 1784.

African-American community
Slavery in New Brunswick
The existence of an African American community in New Brunswick dates back to the 18th century, when racial slavery was a part of life in the city and the surrounding area. Local slaveholders routinely bought and sold African American children, women, and men in New Brunswick in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century. In this period, the Market-House was the center of commercial life in the city. It was located at the corner of Hiram Street and Queen Street (now Neilson Street) adjacent to the Raritan Wharf. The site was a place where residents of New Brunswick sold and traded their goods which made it an integral part of the city's economy. The Market-House also served as a site for regular slave auctions and sales.: 101 
By the late-eighteenth century, New Brunswick became a hub for newspaper production and distribution. The Fredonian, a popular newspaper, was located less than a block away from the aforementioned Market-House and helped facilitate commercial transactions. A prominent part of the local newspapers were sections dedicated to private owners who would advertise their slaves for sale. The trend of advertising slave sales in newspapers shows that the New Brunswick residents typically preferred selling and buying slaves privately and individually rather than in large groups.: 103  The majority of individual advertisements were for female slaves, and their average age at the time of the sale was 20 years old, which was considered the prime age for childbearing. Slave owners would get the most profit from the women who fit into this category because these women had the potential to reproduce another generation of enslaved workers. Additionally, in the urban environment of New Brunswick, there was a high demand for domestic labor, and female workers were preferred for cooking and housework tasks.: 107 
The New Jersey Legislature passed An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery in 1804. Under the provisions of this law, children born to enslaved women after July 4, 1804, would serve their master for a term of 21 years (for girls) or a term of 25 years (for boys), and after this term, they would gain their freedom. However, all individuals who were enslaved before July 4, 1804, would continue to be slaves for life and would never attain freedom under this law. New Brunswick continued to be home to enslaved African Americans alongside a growing community of free people of color. The 1810 United States census listed 53 free Blacks and 164 slaves in New Brunswick.

African American spaces and institutions in the early 19th century
By the 1810s, some free African Americans lived in a section of the city called Halfpenny Town, which was located along the Raritan River by the east side of the city, near Queen (now Neilson) Street. Halfpenny Town was a place populated by free blacks as well as poorer whites who did not own slaves. This place was known as a social gathering for free blacks that was not completely influenced by white scrutiny and allowed free blacks to socialize among themselves. This does not mean that it was free from white eyes and was still under the negative effects of the slavery era.: 99  In the early decades of the nineteenth century, White and either free or enslaved African Americans shared many of the same spaces in New Brunswick, particularly places of worship. The First Presbyterian Church, Christ Church, and First Reformed Church were popular among both Whites and Blacks, and New Brunswick was notable for its lack of spaces where African Americans could congregate exclusively. Most of the time Black congregants of these churches were under the surveillance of Whites.: 113  That was the case until the creation of the African Association of New Brunswick in 1817.: 114–115 
Both free and enslaved African Americans were active in the establishment of the African Association of New Brunswick, whose meetings were first held in 1817.: 112  The African Association of New Brunswick held a meeting every month, mostly in the homes of free blacks. Sometimes these meetings were held at the First Presbyterian Church. Originally intended to provide financial support for the African School of New Brunswick, the African Association grew into a space where blacks could congregate and share ideas on a variety of topics such as religion, abolition and colonization. Slaves were required to obtain a pass from their owner in order to attend these meetings. The African Association worked closely with Whites and was generally favored amongst White residents who believed it would bring more racial peace and harmony to New Brunswick.: 114–115 
The African Association of New Brunswick established the African School in 1822. The African School was first hosted in the home of Caesar Rappleyea in 1823.: 114  The school was located on the upper end of Church Street in the downtown area of New Brunswick about two blocks away from the jail that held escaped slaves. Both free and enslaved Blacks were welcome to be members of the School.: 116  Reverend Huntington (pastor of the First Presbyterian Church) and several other prominent Whites were trustees of the African Association of New Brunswick. These trustees supported the Association which made some slave owners feel safe sending their slaves there by using a permission slip process.: 115  The main belief of these White supporters was that Blacks were still unfit for American citizenship and residence, and some trustees were connected with the American Colonization Society that advocated for the migration of free African Americans to Africa. The White trustees only attended some of the meetings of the African Association, and the Association was still unprecedented as a space for both enslaved and free Blacks to get together while under minimal supervision by Whites.: 116–117 
The African Association appears to have disbanded after 1824. By 1827, free and enslaved Black people in the city, including Joseph and Jane Hoagland, came together to establish the Mount Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church and purchased a plot of land on Division Street for the purpose of erecting a church building. This was the first African American church in Middlesex County. The church had approximately 30 members in its early years. The church is still in operation and is currently located at 39 Hildebrand Way. The street Hildebrand Way is named after the late Rev. Henry Alphonso Hildebrand, who was pastor of Mount Zion AME for 37 years, which is the longest appointment received by a pastor at Mount Zion AME.
Records from the April 1828 census, conducted by the New Brunswick Common Council, state that New Brunswick was populated with 4,435 white residents and 374 free African Americans. The enslaved population of New Brunswick in 1828 consisted of 57 slaves who must serve for life and 127 slaves eligible for emancipation at age 21 or 25 due to the 1804 Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery. Free and enslaved African Americans accounted for 11% of New Brunswick's population in 1828, a relatively high percentage for New Jersey.: 94  By comparison, as of the 1830 United States census, African Americans made up approximately 6.4% of the total population of New Jersey.

Jail and curfew in the 19th century
In 1824, the New Brunswick Common Council adopted a curfew for free people of color. Free African Americans were not allowed to be out after 10 pm on Saturday night. The Common Council also appointed a committee of white residents who were charged with rounding up and detaining free African Americans who appeared to be out of place according to white authorities.: 98 
New Brunswick became a notorious city for slave hunters, who sought to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Strategically located on the Raritan River, the city was also a vital hub for New Jersey's Underground Railroad. For runaway slaves in New Jersey, it served as a favorable route for those heading to New York and Canada. When African Americans tried to escape either to or from New Brunswick, they had a high likelihood of getting discovered and captured and sent to New Brunswick's jail, which was located on Prince Street, which by now is renamed Bayard Street.: 96

Hungarian community
New Brunswick has been described as the nation's ""most Hungarian city"", with Hungarian immigrants arriving in the city as early as 1888 and accounting for almost 20% of the city's population in 1915. Hungarians were primarily attracted to the city by employment at Johnson & Johnson factories located in the city. Hungarians settled mainly in what today is the Fifth Ward and businesses were established to serve the needs of the Hungarian community that weren't being met by mainstream businesses. The immigrant population grew until the end of the immigration boom in the early 20th century.
During the Cold War, the community was revitalized by the decision to process the tens of thousands refugees who came to the United States from the failed 1956 Hungarian Revolution at Camp Kilmer, in nearby Edison. Even though the Hungarian population has been largely supplanted by newer immigrants, there continues to be a Hungarian Festival in the city held on Somerset Street on the first Saturday of June each year; the 44th annual event was held in 2019. Many Hungarian institutions set up by the community remain and are active in the neighborhood, including: Magyar Reformed Church, Ascension Lutheran Church, St. Ladislaus Roman Catholic Church, St. Joseph Byzantine Catholic Church, Hungarian American Athletic Club, Aprokfalva Montessori Preschool, Széchenyi Hungarian Community School & Kindergarten, Teleki Pál Scout Home, Hungarian American Foundation, Vers Hangja, Hungarian Poetry Group, Bolyai Lecture Series on Arts and Sciences, Hungarian Alumni Association, Hungarian Radio Program, Hungarian Civic Association, Committee of Hungarian Churches and Organizations of New Brunswick, and Csűrdöngölő Folk Dance Ensemble.
Several landmarks in the city also testify to its Hungarian heritage. There is a street and a park named after Lajos Kossuth, one of the leaders of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. The corner of Somerset Street and Plum Street is named Mindszenty Square where the first ever statue of Cardinal József Mindszenty was erected. A stone memorial to the victims of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution stands nearby.

Latino community
In the 2010 Census, about 50% of New Brunswick's population is self-identified as Hispanic, the 14th highest percentage among municipalities in New Jersey. Since the 1960s, many of the new residents of New Brunswick have come from Latin America. Many citizens moved from Puerto Rico in the 1970s. In the 1980s, many immigrated from the Dominican Republic, and still later from Guatemala, Honduras, Ecuador and Mexico.

Demolition, revitalization, and redevelopment
New Brunswick is one of nine cities in New Jersey designated as eligible for Urban Transit Hub Tax Credits by the state's Economic Development Authority. Developers who invest a minimum of $50 million within a half-mile of a train station are eligible for pro-rated tax credit.
New Brunswick contains a number of examples of urban renewal in the United States. In the 1960s–1970s, the downtown area experienced urban decay as middle class residents moved to newer suburbs surrounding the city, an example of the phenomenon known as ""white flight."" Beginning in 1975, Rutgers University, Johnson & Johnson and the city's government collaborated through the New Jersey Economic Development Authority to form the New Brunswick Development Company (DevCo), with the goal of revitalizing the city center and redeveloping neighborhoods considered to be blighted and dangerous (via demolition of existing buildings and construction of new ones). Johnson & Johnson announced in 1978 that they would remain in New Brunswick and invest $50 million to build a new world headquarters building in the area between Albany Street, Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, Route 18, and George Street, requiring many old buildings and historic roads to be removed. The Hiram Market area, a historic district that by the 1970s had become a mostly Puerto Rican and Dominican-American neighborhood, was demolished to build a Hyatt hotel and conference center, and upscale housing. Johnson & Johnson guaranteed the investment made by Hyatt Hotels, as they were wary of building an upscale hotel in a run-down area.
Devco, the hospitals, and the city government have drawn ire from both historic preservationists, those opposing gentrification and those concerned with eminent domain abuses and tax abatements for developers.
New Brunswick is home to the main campus of Rutgers University and Johnson & Johnson, which in 1983 constructed its new headquarters in the city. Both work with Devco in a public–private partnership to redevelop downtown, particularly regarding transit-oriented development. Boraie Development, a real estate development firm based in New Brunswick, has developed projects using the incentives provided by Devco and the state.

Tallest buildings
Christ Church, originally built in 1742, was the tallest building at the time of construction. A steeple was added in 1773 and replaced in 1803. The six-story First Reformed Church, built in 1812, was long the city's tallest structure. One of the earliest tall commercial buildings in the city was the eight-story 112.5 ft (34.29 m) National Bank of New Jersey built in 1908. The four nine-story 125 ft (38 m) buildings of the New Brunswick Homes housing project, originally built in 1958, were demolished by implosion in 2000 and largely replaced by low-rise housing.
While there are no buildings over 300 feet (91 meters), since the beginning of the new millennium, a number of high-rise residential buildings have been added to the city's skyline. clustered around the New Brunswick station have joined those built in the 1960s on the city's skyline. Of the 16 buildings over 150 feet (46 m), nine of them were built in the 21st century; several others are approved or proposed.

As the legislative body of New Brunswick's municipal government, the City Council is responsible for approving the annual budget, ordinances and resolutions, contracts, and appointments to boards and commissions. The Council President is elected to a two-year term by the members of the Council at a reorganization meeting held after election and presides over all meetings.

Emergency services
Police department
The New Brunswick Police Department has received attention for various incidents over the years. In 1991, the fatal shooting of Shaun Potts, an unarmed black resident, by Sergeant Zane Grey led to multiple local protests. In 1996, Officer James Consalvo fatally shot Carolyn ""Sissy"" Adams, an unarmed prostitute who had bit him. The Adams case sparked calls for reform in the New Brunswick Police Department, and ultimately was settled with the family. Two officers, Sgt. Marco Chinchilla and Det. James Marshall, were convicted of running a bordello in 2001. Chinchilla was sentenced to three years and Marshall was sentenced to four. In 2011, Officer Brad Berdel fatally shot Barry Deloatch, a black man who had run from police (although police claim he struck officers with a stick); this sparked daily protests from residents.
Following the Deloatch shooting, sergeant Richard Rowe was formally charged with mishandling 81 Internal Affairs investigations; Mayor Cahill explained that this would help ""rebuild the public's trust and confidence in local law enforcement.""

Fire department
The current professional city fire department was established in 1914, but the earliest volunteer fire company in the city dates back to 1764. The department operates out of three stations, with a total of approximately 90 officers and firefighters.

In total, they are the second largest ethnic group in Indianapolis.","Those of Irish ancestry have had a strong impact on the city of Indianapolis, Indiana.  In total, they are the second largest ethnic group in Indianapolis.

Antebellum
Most of the Irish immigrants to Indianapolis settled originally on east coast cities, but gradually moved westward to find better employment opportunities.  With internal improvements seen as one way toward development in 1832, the Indianapolis newspaper Indiana Journal advertised for Irish workers to come work for the Wabash and Erie Canal, enticing them with $10 a month wages and cheap land.  The Mammoth Internal Improvement Act defined the expectation of several Irish workers being available to work on such projects as the Indiana Central Canal and the National Road.  However, once the Panic of 1837 struck, many Irish became unemployed.
The 1840s saw the Irish begin to form small communities within the city, especially in the same poorer areas that free blacks resided.  They created what would become St. John Catholic Church in 1840, after celebrating their first Catholic Mass in 1837 at a tavern on West Washington Street.  Greater numbers of Irish came during the decade due to the Great Famine of Ireland, and relief efforts were started by the Indianapolis Irish to support those still in Ireland.

War years
At the start of the War, the Irish in Indianapolis mostly resided at Irish Hill, which gained a reputation as the toughest part of town, and Fountain Square.  These areas tended to be next to railroad and streetcar lines, which relied on Irish workers.  Other major employers of the Irish were construction and pork-packing.
At the start of the War, the Indianapolis Irish formed the 35th Regiment, also called the 1st Irish Regiment, recruited at the parish school of St. John's.  They would later be combined with the 61st Regiment/2nd Irish Regiment.  Some of the Irish, particularly those that belonged to the Irish Republican Brotherhood (Fenians)  thought the War would be good practice for eventually fighting Great Britain. Two rival chapters of the Fenians in Indianapolis recruited 150 Irish veterans to invade Canada from Buffalo, New York, in hopes of severing Canada from Great Britain in May 1866.  All Fenians who attempted this, including the 150 from Indianapolis, were arrested under orders of President Andrew Johnson on June 6, 1866.

Post-war
By 1870, Indianapolis was the home of over 3,300 foreign-born Irish, with the  total being 3,760 for all of Marion County.  This saw the Irish attain greater political power in Indianapolis local affairs.  Although the first two Irish mayors of Indianapolis, John Caven and Daniel MaCauley, were of the Republican Party, as a whole the Irish of Indianapolis sides with the Democrats, especially since the Republicans were the party of blacks, and Irish were opposed to them.  This led to a racial riot on May 3, 1876, when in response to Irish Democrats intimidating black voters in Ward 6, a base of Irish Democrats in Indianapolis, 100 blacks from Ward 4 went to Ward 6, seizing hockey sticks to attack the Irish intimidators.  The crowd was eventually dispersed by the city police and Mayor Caven, but not after gunfire was begun.  Several blacks were injured, with one dying due to the riot.  It was the worst in the city's history.

1900s
In 1910 the Irish population in Indianapolis was 12,225, of which 3,255 were born in Ireland, composing 5% of the total population of Indianapolis, and 15% of its immigrant population.  During World War I the Irish would side with the city's German population in denouncing the Allies, due to their hatred of Great Britain.

Today
An annual event called the Indy Irish Fest occurs every September.  On St. Patrick's Day, not only is there a parade, but the Indiana Central Canal is dyed green to celebrate the holiday.
There are also the Irish Dancers of Indianapolis, that celebrate the dancing of Ireland.

He became an American legend while still alive, due to his kind, generous ways, his leadership in conservation, and the symbolic importance that he attributed to apples. He was the inspiration for many museums and historical sites such as the Johnny Appleseed Museum in Urbana, Ohio.

Family
Chapman was born on September 26, 1774, in Leominster, Province of Massachusetts Bay, the second child of Nathaniel and Elizabeth Chapman (née Simonds, married February 8, 1770). His birthplace has a granite marker, and the street is now called Johnny Appleseed Lane.
Chapman's mother Elizabeth died in 1776, shortly after giving birth to her second son Nathaniel Jr., who died a few days later. In 1780, his father Nathaniel returned to Longmeadow, Massachusetts where he married Lucy Cooley.
Author Rosella Rice states, ""Johnny had one sister, Persis Broom, of Indiana. She was not at all like him; a very ordinary woman, talkative, and free in her frequent, 'says she's' and 'says I's.'""
According to some accounts, 18-year-old John persuaded his 11-year-old half-brother Nathaniel Cooley Chapman to go west with him in 1792. The duo apparently lived a nomadic life until their father brought his large family west in 1805 and met up with them in Ohio. Nathaniel decided to stay and help their father farm the land.
Shortly after the brothers parted ways, John began his apprenticeship as an orchardist under a Mr. Crawford who grew apples, thus inspiring Chapman's life journey of planting apple trees. In 1800 at age 26, Chapman was in Licking River, Ohio. His first orchard was on the farm of Isaac Stadden in Licking County. In 1806, he embarked upon a canoe voyage down the Ohio, Muskingum, and Walhonding Rivers, using two canoes lashed together to transport himself and his seeds.

Life
There are stories of Johnny Appleseed practicing his nurseryman craft in the area of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, and of picking seeds from the pomace at Potomac River cider mills in the late 1790s. Another story has Chapman living in Pittsburgh on Grant's Hill in 1794 at the time of the Whiskey Rebellion.
The popular image is of Johnny Appleseed spreading apple seeds randomly everywhere he went. In fact, he planted nurseries rather than orchards, built fences around them to protect them from livestock and wildlife, left the nurseries in the care of a neighbor who sold trees on shares, and returned every year or two to tend the nursery. He planted his first nursery on the bank of Brokenstraw Creek, south of Warren, Pennsylvania. Next, he seems to have moved to Venango County, along the shore of French Creek, but many of these nurseries were in the Mohican River area of north-central Ohio. This area included the towns of Mansfield, Lisbon, Lucas, Perrysville and Loudonville.
In 1817, a bulletin of the Church of New Jerusalem printed in Manchester, England was the first to publish a written report about Chapman. It described a missionary who traveled around the West to sow apple seeds and pass out books of The New Church.
In 1819, Chapman was nearly killed in an accident in Ohio. One morning, he was picking his crops in a tree when he fell and caught his neck in the fork of the branches. Shortly after he fell, eight year-old John White found him struggling. White cut the tree down, saving Chapman's life.
In 1822, the first known use of ""John Appleseed"" was written in a letter from a member of the New Church.
According to Harper's New Monthly Magazine, toward the end of his career he was present when an itinerant missionary was exhorting an open-air congregation in Mansfield, Ohio. The sermon was long and severe on the topic of extravagance, because the pioneers were buying such indulgences as calico and imported tea. ""Where now is there a man who, like the primitive Christians, is traveling to heaven barefooted and clad in coarse raiment?"" the preacher repeatedly asked, until Johnny Appleseed walked up to him, put his bare foot on the stump that had served as a pulpit, and said, ""Here's your primitive Christian!""

Author Rosella Rice met Chapman in his later years, and she stated in the 1863 History of Ashland County, Ohio:His personal appearance was as singular as his character. He was a small, ""chunked"" man, quick and restless in his motions and conversation; his beard, though not long, was unshaven, and his hair was long and dark, and his eye black and sparkling. He lived the roughest life, and often slept in the woods. His clothing was mostly old, being generally given to him in exchange for apple-trees. He went bare-footed, and often traveled miles through the snow in that way.... [He] wore on his head a tin utensil which answered both as a cap and a mush pot.
Historian Paul Aron argues, ""Chapman was actually a successful businessman. He bought many of the parcels of land on which he planted his seeds and ultimately accumulated about twelve hundred acres across three states.... He wore pauper's clothing by choice and not out of necessity.""
Chapman would tell stories to children and spread New Church teachings to the adults, receiving in return a floor to sleep on for the night, and sometimes supper. Rice stated, ""We can hear him read now, just as he did that summer day, when we were busy quilting upstairs, and he lay near the door, his voice rising denunciatory and thrilling—strong and loud as the roar of wind and waves, then soft and soothing as the balmy airs that quivered the morning-glory leaves about his gray beard. His was a strange eloquence at times, and he was undoubtedly a man of genius.""
Chapman cared deeply about animals, including insects. Henry Howe visited all the counties in Ohio in the early nineteenth century and collected several stories from the 1830s, when Johnny Appleseed was still alive:

One cool autumnal night, while lying by his camp-fire in the woods, he observed that the mosquitoes flew in the blaze and were burned. Johnny, who wore on his head a tin utensil which answered both as a cap and a mush pot, filled it with water and quenched the fire, and afterwards remarked, ""God forbid that I should build a fire for my comfort, that should be the means of destroying any of His creatures.""
Another time, he allegedly made a camp-fire in a snowstorm at the end of a hollow log in which he intended to pass the night, but he found it occupied by a bear and cubs, so he removed his fire to the other end and slept on the snow in the open air, rather than disturb the bear.
In a story collected by Eric Braun, he had a pet wolf that had started following him after he healed its injured leg.
More controversially, he also planted dogfennel during his travels, believing that it was a useful medicinal herb. Although it is native to the southern and eastern United States, it spreads aggressively and can be difficult to manage.
According to another story, he heard that a horse was to be put down, so he bought the horse, bought a few grassy acres nearby, and turned it out to recover. When it did, he gave the horse to someone needy, exacting a promise to treat it humanely.
During his later life, he was a vegetarian. Chapman chose not to marry, as he believed that he would find his soulmate in Heaven if she did not appear to him on Earth.

Death
Different dates are listed for his death. Harper's New Monthly Magazine of November 1871 was apparently incorrect in saying that he died in mid-1847, though this is taken by many as the primary source of information about John Chapman. Multiple Indiana newspapers reported his death date as March 18, 1845. The Goshen Democrat published a death notice for him in its March 27, 1845, edition, citing the day of death as March 18 of that year. The paper's death notice read:

In Fort Wayne, on Tuesday, 18th, inst John Chapman, commonly known by the name of Johnny Appleseed, about 70 years of age. Many of our citizens will remember this eccentric individual, as he sauntered through town eating his dry rusk and cold meat, and freely conversing on the mysteries of his religious faith. He was a devoted follower of Emanuel Swedenborg, and notwithstanding his apparent poverty, was reputed to be in good circumstances.
The Fort Wayne Sentinel printed his obituary on March 22, 1845, saying that he died on March 18:

On the same day in this neighborhood, at an advanced age, Mr. John Chapman (better known as Johnny Appleseed).
The deceased was well known through this region by his eccentricity, and the strange garb he usually wore. He followed the occupation of a nurseryman, and has been a regular visitor here upwards of 10 years. He was a native of Pennsylvania we understand but his home—if home he had—for some years past was in the neighborhood of Cleveland, where he has relatives living. He is supposed to have considerable property, yet denied himself almost the common necessities of life—not so much perhaps for avarice as from his peculiar notions on religious subjects. He was a follower of Swedenborg and devoutly believed that the more he endured in this world the less he would have to suffer and the greater would be his happiness hereafter—he submitted to every privation with cheerfulness and content, believing that in so doing he was securing snug quarters hereafter.
In the most inclement weather he might be seen barefooted and almost naked except when he chanced to pick up articles of old clothing. Notwithstanding the privations and exposure he endured, he lived to an extreme old age, not less than 80 years at the time of his death—though no person would have judged from his appearance that he was 60. He always carried with him some work on the doctrines of Swedenborg with which he was perfectly familiar, and would readily converse and argue on his tenets, using much shrewdness and penetration.

His death was quite sudden. He was seen on our streets a day or two previous.
Rosella Rice wrote in 1863:He died near Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1846 or 1848, a stranger among strangers, who kindly cared for him. He died the death of the righteous, calmly and peacefully, and with little suffering or pain. So long as his memory lives will a grateful people say: ""He went about doing good.""The site of his grave is also disputed. Developers of the Canterbury Green apartment complex and golf course in Fort Wayne, Indiana, claim that his grave is there, marked by a rock. That is where the Worth cabin sat in which he died. 
Steven Fortriede, director of the Allen County Public Library (ACPL) and author of the 1978 Johnny Appleseed, believes that another gravesite is the correct site, in Johnny Appleseed Park in Fort Wayne. Johnny Appleseed Park is a Fort Wayne city park that adjoins Archer Park, an Allen County park. Archer Park is the site of John Chapman's grave marker and used to be a part of the Archer family farm.
The Worth family attended First Baptist Church in Fort Wayne, according to records at ACPL. According to an 1858 interview with Richard Worth Jr., Chapman was buried ""respectably"" in the Archer cemetery, and Fortriede believes that use of the term ""respectably"" indicates that Chapman was buried in the hallowed ground of Archer cemetery instead of near the cabin where he died.
John H. Archer, grandson of David Archer, wrote in a letter dated October 4, 1900:

The historical account of his death and burial by the Worths and their neighbors, the Pettits, Goinges, Porters, Notestems, Parkers, Beckets, Whitesides, Pechons, Hatfields, Parrants, Ballards, Randsells, and the Archers in David Archer's private burial grounds is substantially correct. The grave, more especially the common head-boards used in those days, have long since decayed and become entirely obliterated, and at this time I do not think that any person could with any degree of certainty come within fifty feet of pointing out the location of his grave. Suffice it to say that he has been gathered in with his neighbors and friends, as I have enumerated, for the majority of them lie in David Archer's graveyard with him.
In 1934, a committee of the Johnny Appleseed Commission Council of the City of Fort Wayne reported, ""[A]s a part of the celebration of Indiana's 100th birthday in 1916 an iron fence was placed in the Archer graveyard by the Horticulture Society of Indiana setting off the grave of Johnny Appleseed. At that time, there were men living who had attended the funeral of Johnny Appleseed. Direct and accurate evidence was available then. There was little or no reason for them to make a mistake about the location of this grave. They located the grave in the Archer burying ground.""

Legacy
Johnny Appleseed left an estate of over 1,200 acres (490 ha) of valuable nurseries to his sister. He also owned four plots in Allen County, Indiana, including a nursery in Milan Township with 15,000 trees, and two plots in Mount Vernon, Ohio. He bought the southwest quarter (160 acres; 65 ha) of section 26, Mohican Township, Ashland County, Ohio, but did not record the deed and lost the property.
The financial panic of 1837 took a toll on his estate. Trees brought only two or three cents each, as opposed to the ""fippenny bit"" (about six and a quarter cents) that he usually got. Some of his land was sold to pay taxes following his death, and litigation used up much of the rest.
In 1880, abolitionist author Lydia Maria Child mythologized Appleseed in a poem:

In 1921, 1923, 1927, and 1928, American song poet Vachel Lindsay published poems about Johnny Appleseed. One of these poems was the source text for Eunice Lea Kettering's prize-winning choral-orchestral composition Johnny Appleseed. Gail Kubik composed a work for bass, chorus and orchestra called In Praise of Johnny Appleseed; this work was also based on the eponymous Vachel Lindsay poem, and entered into the same 1942 National Federation of Music Clubs composition competition as Kettering's work.
In 1933, poets Rosemary Carr Benét and Stephen Vincent Benét mythologized Appleseed in their children's poetry book A Book of Americans.
In Disney's 1948 film Melody Time, Appleseed is featured in an animated musical segment titled ""The Legend of Johnny Appleseed"".
The first recorded Johnny Appleseed Festival was held in 1968 in Lisbon, Ohio. The festival takes place the third weekend of September in downtown with food and entertainment taking up just over 2 square blocks. Amusement rides are among the 100+ vendors and attractions. Since 1975 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the Johnny Appleseed Festival has been held the third full weekend in September in Johnny Appleseed Park and in Archer Park. Musicians, demonstrators, and vendors dress in early-19th-century attire and offer food and beverages that would have been available then. Similar festivals are held in Sheffield, PA; Apple Creek, OH; Crystal Lake, IL; Lisbon, OH; and Paradise, CA.
In 2008, the Fort Wayne Wizards, a minor-league baseball club, changed their name to the Fort Wayne TinCaps. In their first season with the new name (2009), the Tincaps won their only league championship. The name ""Tincaps"" refers to the tin hat (or pot) which Johnny Appleseed allegedly wore. The team mascot is named ""Johnny"".
From 1962 to 1980, a high school athletic league made up of schools from around the Mansfield, Ohio, area used the name the ""Johnny Appleseed Conference"".
In 1966, the U.S. Postal Service issued a five-cent stamp commemorating Johnny Appleseed.
A memorial in Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati, Ohio, stands on the summit of the grounds in Section 134. A circular garden surrounds a large stone upon which a bronze statue of Chapman stands, face looking skywards, holding an apple-seedling tree in one hand and a book in the other. A bronze cenotaph identifies him as Johnny Appleseed and gives a brief biography and eulogy.
A bronze statue of Chapman sits on a bench on Jefferson Boulevard in Fort Wayne, Indiana, offering a red apple to visitors who sit beside him. Unveiled in 2020, the sculpture was created by Gary Tillery.
March 11 and September 26 are sometimes celebrated as Johnny Appleseed Day. The September date is Appleseed's acknowledged birthdate, but the March date is sometimes preferred because it falls during planting season.
Johnny Appleseed Elementary School is a public school in Leominster, Massachusetts, his birthplace. Mansfield, Ohio, one of Appleseed's stops in his peregrinations, was home to Johnny Appleseed Middle School until it closed in 1989.
In 1984, Jill and Michael Gallina published a biographical musical, Johnny Appleseed.
In 2016, John Chapman appeared in Tracy Chevalier's historical fiction novel At the Edge of the Orchard.
A large terracotta sculpture of Johnny Appleseed, created by Viktor Schreckengost (1906–2008), adorns the front of the Lakewood High School Civic Auditorium in Lakewood, Ohio. Although the local board of education deemed Appleseed too ""eccentric"" a figure to grace the front of the building (renaming the sculpture simply ""Early Settler""), students, teachers, and parents alike still call the sculpture by its intended name: ""Johnny Appleseed"".
Apple uses John and Jane Appleseed as generic name, in a reference to Johnny.
Urbana University in Urbana, Ohio, maintains one of two Johnny Appleseed museums in the world, which is open to the public. The Johnny Appleseed Educational Center and  Museum hosts a number of artifacts, as well as trees that are descended from the same trees originally planted by Johnny Appleseed. They also provide a number of services for research, including a national registry of Johnny Appleseed's relatives. In 2011, the museum was renovated and updated.  The educational center and museum was founded on the belief that those who have the opportunity to study the life of Johnny Appleseed will share his appreciation of education, his country, the environment, peace, moral integrity, and leadership.
Supposedly, the only surviving tree planted by Johnny Appleseed grows on the farm of Richard and Phyllis Algeo of Nova, Ohio. Some marketers claim that it is a Rambo; some even make the claim that the Rambo was ""Johnny Appleseed's favorite variety"", ignoring the fact that he had religious objections to grafting and preferred wild apples to all named varieties. It appears that most nurseries are calling the tree the ""Johnny Appleseed"" variety, rather than a Rambo. Unlike the mid-summer Rambo, the Johnny Appleseed variety ripens in September and is a baking-applesauce variety similar to an Albemarle Pippin. Nurseries offer the Johnny Appleseed tree as an immature apple tree for planting, with scions from the Algeo stock grafted on them.
Orchardists do not appear to be marketing the fruit of this tree.

Hard cider
Chapman planted his apples by seed, not grafting, but without grafting, about one in a hundred seedlings will yield an apple that is edible as a fruit. According to Henry David Thoreau, an apple grown from seed tastes ""sour enough to set a squirrel's teeth on edge and make a jay scream."" But apples from seed are perfectly fine for making hard cider, and in the early part of the nineteenth century, there was a demand for hard cider—Ohioans ages fifteen and over drank, on average, thirty gallons of hard cider per year (10.52 ounces per day). Author Michael Pollan believes that since Chapman was against grafting and thus virtually all his apples were not edible and could be used only for cider: ""Really, what Johnny Appleseed was doing and the reason he was welcome in every cabin in Ohio and Indiana was he was bringing the gift of alcohol to the frontier. He was our American Dionysus.""

History
At the February 1966 meeting of the Clinton Lions Club, a proposal was made to build an attractive planter at Elm and Water Streets. This spot was then occupied by a road barrier; when a new Wabash River bridge was built a short distance to the south, the barrier had been erected to prevent drivers from using the old roadway. A first project estimate was set at approximately $300 and a committee named to investigate the possibilities.  At about the same time, an area television station asked the Clinton Chamber of Commerce to submit a representative photograph that could be used on broadcasts to community at a glance.  A photographer from Daily Clintonian was asked to provide the image, and because he was also a member of the Lions Club project committee, he prompted the publication of several newspaper articles citing Clinton's lack of identity and urging cooperation with the Lions' proposed project.  Readers responded with a variety of suggestions, which included connections with the city's history of coal mining and its current wealth of Italian restaurants. Members of the Lions' committee considered the various proposals, chose an Italian theme, and decided to abandon the planter idea; to them, the Italian theme seemed natural because a neighborhood in the city's north had been heavily Italian earlier in the city's history. As the Lions began to prepare for the festival, they invited representatives of other local organizations to participate, and approximately thirty groups were represented at the next planning meeting. Amid sketches of suggested fountains, planters, speaker-band platforms, and general Old World scenic settings, the delegates chose the name ""Project LIFT""; the latter word was meant to be an acronym for ""Little Italy Festival Town"" as well as indicating the delegates' hope that the festival would give their community a lift.  Soon after this meeting, the group incorporated as ""LIFT, Inc."" The festival has endured into the 2010s; annual attendance typically varies between sixty thousand and eighty thousand.
The festival went on hiatus in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and plans to return the next year.

Landmarks
Immigrant Square is a square created to represent those who have immigrated to Clinton. In 1973, the statue of a man, who Joe Airola called Luigi, was created. Later, a coal fountain was constructed in front of Luigi. The Bull's head, also called Il Toro, is a drinking fountain created by Joe Airola. Joe envisioned this statue and with the help of his brother-in-law presented the concept to the Mayor of Turin. Airola felt that the bull was a symbol of Turin, a major city located in the Piedmont area in northern Italy. 
Little Italian House also known as La Piccolla Casa is a house that was believed to have been built in 1921. The Ricauda family owned the house from 1923 to 1971. It was then sold to Joseph P. Beno. In 1979, The L.I.F.T. committee purchased the house. Martha Costello's efforts to preserve the house led to it being open to the public in 1979. The house features a garden, Italian immigrant photos, furniture and household products.

The theme of the 2025 NJFF is: “50th Anniversary—Celebrating New Jersey.”

Background
The NJFF is a free, non-profit, family event held every year on the last Saturday in April from 10am - 4pm, rain or shine. It coincides with Rutgers Agricultural Field Day held on the adjacent Cook Campus as part of Rutgers Day. Traditionally held on the Great Lawn at the Wood Lawn mansion, home to the Eagleton Institute of Politics, in 2024 it moved to the lawn in the vicinity of the Passion Puddle.
Established in 1975, the New Jersey Folk Festival is the oldest continuously run folk festival inthe State of New Jersey and believed to be one of the oldest festivals of its type in the United States. The festival attracts over 10,000 people and is one of the City of New Brunswick's largest regularly scheduled events. The NJFF is also one of the largest, outdoor annual cultural events in the state of New Jersey.
Typically, the event features stages and tents of music, dance, and workshops, a children's activities area, a delicious array of food choices that offers everything from hamburgers, vegetarian fare, and funnel cake to a wide variety of ethnic foods, a folk marketplace, and a heritage area which offers a close-up look at each year's cultural or geographical theme or other appropriate exhibits.
The 2025 festival is being organized and sponsored by the executive board of the New Jersey Folk Festival Inc., in a partnership with the Rutgers University Collaborative Center for Community Engagement, led by Brian Patrick Kurisky, Ph.D. The New Jersey Folk Festival Inc. is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in the State of New Jersey exempt from federal taxation.

History and mission
The mission of the New Jersey Folk Festival is to preserve and protect the music, culture, and arts of New Jersey. Therefore, the main focus of this festival is the traditional music, crafts, and foods of the diverse ethnic and cultural communities within the state and its surrounding region.
Each year the festival strives for diversity in selecting performers, not only seeking out traditional ""American"" artists, but also reaching out via fieldwork to the many ethnic communities found within New Jersey. The annual ethnic or regional feature contributes an essential intimate connection to these varied cultural groups represented in the state's population.
The New Jersey Folk Festival is professionally supervised by Dr. Maria Kennedy and Co-Directors Dr. Carla Cevasco and Matt Hueston. It was founded by Dr. Angus Kress Gillespie. Each year also sees a Student Intern Team in positions including Stage Management, Outreach, Communications, Logistics, Curatorial Programs, Artists Relations, and more.

A student-run event
This festival is the product of a class intended, in part, to provide students with leadership opportunities. The festival is one of only a handful in the United States managed by undergraduate students. Collectively, the staff is responsible for continuing the festival's mission of celebrating the diverse multicultural and indigenous folk life of New Jersey.
In 1975, when the festival first began, only two students were involved in its organization and management. Today, about ten students serve on the planning committee. Alumni of the festival also serve as advisors to the committee.
The class meets for three hours once a week under the direction of faculty advisor Dr. Maria Kennedy. During the first half of the class, there is academic instruction in which the students learn about folklore, including the distinction between ""traditional"" versus ""revival"" folk music, theoretical problems associated with publicly presenting ethnic culture, the history and aesthetic sensibilities of the craft presenters and performers, as well as more practical instruction in how to write press releases or conduct radio interviews. The second half of the class functions as a business meeting led by the festival manager, complete with progress reports from coordinators, ""breakaway"" management teamwork sessions, and problem-solving.
The student coordinators form a closely knit team, where they develop leadership and management skills, written and verbal communication, organization, personal assertiveness, and time management. The class is part of the curriculum of the American Studies Department of Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.

Festival logo
The Jersey Devil serves as the official logo of the New Jersey Folk Festival. However, every year, a new logo embodying the current year's festival highlight is designed and used.

Original logo
The original festival logo was the rooster. Back in 1975, the festival was managed by three people; Professor Gillespie as the Director, Kathy DeAngelo as the music coordinator, and Barbara Irwin as the crafts coordinator. When choosing a logo, the original committee turned to the folk art collection of the Newark Museum of Art. There they found the cock weathervane made of copper in 19th century rural New Jersey. They felt that this rooster served as a fine symbol of the folk culture found in New Jersey in earlier days.
Erwin Christensen in The Index of American Design explains that the rooster is probably the earliest weathervane design in the United States. This preference may be explained by the widespread use of this symbol on church steeples in Europe. According to tradition, the cock owed its place on church spires to Peter's denial of Christ. Hence, it served as a warning to the congregation not to do the same. In the Bayeux Tapestry of the 1070s, originally of the Bayeux Cathedral (Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Bayeux) and now exhibited at Musée de la Tapisserie de Bayeux in Bayeux, Normandy, there is a depiction of a man installing a cock on Westminster Abbey. Also it is reputed through Papal enactment that in the 9th century Pope Nicholas I ordered the figure to be placed on every church steeple and even previous to that Pope Leo IV had it placed on the Old St. Peter's Basilica or old Constantinian basilica even before Nicholas I was Pope.

Background
In 1962, Olaf Lambert, the manager of the Royal Orleans Hotel in the French Quarter contacted George Wein, a jazz mogul and founder of the Newport Jazz Festival and the Newport Folk Festival in Rhode Island and asked him to bring his festival model to New Orleans. Wein met with Mayor Victor H. Schiro, Seymour Weiss a hotel executive and civic leader, and a few members of the New Orleans Chamber of Commerce to discuss the proposition. They decided that New Orleans and the South were not ready for a jazz festival. It was a time in the city's history that was fraught with racism and segregationists reminiscent of the Jim Crow era. City ordinances were still in place that prohibited interaction between black and white musicians, tourists and locals and prevented revitalization of the economy in this manner.
Two years after their initial meeting, Lambert again contacted George Wein and asked him to plan what was to be called the New Orleans International Jazz Festival for the spring of 1965. Racial tensions were on the rise, and the non-profit community effort was postponed because of ""integration tensions"". In the meantime, the proposed Annual New Orleans International Jazz Festival moved ahead under the auspices of attorney Dean A. Andrews Jr. Community organizations such as the New Orleans Jazz Club were not invited, and the event failed to attract big names, which Andrews claimed was by design. ""Our idea is not to bring in big-time musicians. We want to tell the story of the New Orleans sound, to show the evolution of New Orleans jazz.""
In 1967, Durel Black, a local businessman and president of the New Orleans Jazz Club, convinced the local Chamber of Commerce that it was time to make another attempt at starting a jazz festival in New Orleans. The city would celebrate its 250th anniversary in 1968, and Black recognized it as an opportunity to promote the festival. Wein was asked again to develop the festival; however, when it was discovered that his wife Joyce was African-American, the offer was retracted, and events director Tommy Walker was hired instead. A jazz festival was planned, and evening concerts were held in 1968 under the billing The International Jazzfest with headliners that included Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and a variety of other artists.
In 1969, a second International Jazzfest took place, resulting in a negative return on investment, despite its big name lineup. Durel Black contacted Wein yet again, assured him that his interracial marriage was no longer an issue, and asked him to take charge of the festival. Wein agreed and was prepared and motivated to protect the culture and heritage in Louisiana. However, he also recognized the barriers that prevented the International JazzFest of '69 from flourishing. He concluded that the format of the festival had to be changed from the ground up, and that local collaboration was necessary for it to succeed.  He contacted Allan Jaffe, director of Preservation Hall, who arranged the necessary connections with Allison Miner, Quint Davis and several other promoters.

Foundation history and founding
The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival was established in 1970 under the guidance and vision of George Wein. The Festival achieved instant artistic success, despite its initial attendance of only 350 people. Wein's vision was straightforward: he wanted a large daytime fair with multiple stages featuring a diverse range of locally produced music styles, Louisiana cuisine food booths, and arts and crafts booths, as well as an evening concert series that would appeal to everyone. Wein also sought to develop a new perspective that would add a level of excitement to the festival presentation, and appeal to both The Crescent City culture and those who simply wanted to learn more about the city's unique way of life. In addition to local customs, he emphasized African, Caribbean, and French culture, and was able to present the music, cuisine and crafts of various cultures to the world through Jazz Fest in a way that was enjoyable and exciting.

""This festival could only take place in New Orleans, because here and only here is America's richest musical heritage."" ~George Wein
The first Jazz Fest took place in 1970 outside the French Quarter in a park ""that was once the site of Congo Square – the space where, during the 18th century, enslaved people gathered to trade, dance, and play music from their countries of origin."" In 1972, after relocating to the infield of the Fair Grounds Race Course, Jazz Fest expanded by utilizing the entire 145-acre (59 ha) site. By 1975, the inaugural year of the Festival's limited-edition, silkscreen poster series, attendance was expected to reach 80,000. From 1976 to 1978, Jazz Fest expanded to two full weekends in conjunction with the Heritage Fair, and in 1979, the Festival expanded to three weekends to celebrate its tenth anniversary.

By the early 1980s, the Festival continued growing in popularity, earning widespread recognition as one of the world's cultural celebrations. From the 1970s to the 1980s, Jazz Fest contributed to an unprecedented boom in tourism that earned Crescent City the moniker ""Creole Disneyland"". In 2017, total attendance for Jazz Fest was about 425,000 over seven days, exceeding the total population of Orleans Parish per prior census estimates. Pre-COVID-19, the attendance had grown to nearly 500,000.
Over the years, the Festival has had its share of financial difficulties, as well as an identity crisis on stage and in the tents. Local African-American activists accused the Festival of exploiting its performers and under-representing the communities that made Jazz Fest possible. Internal conflicts also arose which left the 1982 Festival temporarily without board member Quint Davis, who handled the Festival's production. In 1983, Davis returned and has produced it ever since.
The year 2020 marks the first year in the Festival's fifty-year history to be cancelled because of concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. The event was rescheduled to take place in the Fall 2021, October 8–17, which is within the Atlantic hurricane season.

Yearly posters
For every Jazz Fest from 1984 to 2020 & since 2022, there have been a series of posters released that are related to that year's event. These posters have become some of the most widely recognized pieces of art in the New Orleans/Louisiana area. They are sold at the festival and after the festival online and in many art stores around the area. Posters gain significant value as time goes on.

Festival features
The Festival features a variety of local food and craft vendors. The official food policy of the Festival is ""no carnival food"".  There are more than seventy food booths that include local dishes like crawfish beignets, cochon de lait sandwiches, alligator sausage po' boy (sandwich), boiled crawfish, softshell crab po'boy, Cajun jambalaya, jalapeño bread, fried green tomatoes, Oyster patties, muffulettas, red beans and rice, and crawfish Monica. Vegan and vegetarian options are also available. All food vendors are small, locally owned businesses. Jazz Fest ranks second to Mardi Gras in terms of local economic impact.
Craft vendors are set up throughout the grounds, as are craft-making demonstrations. There are three main areas including the Congo Square African Marketplace, which features crafts from local, national, and international artisans; the Contemporary Crafts area, which features handmade clothing, leather goods, jewelry, paintings, sculptures, and musical instruments; and the Louisiana Marketplace, which displays baskets, hand-colored photographs, jewelry and landscape-themed art.
The Festival allocates large areas dedicated to cultural and historical practices unique to Louisiana. There are depictions of the many cultures that exist in the state, such as the Cajun culture, and the Los Isleños, who are descendants of native Canary Islanders. Some of the areas include the Louisiana Folklife Village, which focuses on state art and culture, the Native American Village and the Grandstand. The National Endowment of the Arts has recognized many the work of many of the folk demonstrators.
Parades are also held throughout the event. They include parades by the Mardi Gras Indians, marching bands, brass bands, and social aid and pleasure clubs.

Stages and tents
Jazz Fest grew to become one of the best festivals to watch local artists and musicians, such as the Rebirth Brass Band, Juvenile, and Fats Domino, in addition to well-known musicians like Ray Charles, Tina Turner and James Brown in the Tremé backyard. After 1972, the festival moved to the Gentilly community. By 2010, Jazz Fest had become more commercialized with headliners such as the Foo Fighters and Christina Aguilera, shifting away from its jazz-dominated roots.
The festival has various performance stages including:

The Congo Square stage name pays homage to a gathering place where enslaved black people would meet to sell goods to buy their freedom, play instruments, and dance. Under the Code Noir, Catholic slavemasters allowed their slaves to have Sundays off. That day off helped to preserve the tradition and spirit of African dancing and drumming. The name of the gathering area was changed to Louis Armstrong Park, where drummers traditionally perform on Sundays in honor of their enslaved ancestors.
In 2015, Jazz Fest honored the 40th birthday of New Orleans Center for Creative Arts (NOCCA). Displays included student artwork; live performances of spoken word and musical theater were featured at the Cultural Pavilion. NOCCA Alumni showcased their musical talents at the Zatarains/WWOZ Jazz Tent, where they paid homage to the legacy of Ellis Marsalis Jr. The festival has an ongoing partnership with local schools like NOCCA to give young artists an opportunity to showcase their talents to a larger audience.

Performers
The festival has featured a variety of musicians and performers every year since its founding, ranging from Louisiana musicians to international pop stars. Many popular New Orleans musicians have played annually for long stretches over the history of the festival such as the Neville Brothers, Dr. John, Ellis Marsalis, and The Radiators.
Applications to perform (from the general public) are limited to bands from Louisiana to promote and preserve local culture.

The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Foundation
The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization that presents the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. The foundation was formed in 1970 as the festival's nonprofit arm. Festival founders George Wein, Quint Davis and Allison Miner trusted that Jazz Fest would be a success, despite a slow start in ticket sales. Their foresight led to the decision to establish the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Foundation as a nonprofit, allowing the opportunity to give the proceeds back to the local community by way of cultural programming when revenue increased.
Over the years, festival revenue increased, but the Foundation struggled to cover costs associated with its programs. In 2004, Don Marshall was brought on board as the Foundation's executive director. Other sources of funding come from galas and special events, corporate donors, individual donations and public and private grants.
The Foundation operates with a full-time staff and a four-part board of directors that includes a voting board, advisory council, Past Presidents Senate and an Honor Council. Its mission statement says: ""The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and Foundation, Inc. promotes, preserves, perpetuates and encourages the music, culture and heritage of communities in Louisiana through festivals, programs and other cultural, educational, civic and economic activities.""
The Foundation maintains active involvement with the local community through its assets, programming and educational enrichment. The local programs range from teaching Jazz to local teens, to preserving recordings, artifacts and interviews. The programs aid in economic growth by providing jobs for local artists and entertainers while offering entertainment to citizens.

Foundation assets
The following resources were created by the Foundation as sources of funding to provide year-round programming that focuses on cultural education, economic development and cultural enrichment.

The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival
WWOZ 90.7 FM – a local radio station based in the French Quarter with programs by volunteers whose mission is ""to be the worldwide voice, archive, and flag-bearer of New Orleans culture and musical heritage"". In 2020, the station celebrated its 40th anniversary and gained national news coverage after its efforts to provide a sense of ""normalcy"" in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. WWOZ 90.7 FM broadcasts live during Jazz Fest and provides local, cultural content year round.
Jazz & Heritage Foundation Archive – an educational resource that acts as a repository for items of historical and cultural importance in Louisiana. The Archive consists mainly of recordings from the Festival, but also features magazines, posters, film and photographs. The artifacts are available for scholarly research, and fellowships are granted to encourage use of the archive.
The George & Joyce Wein Jazz & Heritage Center – a performance and education venue that also serves as the location for the Don ""Moose"" Jamison Heritage School of Music and the Foundations year-round programming. The center is named after Jazz Fest founder George Wein and his wife, Joyce.
The Jazz & Heritage Gala – a celebration that raises funds for free music education in New Orleans. The proceeds are donated to the Don ""Moose"" Jamison Heritage School of Music which provides music education to over 280 students in the city.

Educational programming
Don ""Moose"" Jamison Heritage School of Music – The School of Music is the Foundation's unique cultural education program which began in 1990 as an after-school program. Initially, the school was tuition-free and taught only a few students on the campus of Southern University at New Orleans. In 2014, the George and Joyce Wein Jazz & Heritage Center opened in Tremé. The center is the permanent location of the School and instructs over 200 students each week. Classes now range from after-school to weekends and utilize instrumental techniques, ear training and composition to teach the art of music and performance.
Tom Dent Congo Square Lecture Series – Tom Dent (1932–1998), born to Ernestine and Albert W. Dent. Dent was an African-American cultural activist and poet from New Orleans. He was influenced by cultural writers of African-American struggles. Dent served as the executive director of the Foundation from 1987 to 1990. While serving on the board, he founded the Congo Square Lecture Series. After his death, the name was changed to The Tom Dent Congo Square Lecture series in his honor. The series was created to engage local creatives in scholarly conversations surrounding culture and African-American history. Topics range from Jazz and Creole history, Carnival around the world and the evolution of jazz funerals in New Orleans.
Class Got Brass Contest – a 'Battle of the Brass Bands' for all middle and high schools in Louisiana that was created to encourage school band programs to participate in the musical culture of New Orleans. The winner receives music education funds for their school. Prizes range from $1,000 to $10,000 and non-winners receive a $1,000 stipend for participating. Each band is limited to 12 members, and each member must be currently enrolled in the competing school. Judges consider originality, adherence to tradition, improvisation, tightness and overall presentation when deciding winners.
Songwriting Workshops for Kids with PJ Morton – a series of songwriting workshops that are open to middle and high school students in New Orleans. The workshops and applications are free but are limited to 30 students. Students learn songwriting techniques from PJ Morton.
Mardi Gras Indian Beading and African Drumming Workshops – a series of free workshops that take place at the George and Joyce Wein Jazz & Heritage Center. Beading workshops are led by Howard Miller, the chief of the Creole Wild West Mardi Gras Indian tribe. Miller teaches the workshops to students ages 10–17 in New Orleans. Drumming workshops are led by Luther Gray, head of the Congo Square Preservation Society. Gray provides drums to students who cannot provide their own.

Economic development programming
Jazz & Heritage Music Relief Fund – a statewide relief fund to support musicians who have lost income due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic caused venue closures all around the world and left many New Orleans' musicians without a source of income. The Fund has provided emergency grants to over 2500 musicians in the city and the campaign for fundraising is ongoing. Donations continue to be received from organizations like Spotify, Michael Murphy Productions, the Goldring Foundation and the Bentson Foundation.
Community Partnership Grants – proceeds from the Festival are invested back into the community. Over $8 million has been redistributed through community partnership grants to fund cultural projects, all of which must align with the Foundation's mission. Recent category additions include the Louisiana Cultural Equity Arts Grant which allows BIPOC creatives to focus on creating new works. Applications are accepted from all over Louisiana, and represent a wide range of diversity.
Jazz & Heritage Film Festival – the Foundation works with the New Orleans Video Access Center to put on a festival that showcases documentaries about south Louisiana or that are produced by New Orleans filmmakers. The festival lasts three days and includes screenings and networking for film industry professionals.  A majority of the featured films have been awarded funding from the Foundation's Community Partnership Grants. The festival takes place in February at the George and Joyce Wein Jazz & Heritage Center.
The Catapult Fund – the Foundation supports the local restaurant industry by providing small business owners with funding and business training by way of the Catapult Fund. Funding partners of the Catapult Fund have included Capital One Bank, the Louisiana Small Business Development Center (LSBDC,) the Louisiana Cultural Economy Foundation (LCEF,) and the Ashé Cultural Arts Center. The Fund is open to small business owners in the food and beverage and culinary arts industry. These businesses can include LLC's, sole proprietorships, and incorporated businesses. Over a period of five months, accepted applicants attend 17 free instructional classes focused on business development. Those who participate in the course receive a food safety training certification and leave with new knowledge of key strategies for running a successful business by addressing solutions to the unique challenges the restaurant sector faces in New Orleans. Additionally, a grant pool of $50,000 is portioned and rewarded to participants who successfully complete the course.

Cultural enrichment programming
Jazz & Heritage Concerts – the Jazz & Heritage Concert Series consists of concerts presented by the Foundation throughout the year, in the off-season of Jazz Fest. The concerts are admission free and held at the George and Joyce Wein Jazz & Heritage Center. The Foundation also presents two free concerts during Jazz Fest each year. The concerts not only highlight local favorites but artists from different parts of the country. The concert series has followed themes that highlight underrepresented populations. The most recent series, titled ""Chanteuse: Celebrating New Orleans Women in Music"", was scheduled for the weekend of March 13, 2020, but was postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The series focuses on women and/or femme-identifying persons to bring attention to the lack of female representation in the music industry. Reports show that women accounted for 21.7% of all artists in 2019, and the ratio of male to female producers was 37 to 1. Cyrille Aimée, Germaine Bazzle and Maggie Koerner were among the artists initially scheduled to perform. A visual arts exhibit called Femme Fest, sponsored by the Women's Caucus for Art of Louisiana (WCALA,) was set to be featured at the Jazz & Heritage Art Gallery as a part of the series as well.
Crescent City Blues & BBQ Festival – the Crescent City Blues & BBQ Festival is a free celebration of music, food and art presented by the Foundation. The festivities typically take place in Lafayette Square and showcase artists like Little Freddie King.
Treme' Creole Gumbo Festival and Congo Square Rhythms Festival – the Treme’ Creole Gumbo Festival and the Congo Square Rhythms Festival are admission free festivals presented by the Foundation, and are typically held in Armstrong Park. In 2019 the Congo Square Rhythms Festival took place simultaneously; therefore, the two could work together to increase their impact on the city. African Drumming, Jazz, Funk and Gospel are among the performances that represent the African diaspora's cultural impact on New Orleans.
Louisiana Cajun-Zydeco Festival – an admission free festival presented by the Foundation that focuses on Cajun and Zydeco music and takes place in the Spring at Armstrong Park. Much like other Foundation festivals, local art, food and entertainment are showcased at this annual two-day event. Vendors sell seafood, especially crawfish, while art markets and youth activities are available.
Johnny Jackson Jr. Gospel Is Alive Celebration – an outreach program for senior citizens in New Orleans. The concert is admission free and held at the Franklin Avenue Baptist Church. Foundation board member, Johnny Jackson Jr. supported this specific concert from its onset in 1990. It was eventually named after him in honor of his support. Past performers have included the Gospel Soul Children and Rance Allen. Each year Gospel Is Alive! recognizes those who have contributed to the gospel community in a significant way.

History and cultural analysis
Nisei Week's history began during the financially difficult era of the Great Depression — Issei, first generation Japanese immigrants, were growing too old and the Gentlemen's Agreement prohibited new Japanese immigration. The English speaking Nisei became a sought after potential revenue source to support Little Tokyo businesses dominated by Issei. With Little Tokyo falling into stagnation, Nisei week was a celebration intended to attract Niseis and to help generate more youthful exuberance in the district.
Mihiko Shimizu, original inventor of the festival, and other Issei business owners vied for an alliance with the Nisei run Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) to promote the festival. However, the possibility of being labelled as anti-American by anti-Japanese groups remained a concern, due to the collaboration of the two generations (American citizens and Japanese nationals) and cultural overtones of the festival. The Issei business owners decided to hand over all aspects of the celebration to the independent JACL to settle the problem. The first festival was held August 13, 1934, founded by the JACL.
Beyond economic reasons, Nisei Week was created to promote ""ethnic solidarity"". Utilizing Nisei Week's cultural environment, by centering it in the heart of Little Tokyo and holding cultural events, Issei hoped to bring Nisei back into the cultural fold of the older generation. Issei also hoped for Nisei to become brokers between Little Tokyo and the dominant society around it. The creation of the Nisei Week Queen, one year after the first Nisei Week in 1935, may be seen as the epitome of cultural mediation and broker between the Japanese community and white America. Mike Haigwara, Nisei Week's 2007 Street Arts and Carnival director, attributes Nisei Week with helping foster Japanese American identity and self-esteem.
Japanese internment presented another tumultuous and racially charged period for Nisei Week and the greater Japanese community. Executive Order 9066 was initiated in 1942, relocating and confining Japanese Americans to internment camps, including those running Nisei Week. The festival has been running continuously, except the years during and immediately after internment. Nisei Week celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1990, shifted from 6 years of inactivity during the WWII era. Despite obstacles, Nisei Week is the longest running Japanese festival in California, celebrating its 80th birthday in 2020.
Retrospectively, the celebration was seen by Time Magazine as dual reminder: ""Unofficially, it recalls an ugly footnote to American history: the World War II evacuation and internment of more than 110,000 West Coast Japanese, most of them native-born U.S. citizens."" Lon Kurashige, professor of ethnic studies at USC, proposes that the lingering effects of internment changed Nisei Week's cultural tones and affiliations, in part due to the weakening role of men during the internment period, which again shifted during and after the civil rights period.
Phillip Morris' first promotional event targeted at Asian and Pacific Islander American community events was staged at Nisei Week. The event was part of a larger ""PULL strategy"" program, which included marketing to increase brand recognition among Asians. A Marlboro booth provided samples and attempted to attract consumers by displaying a McLaren MP4/4 show car (Marlboro sponsored McLaren's F1 team at the time) at the 1988 Nisei Week festival.
In 1982, businesswoman Frances Hashimoto became the first woman to chair the Nisei Week festival.
""Aki the Akita"", Nisei Week's official mascot, was created by renowned mascot artist Dick Sakahara in 1997 for Nisei Week's now defunct Dog Show . Aki appears as a costumed character to greet and entertain children, or in cartoon form as a symbol for the festival.
Nisei Week wasn't held between 1942 & 1945 nor 2020; the latter year saw a virtual festival.

Festivities
Nisei Week has many attractions and exhibitions, which change annually, though many traditions remain each year.

Nisei Week Grand Parade
The Nisei Week Parade takes place on the primary Sunday of Nisei Week. The parade features many varied participants, mostly from Southern California and Japan, including the following: local high school marching bands, ondo dancing groups, martial art dojos, elected parade marshals (usually celebrities or community heroes), Japanese and local politicians (such as the Mayor of Los Angeles), a mikoshi shrine, floats, pageant queens, taiko players, etc. Spanning several hours, the Nisei Week Parade lasts long due to its many participants and slow walk pace of traditional Japanese dancers.
Aomori Nebuta, a famous festival within Japan, presented an imported parade float at the 2007 Grand Parade. The parade took place on August 19, at 6pm, in order for the float's lights to be visible after nightfall.
The 2011 parade on August 14 featured former Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda as grand marshal. American figure skater Mirai Nagasu, American actress and singer Gina Hiraizumi, Japanese singer and TV personality Kenichi Mikawa have appeared in the parade.

Go For Broke and U.S. 100th Infantry Battalion Exhibits
After World War II, exhibits were introduced about internment camps and JA veterans, including those of the U.S. 100th Infantry Battalion. Currently, the Japanese American National Museum (JANM) and Go For Broke Monument have replaced separate exhibits and the old JANM building. JA veterans still march annually in the Nisei Week Parade.

Nisei Week Car Show
The Car Show was introduced in 2000 and is produced by Mainstream Productions LLC. / Showoff Car Show. The show features import cars, exhibits, import models, along with car competitions for cash and sponsor prizes. The Car Show is one of the few admission based events at Nisei Week, covering the cash prize and logistics of a full fledge festival, including live entertainment and exhibits. The import scene is argued as both influenced and originated within the Asian American community and linked to Asian American identity.

Nisei Week Queen and Court
The 2nd annual Nisei Week introduced the Nisei Week pageant and Nisei Week Coronation Ball in 1935. The pageant was created to help reinvigorate local business and promote goodwill in the greater Los Angeles community. In early years of the pageant, patrons of Little Tokyo businesses would receive a ballot to vote for the Queen. Today, the queen is crowned for her community service and presentation skills, with a formal coronation held for judging and celebration. New Queens and Princesses are inducted annually and featured prominently on float during the Nisei Week Parade. The Queen and Court are crowned at a formal dinner of 700 guests on the primary weekend of Nisei Week's festival. During the one-year reign, the Nisei Week court members have the opportunity to gain wide exposure to global dignitaries and local industry leaders and the chance to travel to cities including Nagoya, Japan; San Francisco; and Honolulu, Hawaii to experience the various sister festivals and make life-long connections.

Pageant controversy
The pageant has not been without controversy. Originally the queen was selected through ballots given after purchases in Little Tokyo, allowing those making many purchases to vote many times; the rule was changed to allow a fairer chance for all contestants. One controversy remains within the JA community: mixed-race contestants. Competitors must be of at least 50% Japanese ancestry. Due to the increased out-marriage ratio of Japanese Americans, multi-racial (also known as hapa in the Japanese community) contestants began to appear more frequently, causing questioning about the Japanese cultural spirit of the competition and competing beauty standards of whites versus Asians.
Lon Kurashige, professor of ethnic studies at USC, argues that Nisei Queens played a subordinate role to as ambassadors to Issei, Nisei and white Americans. The Queens were viewed as bi-cultural, possessing ""quiet charm"" and ""lively personality"", attributed to Japanese and white Americans respectively. Criticism of sexism was brought forth by the Women's Concerns Committee within the JACL. The typical beauty portion of pageants, such as swimsuit competition, were eliminated from the Queen coronation.

Nisei Week Street Arts Fair and Carnival
Originally similar to a matsuri (Japanese style festival) or carnival, a street festival was held over the weekend, featuring games, crafts, and rides for children, along with food and arts vendors. Street Arts was created in addition to the carnival to feature Southern California crafts and food vendors. The old style carnival was largely removed by 2000's festival year. Street Arts and the carnival were always open to the public, with no admission fee.
The 2006 fair included an eating contest of dumplings (gyoza). World champion eaters Sonya Thomas and Joey Chestnut competed in the International Federation of Competitive Eating sanctioned event, with both competitors eating over 200 dumplings.

Old School Carnival Return
Mike Hagiwara, a Nisei Week committee member, announced the return of the ""old school"" Nisei Week carnival for 2007's festivities, under his direction. His press release, circulating by email and JA news, describes the nostalgia and eventual dwindling of the carnival. The carnival goals include creating long lasting and enjoyable memories to a new generation, along with helping the older generation relive memories of Nisei Week's past. The carnival also plans to avoid commercialization, using community groups to populate the vending and game booths. Hagiwara believes the carnival will help foster Japanese American identity, giving JAs a medium to feel better about themselves and their heritage.

JSN Matsuri
Partnering with the Japanese Student Network (JSN), Nisei Week's 66th annual celebration included a Japanese style carnival thrown by JSN.

Tofu Festival
In coordination with the Little Tokyo Service Center, Tofu Fest was added as a subcommittee to Nisei Week in 1996, focusing on Japanese cuisine and obon like atmosphere. As its name suggests, tofu was the primary ingredient of dishes and the cultural icon of the festival.  The Tofu Festival was discontinued after 2007.

Nikkei Games
The Nikkei Games offers competition and activities for Japanese American sports leagues, and open events such as running for children. It also features martial art competitions and exhibitions. Nisei Week supports the JA community through Nikkei Games, as Japanese American sports leagues remain an important part of JA culture and history (see also: Nikkei sports).

Little Tokyo Anime Festival
The Little Tokyo Anime Festival features video gaming, manga, martial arts, anime, cosplaying, and other Japanese popular culture exports, as part of booths and exhibits. A cosplay contest is held, where arbitrated best costume winners are presented. Cosplayers also take part in the Nisei Week parade. The 2007 cosplay contest was held on August 19, inside the Little Tokyo Shopping Center.
Hundreds of cosplayers participated in the annual Nisei Week parade. They stopped at Second Street and San Pedro Street for a large group picture.

Nisei Week Fashion Show
The Nisei Week Fashion Show showcases fashion and provides entertainment acts. The Nisei Week court usually does an opening number to commence the event (e.g., a choreographed dance).  Other Japanese-American models, often past Nisei Week court members, walk the runway to represent the clothing lines.

Nisei Week Baby Pageant
Stemming from the queen pageant, the Baby Pageant allows for parents to showcase new born members of the community and provide an event for parent networking.

Tanabata Festival
The annual Los Angeles Tanabata Festival was started in 2009 during Nisei Week by the Little Tokyo Public Safety Association. Various community groups participate with colorful handmade paper ornament streamers called kazari, which literally means decoration in Japanese. Many performers (for example, Japanese performance artist Miyuki Matsunaga with her Geta Dance Art) appear on the main stage. The 12th annual festival will take place in mid-August 2022 at the JANM Plaza in Little Tokyo as the festival went on hiatus in 2020-21.

Gyoza Eating Championship
The Day-Lee Foods World Gyoza Eating Championship, which has been an annual event since 2008 after being held in 2006, has become a major event on the Major League Eating calendar.  The event attracts top stars on the competitive eating circuit, with Joey Chestnut and Matt Stonie winning the past few years.  Other notable stars who have competed include Miki Sudo, Eric ""Badlands"" Booker, and Geoffrey Esper.

Ondo dancing and closing
In tradition of Japanese matsuris, traditional ondo dances are conducted in a closing celebration of Nisei Week's events. Madame Fujima Kansuma was 2006's official choreographer, where her and fellow instructors held chochin lanterns marked with the names of deceased instructors of the past. Public participation is encouraged, with formal dance troupes, Nisei Week Queen and Court, families, and community groups joining in for the dances.
Official passing of Nisei Week Foundation office positions to a new cabinet also takes place during closing speeches.

Events, performances, and participation
Each year, the festival spotlights a particular ethnic community or folk tradition through the Cultural Focus program. In recent years, these cultural focuses have included maritime culture, Arab-American life, the Urban Indian, Bulgarian Culture and the passing of cultural traditions from generation to generation. The most recent Cultural Focus programs include the Traditional Roots of Hip Hop, Echoes of Aztlan and Beyond and Youth Rising. The festival has over 20 stages, large and small, set up throughout the Seattle Center grounds, which feature mostly local acts organized by the festival. Like the volunteers who support the festival, they perform without compensation. Many of the venues, notably the Armory and the nearby Fisher Pavilion, are set up for participatory dancing.
The festival grounds also include extensive space for music jams and drum circles. Many attendees from across Washington state, Oregon and British Columbia, come to Northwest Folklife annually to play music with friends.

The festival also has buskers (or street performers) who come to the festival from all over and perform along the Seattle Center walkways. The buskers include musicians, jugglers, circus performers, and magicians, and vary in age, style, and professionalism, all playing for donations from the crowds. Festival organizers recently began asking that buskers donate 15% of their earnings (from any tips or CD sales) to the festival, which is the same asked of vendors.
The performances featured both on and off stage expand on what the term ""folk"" means. Traditional folk music from all over the world is performed, along with rockabilly, Balkan brass, folk punk, jug band, and other music that defies categorization. Dance performances include international folk dancing (including Morris dancing) as well as swing and blues.
The festival is also a place where people can simply hang out and enjoy the (usually sunny) Memorial Day Weather. The giant fountain in the center of Seattle Center serves as a water park. Since the festival is open to all, people often come to picnic, sunbathe, or just enjoy the grounds.

The festival is hosted at the Alabama Rural Heritage Center, which is located in the old home economics building on the former Marengo County High School campus that was redesigned and repurposed by Auburn University's Rural Studio.  The Pepper Jelly Festival is a celebration of rural life and traditions in western Alabama.  Formerly named Rural Fun Day, the event was renamed in recognition of the unique pepper jelly made at the Rural Heritage Center.  The festival features music, homemade food, art, crafts, entertainment, and other activities that reflect the culture of a rural Southern way of life.  The festival is historically the second-largest held every year in Marengo County, behind Christmas on the River in Demopolis.

""Being under the auspices of the Duquesne University, the Festival is a non-profit venture dedicated to a closer relationship of the present day citizenry and a better appreciation of their contribution to Pittsburgh growth, especially on the occasion of the bi-centennial year.""

History
Initially sponsored by Duquesne University, this festival has been held annually since 1956. Various cultures have been represented, since that time through music, folk dance, and performances on the main stage while different vendors sell traditional food as well as arts and crafts during the festival.

1950s
In 1956, the first festival was held at the Syria Mosque, beginning at 5 p.m. each day on Saturday and Sunday, June 9 and 10. Food booths were located on the mosque's ground floor with multicultural exhibits of history, crafts and products displayed in the mosque's upstairs lobby. On Saturday, the two-hour program, which began at 8 p.m., featured dances, folk singers and storytellers from Scottish, Hungarian, Bulgarian, American, Croatian, Russian, Slovak, Greek, ad German traditions while the Sunday program featured Italian, Lithuanian, Lebanese, Carpatho-Russian, Polish, Irish, Israeli, Chinese, and Ukrainian cultural performances.
The theme of the third annual festival, which was also held at the Syria Mosque, was ""Unity in Diversity: Democracy and Beauty; Fun and Friendliness!"" It was held from Friday, May 9 through Sunday, May 11, 1958.
Held again at the Syria Mosque in 1959, the fourth annual event began at 5 p.m. each night from Friday May 15 through Sunday, May 17. Friday evening's performances represented Swiss, Indian, Italian, Lithuanian, Scottish, and Hungarian traditions while Slovak, German, Croatian, Chinese, Ukrainian, and Greek groups performed on Saturday, and Bulgarian, Irish, Mexican, Lebanese, Carpatho-Russian, and Polish groups closed out the festival on Sunday. General admission tickets were $1.50 per person. More than 3,000 people attended that year's opening day events.

1960s
In 1962, Robert Morris Junior College took over sponsorship of the festival.
The tenth annual festival included ""a French show and French booths"" for the first time. The event was held again at the Syria Mosque in May of 1966.
By 1967, the festival had grown so large that it was moved to Pittsburg's Civic Arena.

1970
In 1976, which was both the twentieth anniversary of the Pittsburgh Folk Festival and the year in which the United States Bicentennial was celebrated, newspapers across the country reported that Pittsburgh's annual multicultural event had become one of its nation's largest outdoor festivals. Festival operators received $22,000 in state funds via the Allegheny County Bicentennial Commission that year to add two days to the event's schedule and provide free admission to students and senior citizens.
More than thirty thousand people were expected to attend the festival in 1977.

1980s
In 1985, festival planners introduced several new features, including an International Bazaar, where attendees could purchase ""authentic ethnic artifacts,"" and a new family ticket plan that allowed parents to purchase admission for two adults and two children for nine dollars, for a savings of six dollars off the standard general price of admission. That year, attendance figures declined sixteen percent, from the 38,000 visitors it had attracted in 1984 to 32,000. Planners faulted a decision by Pittsburgh city officials to allow the scheduling of a free carnival event for children on the same day of the 1985 festival at Three Rivers Stadium.
For the festival's thirtieth anniversary in 1986, longtime festival organizers Charles and Carol Cubelic programmed the event to highlight the histories and cultures of India, Korea and Poland, with India's extensive programming timed to coincide with the Festival of India Exhibition that was touring the United States at the time, after having opened at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.
Carol Cubelic took over as director of the festival in October 1989 when her husband's health declined sharply. He died from cancer shortly afterward on October 29, 1989. The 1989 Pittsburgh Folk Festival, the final event overseen by Charles Cubelic, was one of the most successful in the festival's history, attracting more than forty thousand attendees during its three-day run.

1990s
The thirty-fourth annual Pittsburgh Folk Festival, the first under the leadership of Carole Cubelic, was held from May 25 to 27, 1989. ""I came to Pittsburgh in 1992. And when I married my late husband, I married this festival,"" she said when interviewed by The Pittsburgh Press the day before the festival's Memorial Day weekend opening. The theme of that year's festival was ""A Taste of the Old World."" Live cooking demonstrations were sponsored by Equitable Gas.
In 1992, Robert Morris College ended its sponsorship of the festival, citing that it had lost twenty to thirty thousand dollars over the thirty-year period that it had sponsored the event. As a result, Carole Cubelic, who had been employed by the college as a student accounts administrator while also serving as assistant director and then director of the Pittsburgh Folk Festival, stepped down from her role as festival director. The college subsequently transferred the Pittsburgh Folk Festival Corporation to the nineteen groups that had collectively provided the cultural performances, food and volunteer staffing for the festival for nearly forty years. Additionally, negotiations with the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, which had been the festival's venue for many years, turned difficult when center managers began pushing festival planners to ""expand the event into an ethnic food fair,"" which event planners feared would ruin the festival's food reputation with increased participation of inauthentic, carnival-style pizza and Italian sausage stands. Convention center executives also planned to double or triple charges for booth rentals and utility use while proposing that the $6 general admission fee be cut in half, which would have eliminated a source of revenue for the multicultural groups hoping to participate in the event. In response, the festival's new organizers moved the 36th annual event from the convention center to the Melody Tent and Amphitheater at Station Square, which was operated by the Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation. Held again on Memorial Day weekend, event planners hoped to attract a crowd of forty to fifty thousand attendees.
Festival leadership changed again the following year with Nan Krushinski taking the helm as festival administrator on behalf of Pittsburgh Folk Festival Inc., the business organization formed by the multiple cultural organizations that had been involved in presenting the festival over the years. Still scheduled on Memorial Day weekend, the 37th annual event was held, for the first time in its history, at a venue outside of Pittsburgh city limits. Opening at the Pittsburgh Expo Mart in Monroeville on Friday, May 28, 1993, the festival launched a new entertainment plan with three stages changing various presenters every thirty minutes as the stages operated continuously throughout each festival day. Ticket prices were set at five dollars for adults (four dollars for senior citizens), and three dollars for children aged three to twelve.
By the time of its fortieth anniversary in 1996, the Pittsburgh Folk Festival had returned to the David L. Lawrence Convention Center in the city's downtown. The festival's head that year was Angela Lipchick.

Fiftieth anniversary (2006)
Still held at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center in downtown Pittsburgh in 2006, the Pittsburgh Folk Festival celebrated its fiftieth anniversary by inviting the participation of twenty-five different ethnic groups, five of which (Bulgaria, Greece, Lebanon, Lithuania, and Ukraine) had been represented every year since the festival's founding in 1956. The Rev. James Root chaired that year's event. Walter Kolar, a member of the festival since its founding, developed a fiftieth-anniversary display.

Present day
In 2016, festival organizers celebrated the sixtieth anniversary of the Pittsburgh Folk Festival in conjunction with the city of Pittsburgh's bicentennial celebrations. It was held over Labor Day weekend, from September 3 to 4, in the Schenley Plaza Tent in Oakland. More than forty distinct cultures from twenty different countries were celebrated with Bhutan, Egypt, Mexico, and Venezuela represented for the first time in the event's history. Admission was free.
There was no festival in 2020. Resumption of the festival happened a year later.

Television broadcast
The festivities are often telecast, live or recorded, to stations not only in New Jersey, but also in Portugal and Portuguese-speaking countries in Africa and South America.

Portugal Day Races
The Portugal Day Races take place every year on the Sunday morning of Portugal Day weekend prior to the parade. Every year runners and walkers, Portuguese or not, gather and race in the historic Ironbound section, celebrating Portuguese-American culture.
The race was founded in 1979 by the late Manuel Parente and was directed for many years by the late Domingos Cravo. The races have always been organized by Lar Dos Leos (Den of Lions). In honor of Parente's and Cravo's contributions to the Portuguese community, the ""Cravo Kid Dash"" and the ""Parente Mile"" have been named in their honor. The 5k race has also been renamed as the ""Jack Casimiro 5k"" in honor of a longtime sponsor of the Portugal Day Races, the late Jack Casimiro. Today, the race is still organized by Lar Dos Leos (Den of Lions) and by longtime race director Carlos Martins.

Parade
On the Sunday of that weekend, there is a parade with many floats representing various organizations from throughout the state, both Portuguese and non-Portuguese.  Every year there is a Honorary Grand Marshal, a Grand Marshal, as well as many other prized personalities.

History
Tulip Time's roots can be traced to a 1927 community beautification project.  Lida Rogers, a biology teacher at Holland High School, suggested Holland adopt the tulip as its flower due to the city's close ties to The Netherlands.

In 1928, City council approved funding to import 100,000 tulip bulbs from the Netherlands and plant them in city parks. The next year, the city invited visitors to come during the week including May 15.  The success prompted an annual event to be born. During World War II, Tulip Time was scaled back, returning with a four-day festival in 1946.
The 1947 festival was geared towards celebrating Holland, Michigan's centennial.  A tradition was started that year when Michigan's governor, Kim Sigler, donned a Dutch costume and took part in the festivities. As America celebrated its bicentennial in 1976, Tulip Time was honored with the presence of President Gerald R. Ford, a Michigander who had formerly represented nearby Grand Rapids in the United States Congress.
The reconstruction of the authentic 200-year-old ""De Zwaan"" windmill on Windmill Island in 1965 added another tourist attraction.
In 1991, Tulip Time expanded from four to ten days. In 2001, the festival was shortened to eight days and moved up a week to better coincide with when the tulips were in bloom. A carnival was added in 2003.
In 2008, the outdoor concert series, renamed Tulipalooza, was moved to the Sixth Street Stage at 6th street and College Ave.
The 2020 festival was canceled for the first time due to the COVID-19 crisis. In 2021 the festival was resumed virtually, and in 2022 the festival returned to in-person activities.

Performances and appearances
The Tulip Time festival has hosted performances and appearances by many well known artists and public figures.

The current incarnation of the event draws 7,000, though this is only because of capacity issues; ticket sales were capped at 7,000 after the 1997 event also drew over 13,000 fans, well over the convention center's capacity. Tickets for the event regularly sell out within minutes of being put on sale, which usually occurs in early August.
The in-person event was not held in 2020 due to crowd size limits imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York (state). A radio broadcast on WTSS, which will break from the station's usual Christmas music format, coincided with an Internet stream on the World's Largest Disco Web site featuring replays of video from past events. The in-person event will return in 2021, with a capacity reduced to 6,500.
The event is a charity fundraiser held by Conesus Fest for Charity to raise funds for Camp Good Days and Special Times, a summer camp for children with cancer.
In 1979 “The World’s Largest Disco” was created by Glenn Arnette, Director of the Buffalo Convention Center, along with Bruce Marsh and Steve LaManna. With 17,000 attending,as stated in the Guinness Book of World’s Records it was officially declared “the largest disco event.”  The top disco stars were there, 10 top DJ’s from around the world and everyone dressed in disco and loved each minute.  It lasted until 6 AM from dusk til dawn.  No one left!
This is how it started!

Additionally there are featured evens like Illumination@YpsiFest where local business compete for prizes by creating illuminated sculptures for an evening display, and an illumination parade.

History
The festival was first held on Saturday, July 15, 1978, ""from noon 'til nightfall"". The sidewalks and streets in Depot Town had just been re-paved, and the Depot Town Association held a ""Sidewalk Celebration"". The poster advertised a noon sidewalk promenade led by the Honorable George Goodman ""Hizzoner"" the mayor of Ypsilanti and exciting ribbon cutting ceremonies, dedications and plain or fancy walkin'. The Sidewalk Celebration was such a success that a decision was made to repeat the event, to be known as the ""Ypsilanti Yesteryear Heritage Festival"".
According to other reports, a motivating factor was the desire to establish a historic district in Ypsilanti, to prevent the city from replacing historic buildings on North Huron Street and in Depot Town with new construction. A group of Ypsilantians applied to the state for funding to publish a guidebook to the city's historic homes, and were told that no money was available for that purpose, but that there was funding available to stage a festival. A $15,000 grant from the state helped to fund the 1979 Ypsilanti Yesteryear Heritage Festival.
In 1979, the festival drew 50,000 attendees, continued to grow quickly in subsequent years, and the name was soon shortened to the present name. By the mid-1980s the festival was attracting attention from non-local newspapers — a June 1985 edition of the Toledo Blade referred to it as an ""Old time circus, arts and crafts, and historic home tour"" — and later that decade the festival was drawing more than 250,000 attendees a year, though attendance subsequently declined, and in recent years the festival has drawn about 100,000 attendees.
2020 saw officials cancel the 43rd on COVID-19 pandemic concerns. That was deferred to 2021.

Activities
The Ypsilanti Heritage Festival includes and has included a wide variety of activities and events.
The Ypsilanti Historic Home Tour, held annually during the Ypsilanti Heritage Festival, began, like the festival proper, in 1979. A beer garden and gambling tent anchored the center of the festival from 1979 through 2010. In 2011 the gambling was eliminated for financial reasons, while the beer garden continued with an expanded food and drink selection; however, in January, 2012, new festival director Andrew Clock announced that ""the casino will be back, set up right next to the beer tent, where it belongs."" A bed race through downtown Ypsilanti was added as an annual event beginning in 2009.
The Ypsilanti Heritage Festival Parade began in 1979, and has been held every year. In 2007, the parade attracted wider attention when parade organizers approved the inclusion of a group protesting a proposed city income tax and subsequently revoked the permission. Festival coordinators explained that their rule was to exclude groups marching to represent controversial or political issues, and that the initial approval was an error.
Because the Ypsilanti Heritage Festival has often been the same weekend as the Woodward Dream Cruise, festival coordinators ""decided it would be a blast to have something that was the direct opposite of the Dream Cruise"", and the Nightmare Cruise, a spoof of the Woodward Dream Cruise, was born in 2005. The only rules are that ""[t]he car has to be legally driveable, and fluid leaks should be at a minimum.""
Other events have included a pole vault competition sanctioned by USA Track & Field, live theater, antique cars and fire engines, vintage base ball sponsored by Greenfield Village, ""Precious Pets"" and ""Beautiful Babies"" contests, a rubber duck race, a living history encampment, a high wire performance by one of The Flying Wallendas, and a circus.

""The Game That Never Was""
In 1973, Carolyn King, with support from the Ypsilanti City Council, became one of the first girls in the country to play Little League Baseball. When they found out that she was playing, Little League International officials pulled the Ypsilanti American Little League's charter, and the 1973 All-Star game between the rival Ypsilanti American and National Little Leagues was never played. Thirty-seven years later, the teams were re-assembled similar to an Old-Timers' Day event, in Frog Island Park, as part of the 2010 festival. Billed as ""The Game That Never Was"", the American League All-Stars (led by Carolyn, who led off and played center field) won, 15–14.

History
The ASF began in 1972 as a summer-stock theater project in Anniston. Its first performance was in the Anniston High School auditorium, before a single critic and his wife; the critic considered the performance very poor and predicted that the ASF would not survive. But the project persisted, with a number of innovative performances - including Taming of the Shrew set in 1950s New York City. Eventually, the Shakespeare Festival grew to garner critical acclaim, but lacked the financial support to keep it afloat. In December 1985, the ASF moved to Montgomery, as the result of Mr. and Mrs. Winton Blount's $21.5-million gift of a performing-arts complex set in a 250-acre (1-km²) landscaped park, the Winton M. Blount Cultural Park. The Carolyn Blount Theatre houses the 792-seat Festival Stage  and the 225-seat Octagon Theatre.
There was no 2020 season.

Education
Until 2009, ASF operated a Professional Actor Training program leading to the M.F.A. degree in cooperation with the University of Alabama Department of Theatre and Dance. Tony Award–winning actor Norbert Leo Butz and Emmy Award–winning actor Michael Emerson were two of the program's most successful alumni. On April 25, 2008, ASF announced that its relationship with the University of Alabama would be phased out following the graduation of the last class in August 2009.

The neighborhood is home to the Allentown Historic District.","The Allentown district is a neighborhood in Buffalo, New York. The neighborhood is home to the Allentown Historic District.

History
Allentown is named after Lewis F. Allen (1800–1890) who came to Buffalo in April 1827 to serve as Corporate Secretary and financial manager of an insurance company. Allen was also a farmer and when looking for space to let his cattle graze, purportedly his neighbor, Thomas Day, suggested some of his land, which sat between the cities of Buffalo and Black Rock. Allen's cattle path became known as Allen Street. Notably, Allen was one of the founders of the Buffalo Historical Society and Forest Lawn Cemetery, where he is buried. Allen was married to Margaret Cleveland Allen, who was the paternal aunt of future president Grover Cleveland. Allen introduced him to many influential people, including the partners in the law firm of Rogers, Bowen, and Rogers, where Cleveland later took a clerkship, which in turn led him to practice law and enter into politics.

Geography
Allentown is the first neighborhood north of the Downtown Buffalo core. It borders the downtown theater and entertainment district to its south, and runs north to North Street at its northern edge, Normal Avenue on the west, and Main street on the east. The neighborhood is generally centered on Allen Street and Elmwood Avenue.
Allentown is known for its community of artists, for its embrace of bohemian, hipster and gay culture, and for the civic commitment of residents to the historic and aesthetic sensibilities of the neighborhood. Allentown is one of Buffalo's premier areas for nightlife, dining, and antique shopping.

Historic district
The Allentown Historic District is a historic district that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, and expanded in 2012. It includes the Kleinhans Music Hall which is separately listed on the NRHP and is further designated as a National Historic Landmark. Also listed on the NRHP is the Birge-Horton House on Delaware Avenue.
The original 1980 boundaries include approximately 733 buildings, not including secondary structures. Of these, 6 are Gothic Revival, 125 Italianate, 24 Second Empire, 92 Shingle style, 106 Queen Anne, 15 Stick, 5 Shingle, 56 Colonial and 196 are plain framed buildings.
Three park areas are included in the area, two redesigned by Frederick Law Olmsted and one circle, Symphony Circle, designed by him as part of his master plan for the city's park areas. After he completed the master plan, Olmsted returned to redesign and landscape Day's Park (named after Allen's neighbor Thomas Day who donated his land to the City of Buffalo) and Arlington Park; two existing city parks. In Day's Park he added a circular walkway in front of the school so the students would not trample the grass. The circular sandstone planting area that was in the center of the walkway is still in existence. Arlington Park was home to Frank Lloyd Wright while he worked in Buffalo.
The new boundaries added about 320 properties to the list.

Allendale Theater - home of the Theater of Youth
Arlington Park - redesigned by Frederick Law Olmsted; home to Frank Lloyd Wright while he worked in Buffalo
Butler Mansion - currently UB's Jacobs Executive Development Center

Allentown Art Festival
The Allentown Art Festival, originally known as the Buffalo Art Festival, is an event started by Jason Natowitz in 1958, beginning as a small town meeting to stimulate business in the neighborhood. The meeting triggered the foundation of the Allentown Village Society, and, by August, plans were in the works for an outdoor art show in the town, which occurred the following month in September 1958. With only 50 artists, the event quickly became very successful. Louis Cherenzia, another one of the founders, noted ""It was rated as the most colorful cultural event in Buffalo since the Pan-American Exposition."" Following the event, the town recognized its success, and announced plans for a second annual.
""The Buffalo Art Festival"" quickly came to be identified with its more precise location, Allentown, and eventually its name became ""Allentown Art Festival"".
The Allentown Art Festival has grown since its beginnings 50 years ago. Support of the Allentown Village Society, Inc. and its number of volunteers has essentially stayed the same. According to the official website, ""Their labors have borne fruit beyond the annual Allentown Art Festival weekend and beyond the boundaries of the Allentown neighborhood of Buffalo.""

Its 30-acre site runs along the Wisconsin-Illinois state line west of Interstate 94. It recreates the visit of Queen Elizabeth I to the English port city of Bristol in 1574. The faire runs for nine weekends from early July through Labor Day.

History
The Bristol Renaissance Faire was founded in 1972 by Richard Shapiro and his wife Bonnie as ""King Richard's Faire"". The event was a four-weekend fair and drew approximately 10,000 people.
In 1988, the Shapiros sold the fair to Renaissance Entertainment Corporation, having created a second incarnation of the King Richard's Faire in Carver, Massachusetts. The original King Richard's Faire was re-opened that year as the ""Bristol Renaissance Faire"". The reigning monarch became Queen Elizabeth I rather than the fictional ""King Richard"", and the year was set at 1574.   At that time, the fair played seven weekends and drew over 200,000 visitors annually, thus placing it among the highest attended in the world.  Renaissance faire staples such as jousting tournaments, historical reenactments, and stage shows continue.
For the first time in its history, the faire's 2020 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Production values
The Bristol Faire's proximity to Chicago and Milwaukee enabled the artistic directors to bring improv comedy teachers from The Second City and The Players Workshop, including instructor and director Eric Forsberg, who taught improvised interactive street theater techniques until 1997, and Ron Scot Fry, who was artistic director from 1989 until 2008.
The Mud Show, Dirk & Guido: The Swordsmen, and Moonie the Magnificent have won awards from the Annual Renaissance Festival Awards.

Critical commentary
Journalist Neil Steinberg said of the Bristol Renaissance Faire: ""If theme parks, with their pasteboard main streets, reek of a bland, safe, homogenized, whitebread America, the Renaissance Faire is at the other end of the social spectrum, with a whiff of the occult, a flash of danger, and a hint of the erotic. Here, they let you throw axes. Here are more beer and bosoms than you'll find in all of Disney World.""

The festival is held annually on Saturdays and Sundays in October and November. An average of 230,000 visitors a year attend the festival during its Fall season.

History
The Carolina Renaissance Festival was founded in 1994 by Jeff Siegel, owner of Royal Faires, Ltd., the parent company.  Royal Faires also owns and operates the Arizona Renaissance Festival. The Carolina Renaissance Festival takes place on 25 acres (10 ha) of land located just north of Charlotte, North Carolina, between the towns of Huntersville and Concord.  It is one of the largest—by acreage—Renaissance fairs in America.

Acts and attractions
Carolina Renaissance Festival stage shows feature live music, dance, comedy shows, and performers with circus variety skills such as juggling, aerial skills, acrobatics, and sideshow antics. Musicians perform with traditional instruments such as the harp, bagpipes, and other obscure ""period"" instruments. Roaming the lanes of the festival are a variety of traveling  street performers who engage visitors in interactive performance experiences. An in-house performance company that features over 100 costumed characters that interact directly with visitors at the fair creates an authentic feel of the renaissance-era town. Professional and amateur actors and costume-play hobbyist help bring the ""village"" to life. Individuals in the company have developed unique characters such as the ""Village Baker,"" the ""Tavern Keeper,"" the village ""Lord Mayor,"" and a fictional Royal family that has come to visit Fairhaven. The participants in the company are primarily people from surrounding communities, including Concord, Greensboro, Raleigh, and Charlotte.

Major attractions
In addition to 16 stages of rotating, scheduled entertainers, there are three premier attractions: The jousting knights on horseback; the falconry demonstration; and the ""Sea Fairies"" mermaid exhibit.

Jousting
The jousts are enacted by performers from Aventail Productions; and the competition is judged with points that are awarded using a historically accurate scoring system. The victory is awarded to the true winners of each competition. The final joust of the day ends with a conflict settled by an unhorsing and ground fight to the ""death"".

Falconry
A variety of birds-of-prey are put on display highlighting their unique abilities and training that enraptured nobles long ago and made falconry the 'sport of kings.'

Mermaids
The Sea Fairies exhibit features mermaids swimming in a 3,000 gallon aquarium tank. Near the tank is a Mermaid sitting on a throne where children can have their photos taken.

Retail sales and services
Over 140 vendors sell a variety of handmade arts and craft goods such as artisan jewelry and leather goods, blown glass (made during live demonstrations), candles, and custom chain mail. The festival vends an assortment of medieval themed foods, including: giant turkey legs, savory soups, stews, and chowders (served in ""bread bowls""), ""Steak on a Stake"", fish and chips, corn on the cob, and Scotch eggs. The site also features games such as archery target-shooting, crossbow shooting, axe throwing, frog catapults, and a gold coin hunt.

Special events
Weddings and vow-renewal ceremonies are attended by the cast of the Royal Court and take place in a covered pavilion reserved for the event.
The festival has themed weekends throughout the course of the season.  Themes include: ""Time Travelers Weekend"" where costume players of all genres (science fiction, comic books, etc.) are invited to time travel to the renaissance; ""BrewFest"" weekend, ""Halloween Daze & Spooky Knights"" weekend, and ""Pirate's Christmas"" weekend.

History
The festival began in 1977, as a much smaller festival. For its first 23 seasons it was operated primarily as a benefit for the Kansas City Art Institute, rather than as a business. In 1999 it was purchased by Mid-America Festivals, which also operates the Minnesota Renaissance Festival, and turned into a much larger business concern.
The Kansas City Renaissance Festival, in addition to being sold to new ownership in the late 1990s and the tremendous growth it has encountered, has also faced the extreme possibility of having to shut down and move in the early part of the 21st century. There was talk in 2003 during a lease fight with Wyandotte County, Kansas, a scenario in which the Festival ownership and management gave serious thought to relocating the festival and taking every structure and sign with them. Ultimately, the lease fight was resolved with Mid-America Festivals signing a new long-term lease and agreeing to keep the festival open in Bonner Springs for what they heralded at the time as ""another thirty years.""
The COVID-19 pandemic caused the 2020 season to be cancelled.

History
In the early 1970s, Minnesota lawyer Jules Smith Sr. (1930–2018) invested in George Coulam's Minnesota Renaissance Festival. A few years later,  Coulam left the Minnesota festival and started the Texas Renaissance Festival, and Smith sold his shares in the Minnesota festival and organized a similar festival in Maryland, near Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia. The fair was first held for four weekends in 1977 and drew 17,000 people to see performances by Penn and Teller and The Flying Karamazov Brothers among others. In 1985, the fair was moved to its current location in Crownsville and in 1986 Smith turned over the management of the fair to his son Jules Smith Jr., who still runs the festival with three siblings. The festival was originally an Elizabethan fair, but in 1989 switched to being focused on Henry VIII of England. King Henry is played by actor Fred Nelson, replacing Bill Huttel, after Huttel's death in 2001.
On July 22, 2020, the Maryland Renaissance Festival announced that it would not operate in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Fair
The English Tudor village is 27 acres (110,000 m2) of woods and fields. There are more than 130 craft shops and 42 food outlets.
More than 1,300 participants populate the village, 400 work directly for the company, 700 for the other vendors and 200 as performers on stages or as characters throughout the village. The Maryland Renaissance Festival utilizes eight major theaters, four smaller stages in taverns, a children's area, and a jousting tiltyard with seating for 3,000.

Travel to the Festival
The Minnesota Renaissance Festival had provided free parking at its site near Shakopee, but due to increasing traffic problems in 2023 they began limiting the number of vehicles using on-site parking by selling a limited number of date-specific parking vouchers. Directions are available from its website.  Parking is available in parking lots accessible by two dirt roads, one from highway 41 and the other from highway 169, onto its 400-acre campus.  Limited access to and from the festival site has led to significant transportation issues including delays as long as two hours either entering or leaving the fairgrounds. Traffic problems have created significant backups and delays along Minnesota Highway 169 with traffic being identified as the number one issue.
In the 1980s, the Minnesota Transportation Museum provided train trips to the Renaissance Festival using Northern Pacific 328. These trains used Chicago & North Western Railway tracks between Minneapolis and Merriam Junction, which is located next to the Renaissance Festival grounds. The rail line was severed between Hopkins and Chaska in 1991.

The 65-acre (260,000 m2) faire comprises permanent structures and has twenty stages and more than 100 shops. 
As of 2024, the fair runs on Saturdays and Sundays beginning in mid-August, plus Labor Day Monday.

History
The New York Renaissance Faire was originally called the New York Renaissance Festival created in 1978 by Barbara Hope and Donald Gaiti. In 1996, Hope and Gaiti, merged with Renaissance Entertainment Corp. which acquired Creative Faires Ltd., the company that owned and operated the faire. The faire became the fifth to be owned by Renaissance Entertainment Corporation.

Attractions
Like many other faires, the faire has a different storyline that changes with each year. Some weekends are themed, such as one aimed towards pirates.
The faire is a training ground for stage and screen actors who use the opportunity to grow in their careers. The actors spend two months preparing for the faire. The faire is also known for its charity work in reading programs and blood donations.
Several weeks after the faire ends, Hope & Gaiti introduced a Halloween-themed event called the Forest of Fear in 1993. It runs every Friday, Saturday and Sunday night in October. In 2018, the primary building for this event sustained damage from heavy rains. The Forest of Fear Facebook page announced to fans that they would not operate that year. The attraction has not run since. The website appears to be down for maintenance.

Allegations of hostile workplace environment
In Fall 2019, News 12 ran a segment on Turn To Tara covering the allegedly hostile work environment. News 12 obtained a leaked copy of the directors' daily discrepancy reports from the summer 2018 season. The segment describes allegations from previous and present works that ""sexual misconduct, performer in-fighting and substance abuse are rampant."" Management did not comment. 
In January 2020, News 12 again covered this issue, airing an interview with a former performer and manager who was responsible for a 30-person cast the summer of 2019. She alleges a hostile and unsafe working environment, saying ""a lot of the women would often, when we got together, would share things that were said to us, inappropriate things."" A striking example: ""there was a 17-year-old cast member who came to me because one of the directors there said something that was sexually suggestive. She was humiliated by it and didn't know how to ask for help. I feel like it was behavior tolerated for so long it just became accepted.""
The leadership team did not comment directly. Their lawyer, in a letter to News 12, describes this as a non-story. They wrote, ""The culture at NYRF is anything but sexually hostile. The NYRF has a strong anti-sexual harassment policy, and provides comprehensive sexual harassment training.”

Performance series
In recent years, the festival has expanded its calendar of events to include additional programs for families. In 2006, UNCSA's School of Drama produced its first family musical, You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown and a new Saturday Night at the Movies series.  First produced in 2007, the Rock the Boat! series invites families to relax on the charming Manteo waterfront while UNCSA's conservatory-trained musicians perform aboard the Elizabeth II. In 2008, a newly created Classics for Kids series presents an hour of kid-focused music every Thursday afternoon and gives children an opportunity to interact with the musicians and their instruments. In addition, the films on Saturday nights move from the Film Theater to the big outdoor screen.

Outdoor Pavilion Series
Feature presentations vary each summer.  Shows are at 8 pm at the Outdoor Pavilion for four consecutive nights, Tuesday through Friday. Traditionally, each week of the season presents a different program presented by the Schools of Drama, Music, Dance or Film.  In recent years the UNCSA School of Drama has expanded its presentations to include a Shakespeare comedy, a family musical and a cabaret performed in repertoire during three weeks of the festival. The School of Music presentations may include concerts by the UNCSA orchestra or by UNCSA ensembles for jazz, ragtime, percussion, woodwinds or brass.  The School of Dance presents a program of classical and contemporary dance often featuring new and juried works by UNCSA alumni.  The School of Filmmaking presents films on Saturday nights selected for a family audience. All shows are designed and produced by the faculty and students from UNCSA's School of Design and Production.

Afternoon Classics Series
Casual classical concerts are offered on Tuesday and Friday afternoons at 2 pm in the Film Theater.  Programs vary daily and weekly.  Music for guitars, saxophones, vocalists, woodwinds, strings, brass, or percussion may be featured with repertoire ranging from jazz to classical by American and international composers.

Wild Wednesday! Series
Excerpts from the 8 pm feature performances may be heard every Wednesday at 2 pm in the Film Theater.  Audiences are encouraged to meet the performers and ask questions about life as a student at UNCSA.

Rock the Boat! Series
On Wednesdays at 7 pm, musicians aboard the Elizabeth II perform a 30-minute concert to boaters, pedestrians and diners on the [Manteo] waterfront.

Classics for Kids Series
On Thursdays at 2 pm, musicians present programs designed especially for kids in the Film Theater.  Kids are invited to participate and interact with the performers.

Saturday Night at the Movies Film Series
The School of Filmmaking selects films for a family audience ranging from classic Charlie Chaplin films to contemporary animation.  Films are shown at 8 pm on the big outdoor screen at Roanoke Island Festival Park's Outdoor Pavilion.

Fourth of July celebration
Now an Outer Banks tradition, Roanoke Island Festival Park, the Town of Manteo and UNCSA honors America's independence with an evening of patriotic music and dazzling fireworks.  Music begins at 8 pm and continues during the fireworks beginning at dark. Families and groups are encouraged to come early to picnic at the park.

CAP for kids
Introduced in 2007, the festival offers a program to encourage young patrons to attend shows for performing artists.  Kids can become a Community Arts Patron or CAP by attending at three least shows.  CAP punch cards are available at each performance and may be redeemed for prizes when children present their CAP card at their third show.

Festival alumni
Festival performers often make headlines soon after they perform in Manteo.  In addition to playing in orchestras and on stages worldwide, recent alumni have won the Metropolitan Opera's National Finalist award, performed on Broadway, played in the Grammy orchestra, acted in films and TV series and joined professional dance companies like Limon, Pilobolus, and American Ballet Theatre.

Overview
The Oregon Shakespeare Festival (OSF) is a regional repertory theatre in Ashland, Oregon, United States, founded in 1935 by Angus L. Bowmer. From late April through December each year, the Festival now offers 800 to 850 matinee and evening performances of a wide range of classic and contemporary plays not limited to Shakespeare to a total annual audience of nearly 400,000. The Festival welcomed its millionth visitor in 1971, its 10-millionth in 2001, and its 20-millionth visitor in 2015. At any given time between five and eleven plays are offered in daily rotation six days a week in its three theatres.
Each year, two or three plays are staged in the outdoor Allen Elizabethan Theatre, two or three in the intimate Thomas Theatre, and four or five in the traditional Angus Bowmer Theatre. OSF has completed the entire Shakespeare canon of 37 plays in 1958, 1978, 1997, and 2016. Since 1960, it has also offered non-Shakespearean plays. Since 2000 there has been at least one new work each season from playwrights such as Octavio Solis and Robert Schenkkan, several of which have gone on to other venues and numerous awards (see below). A complete list by year and theatre is available here: Production history of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. OSF also provides a broad range of educational programs for middle schools, high schools, college students, teachers, and theatre professionals.

History
In 1893, the residents of Ashland built a facility to host Chautauqua events. In its heyday, it accommodated audiences of 1,500 for appearances by the likes of John Philip Sousa and William Jennings Bryan during annual 10-day seasons.
In 1917, a new domed structure was built at the site, but it fell into disrepair after the Chautauqua movement died out in the 1920s. In 1935, the similarity of the remaining wall of the then-roofless Chautauqua building to Elizabethan theatres inspired Southern Oregon University drama professor Angus L. Bowmer to propose using it to present plays by Shakespeare. Ashland city leaders loaned him a sum ""not to exceed $400"" (approximately equivalent to $7,459 in 2019) to present two plays as part of the city's Independence Day celebration. However, they pressed Bowmer to add boxing matches to cover the expected deficit. Bowmer agreed, feeling such an event was in perfect keeping with the bawdiness of Elizabethan theatre. The Works Progress Administration helped construct a makeshift Elizabethan stage on the Chautauqua site, and confidently billing it as the ""First Annual Oregon Shakespearean Festival"", Bowmer presented Twelfth Night on July 2 and July 4, 1935, and  The Merchant of Venice on July 3, directing and playing the lead roles in both plays himself. Reserved seats cost $1, with general admission of $.50 for adults and $.25 for children (approximately equivalent to $19, $9, and $5 in 2019). Ironically, the profit from the plays covered the losses the boxing matches incurred.
The Festival has continued ever since (excepting 1941–1946 while Bowmer served in World War II and most of 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic). It quickly developed a reputation for quality productions. Angus Bowmer's first wife Lois served as art director, creating both costumes and scenery during the formative years of the Festival from 1935 to 1940. In 1939, OSF took a production of  The Taming of the Shrew to the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco that was nationally broadcast on radio. The lead actress, learning at the last minute the broadcast would be to a national audience, suffered a panic attack, was rushed to the hospital, and the stand-in took over. The scripts didn't arrive on the set until three minutes before air time. The Festival achieved widespread national recognition when, from 1951 to 1973, under the direction of Andrew C. Love (1894–1987), NBC broadcast abbreviated performances each year that were carried by more than 100 stations nationally and, after 1954, on Armed Forces Radio and Radio Free Europe. The programs won favorable reviews from critics that drew audiences to the Festival from around the country. The programs led Life magazine to do a story on the Festival in 1957, bringing even more people to the plays. The NBC programs and the subsequent attention go a long way to explaining how a tiny out-of-the-way timber town in the Northwest became a theatrical and tourist Mecca.
Angus L. Bowmer retired in 1971, and leadership of the Festival passed to Jerry Turner, who widened the Festival repertory to production of classics by the likes of Molière, Ibsen, and Chekhov. When Turner retired in 1991, actor/director Henry Woronicz took control through 1996. OSF then recruited Libby Appel from the highly respected Indiana Repertory Theatre. She served as Artistic Director from 1996 through 2007. Bill Rauch succeeded Libby Appel as Artistic Director, serving from 2008 to 2019. He incorporated musicals and non-western plays into the annual selection, and sought connections between classic plays and contemporary concerns. He also started the Black Swan Lab in which 15–20 OSF actors developed new works for the stage. Inspired by Shakespeare's 37 plays, Rauch also initiated a 10-year program to commission up to 37 new plays collectively called American Revolutions: The United States History Cycle, 32 of which have been commissioned and ten of these have reached the stage, several to great acclaim including Tony awards. Nataki Garrett was selected to be the next artistic director in April of 2019, with 2020 to be her first full season.
Bing Crosby served as an honorary director of the Festival from 1949 to 1951. Charles Laughton visited in 1961, saying ""I have just seen the four best productions of Shakespeare that I have ever seen in my life."" Laughton begged to play King Lear, but died in 1962 before he could fulfill the dream. Stacy Keach was a cast member in 1962 and 1963. Duke Ellington and his orchestra presented a benefit concert in 1966 that brought many luminaries to Ashland.
1952 saw the birth of a tradition following the curtain call ending the last outdoor play of each season. Company members, not just actors, each carrying a candle, silently enter the darkened theatre to the traditional English folk tune Greensleeves. A company member selected for the honor speaks Prospero's words from Act IV Scene I of the Tempest beginning, ""Our revels now are ended. These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits and Are melted into air, into thin air…"" On completion of the speech, all extinguish the flames and file silently out of the theatre.
The tradition of opening the outdoor season with a Feast of Will (originally the Feasting of the Tribe of Will) was initiated in 1956 in Lithia Park with Miss Oregon and then-state senator Mark Hatfield attending.
The City of Portland approached OSF in the late 1970s about joining the art scene there, leading to the building of a new center in Portland. In 1986, OSF was again approached about producing in the new Portland Center for the Performing Arts, leading to the launch in November 1988 of a season of five plays including Shaw's Heartbreak House and Shakespeare's Pericles, Prince of Tyre, the first of four productions that transferred to or from Ashland. At the invitation of the City of Portland, OSF established a resident theatre in the Portland Center for the Performing Arts in 1988. It became independent in 1994 as Portland Center Stage. Those six seasons ran November–April, allowing many OSF company members to work in both cities. In 1990–1991 Portland imported rotating repertory from OSF, a company of 10 actors performing 43 roles.
In 1986, the OSF received the President's Volunteer Action Award; in 1987 it initiated Daedalus, a fundraiser to help victims of HIV/AIDS that has continued annually ever since.
A second theatre, the indoor Angus Bowmer Theatre (see below), opened in 1970, enabling OSF to expand its season into the spring and fall; within a year, attendance tripled to 150,000.  By 1976, the festival was filling 99% of its seats while offering some 275 performances of eight plays each season. In 1977, the Festival opened a third theatre, dubbed the Black Swan (see below), in what originally was an auto dealership, and attendance reached 300,000. By 1979, the year Bowmer died, the Festival was offering  the now customary 11 plays a season.
In 1983 OSF won both its first Tony Award for outstanding achievement in regional theatre and the National Governors' Association Award for its distinguished service to the arts, the first ever to a performing arts organization. In 1988, the Oregon Shakespearean Festival was renamed the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.
In 1997, the OSF-commissioned The Magic Fire was presented at the John F. Kennedy Center and named by Time among the year's best plays. In 2002, the Thomas Theatre (see below) replaced the Black Swan as the venue for intimate or experimental productions in a Black box theatre. In 2003, Time named OSF as the second best regional theatre in the United States (Chicago's Goodman Theater was first).
The Festival opened the 2020 season on February 28 with performances of A Midsummer Night's Dream, Peter and the Starcatcher, and The Copper Children in the Angus Bowmer Theatre. Bring Down the House (a two-part adaptation of Shakespeare’s Henry VI plays) was presented in the Thomas Theatre. However, on March 11 the Covid-19 pandemic forced closing of OSF for the rest of the season.
With the pandemic seeming to moderate, the Shakespeare Festival announced an April to December schedule of live performances for 2022 as follows. Once on This Island in the Angus Bowmer Theatre, unseen in the Thomas Theatre, How I Learned What I Learned, in the Angus Bowmer Theatre, The Tempest in the Allen Elizabethan Theatre, Revenge Song in the Allen Elizabethan Theatre, King John in the Angus Bowmer Theatre, Confederates in the Thomas Theatre, It’s Christmas, Carol! in the Angus Bowmer Theatre. In addition, OSF presented The Cymbeline Project, a multi-episode, digital adaptation of the Shakespeare play.
In April 2023, OSF announced an emergency fundraising campaign as the company was in financial crisis and needed to raise $2.5 million to continue the season as planned.  By June, the fundraising effort had exceeded its goal. Artistic director Nataki Garrett resigned on May 5, 2023, with Octavio Solis stepping in to help search for a replacement. Tim Bond of TheatreWorks Silicon Valley was named new artistic director on July 6, 2023. Tim had previously served as an associate artistic director under Libby Appel.
The complete record of all OSF plays can be found in a separate article, Production history of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.

Green Show
In addition to the plays, since 1951 a free outdoor ""Green Show"" drawing audiences in the hundreds, often including non-playgoers, precedes the evening plays from June through September, Wednesday through Saturday nights, from a modular steel stage with a sprung floor for the dancers, a removable wheelchair ramp for performers with disabilities, and built-in storage facilities that eliminate carting equipment from and to distant storage facilities. Originally, it offered Elizabethan music and dancers. From 1966 until 2007 it consisted of three Renaissance-themed shows in rotation inspired by the plays showing in the Allen Elizabethan Theatre.  Beginning in 1990, live music was supplied by resident ensemble The Terra Nova Consort, with numerous guest musicians, and Elizabethan dancers. In 1998, Terra Nova was joined by modern dance troupe Dance Kaleidoscope. This collaboration continued through 2007.
In still another innovation by Bill Rauch, the Green Show was revamped in 2008. The shows now vary widely with performers such as a dance group from Mexico or India one night, clowns doing ballet on stilts the next, and a classical music quartet on another. A fire show, juggler, or magician might be seen along with improv, metal, or rock-n-roll variations on Shakespeare. Individual performers, groups, choirs, bands, and orchestras may present Afro-Cuban, baroque, blues, classical, contemporary, cowboy, funk, gospel, hip-hop, jazz, mariachi, marimba, poetry, marionette, renaissance, or salsa, sometimes combined in unexpected ways.

Economic importance
As suggested by the table below, OSF has a major economic impact in a town of only 20,000. That impact stems from direct sales of tickets but also expenditures at some 125 restaurants (a variety and density per resident similar to that in New York and Paris), hotels and motels in Ashland, and shops (second to last row of the table). These in turn create further economic activity, the economists’ “multiplier effect” that measures how often each dollar is spent on further local goods and services, estimated at 2.9 for OSF, resulting in the figures shown in bottom row of the table.

Differences from year to year are largely accounted for by variations in seating configurations in the theaters and total number of performances including occasional cancellation of outdoor performances due to wind born smoke from distant forest fires, particularly in 2018.
In addition to its economic importance to the region, OSF is an active community member. It often participates in Ashland's Martin Luther King celebration, Juneteenth celebration of the Emancipation Proclamation, and Fourth of July Parade. The Green Show is free. The Daedalus Project, managed by company members since 1987 in support of HIV/AIDS charitable organizations, traditionally featured a morning fun run, an afternoon play reading, an ""arts and treasures"" sale and an evening variety show and underwear parade.
In 2016, the Festival hosted the fifth biennial national Asian American Theater Conference and Festival. In addition to a full slate of conference sessions during the week, the event included six original plays, five play readings, and three Green Shows (see above). Participants also had an opportunity to see several regular Festival performances, two of which had an Asian setting and one an Asian-American theme.

OSF campus
The Oregon Shakespeare Festival occupies a 4-acre (16,000 m2) campus adjacent to Lithia Park and the Plaza in Ashland, Oregon. The primary buildings are the three theatres, Carpenter Hall, and the Camps, Pioneer, and Administration buildings, all surrounding an open central court locally known as ""The Bricks"" that ties everything together into an architecturally coherent whole and facilitates movement. It also provides a stage for the nightly Green Shows (see above) from June through September.  The Black Swan (G), now serves as a laboratory for the development of new plays. Off-campus buildings include the production facility, classrooms, the Hay Patton Rehearsal Center, and costume storage and rental facilities described below.

Allen Elizabethan Theatre
The Allen Elizabethan Theatre has evolved since the founding of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival when the first performance of Twelfth Night was presented on July 2, 1935.

Original Elizabethan Theatre
The design for the first outdoor OSF Elizabethan Theatre was sketched by Angus L. Bowmer based on his recollection of productions at the University of Washington in which he had acted while a student. Ashland, Oregon obtained WPA funds in 1935 to build it within the 12-foot (3.7 m) circular walls that remained in the roofless shell of the abandoned Chautauqua theatre. Bowmer extended the walls to reduce the stage width to fifty-five feet, and painted the extensions to resemble half-timbered buildings. He designed a thrust stage—one projecting toward the audience—with a balcony. Two columns helped divide the main stage into forestage, middle stage, and inner stage areas. Illustrating the improvised nature of it all, actors doubled as stage hands, stage lighting was housed in coffee cans, and string beans were planted along the walls to improve sound quality. Fifty-cent general admission seating was on benches just behind the one-dollar reserved seating on folding chairs. This theatre was torn down during World War II.

Second Elizabethan Theatre
The second outdoor Elizabethan Theatre was built in 1947 from plans drawn up by University of Washington drama professor John Conway. The main stage became trapezoidal, with entries added on either side, and windows added above them flanking the balcony stage.  A low railing gave a finished appearance to the forestage. Chairs arranged to improve sight lines replaced bench seating. Backstage areas were added gradually and haphazardly, until the ramshackle result was ordered torn down as a fire hazard in 1958.

Current Allen Elizabethan Theatre
The next year saw the opening of the current outdoor theatre, whose name was changed from Elizabethan to Allen Elizabethan Theatre in October 2013.  Patterned on London's 1599 Fortune Theatre and designed by  Richard L. Hay, it incorporated all the stage dimensions mentioned in the Fortune contract. The trapezoidal stage was retained but the façade was extended to three stories, resulting in a forestage, middle stage, inner below, inner above (the old balcony), and a musicians' gallery. The wings were provided with second-story windows.  Each provides acting areas, creating many staging possibilities. A pitched, shingled roof enhances the half-timbered façade. A windowed gable was extended from the center of the roof to cover and define the middle stage. Just before each performance, an actor opens the gable window, and in keeping with Elizabethan tradition signaling a play in progress, runs a flag up the pole to the sound of a trumpet and doffs his cap to the audience.
The result is an approximate replica of the Fortune Theatre. The known but incomplete dimensions apply only to the stage. The original specifications sometimes say no more than ""to be built like the Globe,"" for which there are no plans or details. The remotely operated lighting, on scaffolding on either side of the stage, of course did not exist in the original, and the current site rather than the original architecture largely determined the shape of the auditorium. Twelve hundred seats in slightly offset arcs ascend the original hillside, giving an excellent view of the stage from each seat. The old Chautauqua theatre walls, now ivy-covered, remain as the outer perimeter of the theatre.
The $7.6 million Paul Allen Pavilion was added in 1992. It houses a control room, and audience services including rental of infrared hearing devices, blankets, pillows, and food and drink, both of which are allowed in the auditorium.  Several hundred seats were moved to a balcony and two boxes, further improving sightlines and acoustics. Vomitoria (colloquially, ""voms""), the traditional name for entryways for actors from under the seating area, were added and the lighting scaffolds were eliminated.

Angus Bowmer Theatre
An April 1968 report by the Bureau of Business and Economic Research of the University of Oregon pointed to the lost economic opportunity represented by the thousands of people the Oregon Shakespeare Festival was turning away each year. It further noted that the Festival had become an important economic engine for southern Oregon, and recommended addition of an indoor theatre. This led the City of Ashland to apply to the Economic Development Administration of the Department of Commerce in Fall 1968 for a $1,792,000 project grant with the Angus Bowmer Theatre as the keystone. The plan also called for a parking building, a remodeled administration building and box office, a scene shop and exhibit hall that later would become the OSF Black Swan, landscaping, and street realignment. $896,000 was approved in April 1969, to match an equal amount to be raised through private donations. The fund drive quickly exceeded its goal and ground for the new theatre was broken on December 18, 1969.
The theatre was ready just five months later and opened with a production of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, selected to recognize the Shakespearean origin of the Festival but to signal Festival readiness to broaden its horizons by incorporating modern plays into its repertoire. Reinforcing that signal, The Fantasticks and You Can't Take it with You were also presented during that first six-week season.
The Angus Bowmer Theatre seats between 592 and 610 patrons depending on configuration.  Although about half the size of the outdoor theatre, it more than doubled audience capacity by making it possible to hold matinee performances and to extend the season into spring and fall.
The design by Richard L. Hay and architects Kirk, Wallace and McKinley of Seattle and contractor Robert D. Morrow, Inc., of Salem, Oregon was at once basic, flexible, functional, and innovative. All seats are within 55 feet (17 m) of the stage, arranged with only two side aisles and wide spaces between rows. Dark colors resist reflection and draw the eye to the stage. The forestage is on a hydraulic lift system that can emulate the thrust stage of the OSF Allen Elizabethan Theatre, form a more conventional proscenium front that can move below auditorium floor level to form an orchestra pit, or drop two stories for storage of equipment or scenery. The walls of the auditorium can swing in to close down the playing area or open to accommodate larger productions.

Illustrating these characteristics, the first picture is the set for August Wilson's Fences. The second, taken two hours later on the same stage, is the set for the ancient Hindu classic The Clay Cart. Stage crews for the two indoor theatres must complete set changes of this scope six days a week between the end of a matinee and the ""call"" before the evening curtain and again the next morning in time for the matinee (the outdoor stage changes daily). This illustrates the nature of true repertory theater, which allows the playgoer to see different plays on the same day on the same stage, but requires designing and making sets to withstand constant rapid assembly, disassembly and return to accessible storage to await the next change of set. It also requires actors able to simultaneously play different parts in very different plays.
Just two hours before the 18 June 2011 matinee a crack was discovered in the seventy-foot long, six and one-half foot high main ceiling support beam of the Bowmer Theatre. Shows were immediately relocated to other venues as work progressed to repair the beam. A 598-seat tent, ""Bowmer in the Park,"" was soon erected in Lithia Park adjacent to the Festival campus as a temporary replacement venue. A single set was designed and built to serve four very different shows, and the shows themselves were re-staged while keeping the artistic vision of each as intact as possible. Thirty-one performances were held in the tent and averaged 82% of capacity, generating approximately $650,000 in revenue against approximately $800,000 for the tent itself, $1,000,000 in lost revenue from ticket returns, and $330,000 in repair costs. The Bowmer reopened on 2 August, a month ahead of the initial estimate. The Festival filed an insurance claim for $3.58 million and received checks in March 2012 for $330,000 to cover the cost of repairs and $2.984 million covering much of the lost revenue, leaving about $200,000, primarily representing the cost of the temporary tent theatre itself, unresolved.

Black Swan
The Black Swan (G on the OSF campus map above) served as the Festival's third theatre from 1977 to 2001. The building, originally an automobile dealership, was bought in 1969 as a scene shop and rehearsal hall. Company members began using it to stage ""midnight"" readings for one another and invited friends who brought other friends. Artistic Director Jerry Turner recognized the opportunity to take risks with unconventional staging and subjects, and called for its development as a third OSF theatre. Fitting a theatre into the existing building was challenging. It could hold only 138 seats, all within five rows of the stage. There had to be, as designer Richard Hay put it, a ""certain amount of tucking and squeezing."" Each director had to solve the problem of an immovable roof support in the middle of the stage. For instance, in one production, it became a crucifix after adding a horizontal piece.  The theatre reverted to its earlier roles in 2002 when it was replaced by the New Theatre, now renamed the Thomas Theatre.  Among those roles are rehearsal space, meeting and audition rooms, classes, and since 2011 as a home for the Black Swan Lab (see above).

Thomas Theatre
The limitations stemming from adapting an existing building as the Black Swan led to the design and building of a third theatre that provided flexible seating and increased capacity while maintaining the intimacy of the Black Swan. Opened in March 2002 and originally named the New Theatre, it was renamed the Thomas Theatre in 2013 as a result of a generous $4.5 million gift from a group of donors. The name recognizes the contributions of longtime OSF development director Peter Thomas, who died in March 2010. The Thomas Theatre expands the possibilities for experiment and innovation while maintaining the intimacy of the Black Swan, no seat being more than six rows from the stage. Richard L. Hay designed the theatre space. Architects Thomas Hacker and Associates of Portland designed the building. The contractor was Emerick Construction, and acoustical engineering was provided by Dohn and Associates. The seats can be arranged in three configurations. In arena mode, a stage of 663 square feet (61.6 m2) is surrounded on all four sides by 360 seats. In three-quarter thrust mode, a 710 square feet (66 m2) stage is surrounded on three sides by 270 seats, and in avenue mode, a 1,236 square feet (114.8 m2) stage provides 228 seats on two sides. There is a trap room under the stage and a fly loft at one end. A computer controls 300 circuits and over 400 lights of various types. The remainder of the building is given over to downstairs and upstairs lobbies, concessions, access distribution, archives (see below), storage, laundry room, green room, quiet room, warm-up room, dressing space for 18 actors, showers/restrooms, costume and wig rooms, stage manager's office, maintenance space, and storage for props and set pieces.

The Box Office (J on the OSF campus map above) is on the same courtyard as the Thomas Theatre. The Festival acquired the Administration Building (C) in April 1967. Forming the northern boundary of the campus, the building houses the artistic, business, community productions, development, education, group sales, literary (D), human resources offices, development, and the mailroom. The adjacent Camps Building (A) houses the members' lounge, communications and marketing offices, and a meeting room.
The Festival's costume production shop occupies the Pioneer Building at the northwest corner of campus and an annex in the Administration building. The staff creates the costumes and accessories in three main studios on the lower floor of the building and in an extension of the Administration Building. Also in this area are offices and fitting rooms for the costume designers and costume design assistants, a costume props area and a vented paint room. Upstairs is a dye room, lounge, laundry, storage room, and office. During the height of costume production each season, a wig shop and additional studio is open in the basement of the Angus Bowmer Theatre.

The Festival acquired Carpenter Hall (I) in October 1973, renovating it to accommodate lectures, concerts, rehearsals, meetings and Festival and community events. The Bill Patton Garden (K) provides the venue for free informal summer noon talks by OSF actors and staff. The Tudor Guild operated the Tudor Guild Gift Shop (B) and Brass Rubbing Center (K) for many years, both now operated by OSF itself, and will facilitate campus tours beginning in 2022. Just off campus, a purpose-equipped fitness center helps actors stay fit for physically demanding roles that often require acrobatics, fights, and pratfalls.
In November 2013 the Festival completed the $7.2 million purpose-built 71,544 square feet (6,646.7 m2) (6,646.7 m2) Production Building in neighboring Talent, Oregon now home to a multi-function staff.  The building houses custom-designed technologically advanced set and prop construction and scene painting facilities. The scene shop has an extensive pit area that precisely duplicates the trap doors in the theatres themselves, allowing for precise sizing, testing of assembly and disassembly, and automating elevator cues. Lighting in the painting areas duplicates that in the theatres, guaranteeing desired colors. The building also houses OSF's costume warehouse and rental business, which has over 50,000 costumes and over 15,000 costume props such as armor, crowns, and wigs available for rent by other theatres, television and movie producers, and corporations.
With the removal of the scene construction shop in 2014 to the new Production Building, a thirteen-month transformation began of the old one into the Hay-Patton Rehearsal Center by demolishing everything except the masonry exterior and the steel framework and raising the second floor three feet. Following a plan developed by Ogden Roemer Wilkerson Architecture carried out by Adroit Construction at a cost of $4.4 million, it hosted its first rehearsal on 29 December 2015. The building is equipped with a sophisticated sound system and has six rehearsal halls, three of them some 3,000-square-foot (280 m2), sufficient to precisely duplicate stages in any of the three Festival theatres. All six include fully sprung floors to prevent injuries when dancing, rehearsing stage combat, or similar physical activities. The LED lighting system is zoned and dimmable, the ceilings have steel tracks which allow for suspension of scenery, lights, loudspeakers, and even people.  Some have additional features such as small conversation areas and dance-style mirrors. The building also includes a stage management office, a recording studio, a movement studio focused on the Feldenkrais Method, a studio for work on vocal technique, stamina, and dialect; a loading dock, a conference room, showers, two warmup spaces that double as small meeting rooms, two green rooms equipped with refrigerator, storage cases, sink, dishwasher, tables custom-made by the prop shop, and chairs.

Organization
OSF is a non-profit corporation managed under US and Oregon law by a 32-member Board of Directors nominated and elected for eight-year terms. The endowment itself has a net worth in excess of $30 million that returns about $1.2 million to support the annual operating budget. It is managed by seven trustees who are selected for five-year terms by the Board of Directors.
In the past, OSF offered non-voting memberships at eleven levels beginning at $35, each with its own privileges. Starting in 2022, these have been replaced by a Change Makers donor program in eight categories starting at one dollar and providing for deep engagement. To further extend access to as many people as possible, 2022 ticket prices were reduced and now range from $35 to $75.

Professional staff
The paid staff is organized into artistic, production, education, administrative and development sections.
The Artistic Director selects the plays and directors for each season and chooses 70-120 actors, musicians and dancers. In August 2019, Nataki Garrett succeeded Bill Rauch as the sixth artistic director of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. She earned her MFA in directing from the California Institute of the Arts and has more than 20 years experience as a theatre administrator, director, producer, playwright, educator, activist and mentor, most recently as acting artistic director of the Denver Center for the Performing Arts and Associate Dean of the undergraduate acting program at California Institute of the Arts School of Theater. Her forté and passion are fostering and developing new work. She has produced over 150 mainstage, black box, and developmental projects including world premieres of Book of Will, Two Degrees, Zoe's Perfect Wedding, The Great Leap, and American Mariachi. She directed the world premiere of Pussy Valley, and the U.S. premieres of Jefferson's Garden and BLKS. In her first effort in her new position, she directed the imaginatively staged 2019 Oregon Shakespeare production of How to Catch Creation. 
Once the plays have opened, the voice and text staff are on hand to help actors with vocal challenges that may arise, attend periodic performances to provide helpful ideas, work with understudies, teach voluntary voice classes to the acting company, provide ongoing professional development support in the form of project or individual session work, and participate in play selection and workshops for upcoming seasons.
Each play is also assigned an Intimacy Director, who works to ensure that actors feel emotionally and mentally safe when performing in intimate and emotionally demanding scenes, while also working to realize the director’s vision.
Programs specifically for teachers have included the five-day retreat, ""Shakespeare in the Classroom"" that emphasizes innovative and pedagogical methods to help teachers make the works of Shakespeare involving and accessible to contemporary students.
For those unable to come to the Festival, pairs of actors participate in the School Visit Program, initiated in 1971, which now reaches some 60,000 students primarily in four states, although it has made occasional visits to eight others. Each one-day visit includes two 50-minute performances and one two-hour or two one-hour workshops. Performances are a condensed version of one Shakespeare play, selected scenes from Shakespeare illustrating a single theme, or a combination of Shakespeare and other literature selected to meet the needs of the school being visited.
A partnership with Ashland High School initiated by student actors in 1993 grew into a rich and enduring relationship for students and Festival professionals that has produced a significant number not just of actors but of theatre professionals over the years.
Programs of different lengths and formality to meet varied adult needs and interests have included Wake Up With Shakespeare, Shakespeare Comprehensive, Festival Noons, Prefaces, Prologues, Park Talks, Road Scholars, and ""Unfolding Seminars.""
OSF's Development Department has also educational opportunities through tours that have included two to England focused on Shakespeare, one to Greece and Turkey on Holland America Line's MS Rotterdam focused on the beginnings and history of theatre, and one along the coasts of France and Spain and to the Canary Islands on Cunard Line's Queen Mary 2. These tours feature an intensive schedule of lectures and interactive workshops with four to eight OSF staff and actors, as well as visits to local attractions.
The Administrative staff is supervised Acting Executive Director David Schmitz who follows past Executive Directors Paul Christy (2019–2020), Cynthia Rider (2013–2018), Paul Nicholson (1995–2012) and William Patton (1955–1995).
Administration supervises the physical plant (custodial services, maintenance, and security), accounting, IT, mail room, and receptionists. The Director of Marketing and Communications supervises the box office, membership services, archives (see below), publications and media, marketing, and audience services, which itself includes house managers, ushers, concessions, and access staff for handicapped patrons (see below). The Director of Development supervises institutional giving, major gifts, and the Change Makers donor program. The Director of Human Resources manages employees, volunteer and events programs (see below), safety, and a professional development program called FAIR (Fellowships, Assistantships, Internships, and Residencies) that provides students aspiring to a career in theatre with direct experience of best practices across all aspects of professional theatre. Fellows work directly with senior management while expanding their personal networks. Three residencies varying from four to eleven months are exclusive to the Dramaturgy and Literary Management Department. Twenty-five to thirty Assistantships annually provide hands-on opportunities in virtually every area of the organization by pairing recipients with an appropriate OSF staff member for an average of three months. Finally, 15–20 annual unpaid Internships of two to four months each provide emerging artists and administrators with hands-on experience by pairing them with a Festival staff member in an area of interest. Internships may fulfill academic requirements determined by recipient's home academic institution.

Archives
OSF archivists develop, preserve, and maintain a comprehensive collection of documents and oral histories, drawings and photographs, audio and video recordings, and artifacts pertaining to the artistic and administrative history and heritage of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. Collecting, organizing, and preserving these materials of what otherwise is an ephemeral art form to archival standards is an ongoing effort aided in part by grants. The archives may be searched online.
Collections are available for research, although some collections have restrictions, and permission must be obtained for their use.
The Archives include Education department records from 1947 on and document the department's programming and structural evolution. Print materials include annual reports, brochures, calendars, correspondence, course handouts, course readings, news clippings, newsletters, photographs, posters, scripts, statistics and survey reports, study guides, and teacher information kits, guides, and resource kits. Audio and video recordings include radio broadcasts and school visit program performances.
In May 2013, the National Endowment for the Humanities awarded the Festival a $200,000 grant to digitize 2,649 deteriorating tapes, films and videos and to make them publicly available through its website and the YouTube platform. The collection spans the history of the Festival from its inception in 1935 through 2012 and comprises an unparalleled comprehensive record of Shakespearean and theatrical performance by a single U.S. theatre company. Included are full-length recordings of 541 of the 570 Festival productions from 1950 to 2012, including three or more varied interpretations of every play in the Shakespearean canon with exemplary casts before live audiences. The production recordings are supplemented by 44 adaptations broadcast on NBC radio, more than 100 hours of artist interviews, Shakespeare lectures by nationally and internationally renowned scholars and educators, production music, promotional recordings, and recordings of significant events in the company's history. Also included are the home movies of founder Angus Bowmer, Southern Oregon Normal School events and rare footage of the initial 1935 Festival season!

Volunteers
The professional staff is augmented by approximately 700 volunteers, who contribute thousands of hours each year. They have helped patrons as roving Bricks Ambassadors who welcomed visitors to the campus and answered their questions, staffed the Welcome Center and Green Show information table, facilitated informal post-matinee discussions, provided concierge services for visiting student groups, and served as volunteer ushers and ticket takers in the three theatres.
Behind the scenes, volunteers help in the archives, box office, costume shop, costume warehouse, development office, fitness center, light shop, mail room, marketing office, scene shop as well as with office tasks such as copying, filing, preparing mailings and sorting incoming mail. They transcribe interviews, help with actor auditions for visitors from other theatres and serve as attendants in the company fitness facility.
Volunteers assist with access services such as providing infrared hearing devices. They help with data collection for periodic audience surveys and staff numerous events that comprise the annual Daedalus fund raiser (see above), drive company vehicles on specific errands, and direct traffic during dismantling and movement of sets into storage at the end of the season.
Soroptimists Club members provide comfort items such as blankets, cushions, and ponchos in the outdoor theatre. Tudor Guild volunteers staff the brass rubbing center, theatre lobby merchandise counters, and gift shop. Housing aides deliver “welcome baskets” to visiting artists. Ashland Garden Club members provide floral arrangements for the annual Feast of Will celebration on the opening weekend of the Allen Elizabethan Theatre.
Each November, company members host a cocktail party and show titled Love's Labors thanking and celebrating the volunteers.

Publications
All playgoers are offered a complimentary Playbill with a synopsis of plays, casts, artist biographies, and directors' statements. Each year, the Festival publishes Teachers First! for school groups and Group Travel for adults, both providing information on the season's plays, including age suitability, the seasonal calendar, ordering, and discount information.
An annual Souvenir Program included photographic highlights of each play and special articles along with pictures and biographies of actors, playwrights, and the many people who work behind the scenes. A chart emphasizing the repertory nature of OSF lists all the actors and their parts in the plays.
The Festival also publishes a Bard Scorecard, a simple folder that lists all of William Shakespeare's plays, the years OSF produced them, and allows playgoers to check off which plays they've seen towards completing the canon.

Professional memberships
OSF is a constituent of Theatre Communications Group, the national service organization for the not-for-profit theatre world, and a member of the Shakespeare Theatre Association of America. It operates under contracts with Actors' Equity Association, The Union of Professional Actors and Stage Managers in the United States, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, and the Stage Directors and Choreographers Society, Inc., an independent national labor union.

History
In 1989, the Savannah OnStage International Arts Festival was founded by community leaders, fostered by the Savannah Chamber of Commerce, and administered by Elizabeth Stewart and Stewart Gordon. Until 2002, the week-long, multi-disciplinary arts festival brought performers to Savannah during a 10-day festival that included the week-long American Traditions Competition (ATC). In contrast to many vocal competitions focused on European repertoire, the ATC was dedicated to establishing the value and range of styles represented by 19th- and 20th-century American art songs and popular music. Under Stewart's leadership as Executive Director, Savannah OnStage grew and became a popular early springtime event in the city.In 2002, Rob Gibson was hired as Executive and Artistic Director, and the organization's name was changed to Savannah Music Festival (SMF). In 2003, Gibson enlisted Daniel Hope and Marcus Roberts as Associate Artistic Directors. Gibson had seen Hope perform with the Beaux Arts Trio in NYC and, after conversations about Hope's musical vision and artistic endeavors as a protege of Yehudi Menuhin, found him to be a good fit for SMF programming. Gibson had worked with Roberts since 1989, and Roberts' skills and commitment to jazz education made him a top choice to spearhead SMF's high school jazz band workshop and competition, Swing Central Jazz. Both Hope and Roberts have premiered new works at SMF and performed with various musicians, including Roberts' trio with Béla Fleck at SMF (2011) and a ""concerto for piano trio and orchestra"" performed with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra on April 6, 2013 (co-commissioned by ASO and SMF).
The COVID-19 pandemic caused the cancellation of the 32nd SMF in 2020, which was deferred to 2021.

Music Education
Since 2003, the Savannah Music Festival has developed a music education program.

Since 1976, it runs for seven consecutive weekends through July and August and features music, comedy, and interactive theatre performances as well as the work of artisans and craftspeople.
The COVID-19 pandemic caused the 45th festival to be cancelled in 2020; it was deferred to 2021.

Setting
The setting is the year 1585 in the fictional village of Warwick, which rambles across a wooded hillside and includes many permanent structures (some two-story) on the occasion of their annual festival. Queen Elizabeth is in attendance in the company of the members of her court, including various real-life historical figures, such as Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Francis Drake.  These ladies and gentlemen of the court perform shows, such as the human chess match and Tea with the Queen, in addition to interacting with patrons.  The entirety of village life is represented by the cast, known as the Wyldewood Players (formerly, the Bless-the-Mark Players). The cast of costumed actors portray all kinds of villagers; gypsies, pirates, washer-wenches and others.  They stroll the grounds, improvising scenarios to entertain the patrons.
Costumed entertainers include Renaissance musicians, bagpipers, illusionists, jugglers, sword-swallowers, fortune-tellers, and comedy acts.  Twice daily the performers join together in a parade through the Festival grounds, and the Festival closes each evening with a pub sing in which everyone is encouraged to sing along.
At the base of the west-facing hillside is the jousting field.  Here, full-contact jousting takes place, as well as displays of archery and (on Highland weekend) Highland games.  In addition, patrons can ride the war-horses of the jousters for a small fee.

Attractions
Stage shows
Sterling has a paid cast known as the Wyldewood Players, as well as musicians, acrobats, acting troupes, sword-swallowers, comedy acts, roving players who interact with patrons, and many more (see ""Performers"" below for a partial listing).

Arts and crafts
Like most Faires, the Sterling Renaissance Festival has a large number of artisans and craftspeople, such as glass-blowers, blacksmiths, bookbinders, and potters. Other vendors and wares include leather and costuming shops, weapons, custom footwear, walking sticks, musical instruments, jewelry, toys, and woodworking.

Games
There are also a number of games of skill available for an additional fee, such as archery, axe-throwing, ""Tomato Justice"" (where participants pelt a man with ripe tomatoes), the Ladder of Truth, and the Pillow Fyte.  Several human-powered rides are available.

Food
Various foods are available, including such Faire staples as turkey legs and shish-kabobs, but also including vegetarian items like portobello mushroom sandwiches and fresh fruit.  The Rose & Crown Tavern  (renamed in 2010 from the ""Bad Dog Tavern"") serves alcohol, including mead, and has a selection of meat pies, bacon-wrapped scallops, and other foods.  In the past, the Tavern has featured live entertainment.

Themed weekends
Each weekend has a formal theme that will often inform the storyline acted out by the townsfolk.  Current and past themes include Family Appreciation Weekend (discount tickets for families). Marketplace Weekend (purchases from vendors earn free tickets), Ale Fest Weekend, Highland Fling (Scottish music and competitions), Pirate Invasion, Romance Weekend, and Fantasy Weekend.

""Lost Warwick""
In the summer of 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of the regular season.  In response, creative director Gary Izzo teamed up with members of the regular cast and independent performers to write, produce, and film an original six-episode story entitled ""The Legend of Lost Warwick"".  The story follows the leading citizens of Sterling (the Lord and Lady Mayor, the Sheriff, and others) trying to plan for a pending visit from the Queen of England, when they realize that the entire village has mysteriously vanished.  New installments aired weekly on Saturday afternoons during what would have been the festival's usual run (July 11 through Aug. 15), with previous episodes becoming available for on-demand streaming.  There was also a live ""Tavern Talk"" episode on the preceding (Friday) evening.  Each Saturday episode not only furthered the story, but also showcased artisans, musicians, and stage shows, and was interspersed with live discussion from the Warwick Inn featuring a different special guest.  The show was filmed on the Festival grounds, and all profits went to Renaissance Entertainers Services and Crafters United (RESCU).

Performers
The Wyldewood Players, the oldest full-time professional acting troupe of any Renaissance Festival, comprise The Queen, her court, and the Warwick villagers (barber-surgeon, washer wenches, mud beggars, gravedigger, etc.).  Entertainments include The Queen's Tea, Her Majesty's Daily Diversion, Trial & Dunke, and a daily Publick Execution.  The Players' creative director Gary Izzo has more than 30 years' experience with interactive theatre, including with Disney theme parks, and is the author of The Art of Play: The New Genre of Interactive Theatre  (Heinemann Drama, 1997) and Acting Interactive Theatre: A Handbook (Pearson Education, 1998).
Other regular acts at the Fair include the following:

Patron participation
Many Fair attendees come in costume (""garb""), and booths inside the grounds offer garb for sale or rent.  Renaissance, fantasy, pirate, and steampunk are favorite themes.  In 2008, for the first time, peace-tied period weapons were permitted.
Sterling has an active group of long-time season ticket-holders known as ""Family of Faire"", many of whom have developed their own characters and attend every weekend of the season.

Ownership
The Festival was founded in 1976 by Dennis Ouellette Sr., and later owned and operated by Gerald and Virginia Young for more than thirty years.
In early 2008 the Fair was purchased by Doug Waterbury, who also owns an amusement park in Sylvan Beach and other entertainment venues in Central New York.  Waterbury invested $2 million in the business.  Several new stages were constructed and existing ones refurbished, and the number of performers was boosted for the 2008 season.  Waterbury planned to use the site for additional events, and install a larger jousting theater which could also be used for outdoor concerts.
Since taking ownership of the Festival, Doug Waterbury has been involved in a number of legal controversies, including refusals to provide legally-required safety inspections for the Festival as well as numerous sexual harassment allegations, arrests, and lawsuits.

In popular culture
Jamie Denbo, creator of Lifetime's American Princess, is a former Sterling cast member.

History
Early history
William A. Fickling, Sr., a local realtor, discovered the beauty of the Yoshino Cherry Trees in his own yard. At the time, he did not know the tree's species or that the species is not native to the South. During a trip to Washington, D.C. in 1952, he discovered a tree that looked identical to the ones growing in his yard. After comparing cut samples from each tree to those at the Tidal Basin, he discovered that they matched. Following this discovery, Fickling began to propagate the trees and give them away to those in the community. He became known as Macon's Johnny Appleseed.

A new resident to Macon, Carolyn Crayton, noticed the trees and thought they were beautiful. She approached Fickling at a picnic and spoke about planting more trees throughout Macon. To start the project, Fickling agreed to donate the trees if she would organize the planting.  On November 24, 1973, the first Yoshino cherry trees were planted. The community planted around 500 trees down Wesleyan Woods Drive and along Guerry Drive and Oxford Road. Over the years, the trees became a common sight around the city and grew to become an identifying symbol of the city.

The First Festival
Fickling donated about 30,000 trees by 1982. Crayton had the idea to celebrate Fickling and the trees he brought to the city. Her and The Keep Macon-Bibb Beautiful Commission worked to create the event. Macon celebrated its first International Cherry Blossom Festival that spring. The event lasted three days and was held at the Wesleyan College campus. Initially, it was meant to be a one time event, but it was so well received it became an annual celebration.

Today
There was no event in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic; the 39th was deferred to 2021.
The community continues to plant Yoshinos each year with the trees being donated by the Fickling Family Foundation after William Fickling's death.

Organization and Events
Organization
Festival organization is started months in advance of each festival. During this time, the Cherry Blossom board of directors and staff work on planning events, securing sponsors and working with the community to produce the festival. Volunteers from the community, like the Think Pink committee, also contribute to the festival through setting up and running events. In the approaching days of the festival, staff and volunteers make final preparations for the festival. Fountain water is dyed pink and cherry blossoms are painted around the area. The festival board also works together with Bibb County Sheriff's office to secure the festival as it is going on.

Events
Each year the Macon International Cherry Blossom Festival begins with a ribbon-cutting ceremony.
The festival often holds animal shows, concerts, theatrical performances, international showcase events, house tours, fashion shows, galas, luncheons, marathons, dances, fair rides, and bus tours along scenic Cherry Blossom trails. While some events vary each year, annual events include:

Pink Pancake Breakfast- The Macon-Bibb County Fire Department hosts the breakfast in Central City park. The event began in 1990 and serves as a fundraiser for the American Cancer Society.
Mulberry Street Festival - An outdoor fine arts and crafts show held on Mulberry Street in downtown Macon, featuring artists from around the nation.
International Food Fair - Held with the Mulberry Street Festival, it sells food from traditions around the world. Presented by Mellow Mushroom Macon.
Cherry Blossom Street Party - Bands and performers of rock, blues, country, and other genres play live music at night.
Cherry Blossom Pageant - A royal court of one queen and four princesses are chosen every year.
Air Show - Held every year at the Macon Downtown Airport, it features aerobatic performances by military airplanes.
Cherry Blossom Parade- Floats, marching bands, and performers ride around historic downtown Macon.
Ocmulgee Lantern Light Tour - A guided twilight walk through the trails of Ocmulgee National Monument.
Tunes and Balloons Festival Finale - Hot air balloons, live music, family activities, and fireworks close out the festival. It takes place on the Middle Georgia State University Macon campus.

International Reach
The festival has had visitors from all over the world. Officials and delegates from European countries such as Ireland and other countries including Taiwan, Russia, and Uganda have visited the festival and participated in parades in celebration of the theme ""love, beauty, and international friendship"". Jean-Patrick Courtois, mayor of Mâcon, France, visited the festival in 2013 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the two sister city's relationship.
Japan has a long history with the Macon Cherry Blossom Festival. At the first annual festival, representatives from Kurobe, Macon's sister city, visited the festival. After that year, Kurobe has sent gifts to the festival varying from lanterns to flowers every year since.

Economic impact
The Macon Cherry Blossom Festival is a 501(c)3 organization that is funded primarily by sponsors. However, the festival has a large impact on the economy of Macon. In 2018, it was estimated that there were over 100,000 visitors. About 30 percent of those visitors were said to be from out of town. The same year,  it was estimated that the festival alone brought in about $3 million. Visitors of the festival also spend money at hotels, shops, restaurants and other tourist attractions in the area, benefiting the local economy. Every year the overall economic impact of the festival ranges from $10 million to $12 million, according to a University of Georgia study.

Awards
The International Cherry Blossom Festival has been recognized by the International Festivals and Events Association. The festival has won Haas & Wilkerson Pinnacle awards in Gold, Silver and Bronze in a variety of categories. Awards were for the festival's promotion, programming, sponsorship, merchandise, media campaigns, and community outreach.

History
In 1888, nurserymen George Ellwanger and Patrick Barry endowed the Rochester community with 20 acres (81,000 m2) of gently rolling hills that are now known as Highland Park. It was noted as one of the nation's first municipal arboretums. Renowned park designer Frederick Law Olmsted was responsible for final development of Highland Park. The park's lilac collection was started by horticulturist John Dunbar in 1892 with 20 varieties, some of which were descendants of slips of native Balkan Mountain flowers that were carried to the new world by early colonists. Today, over 500 varieties of lilacs cover 22 of Highland Park's 155 acres (0.63 km2).
The inspiration for the festival dates to 1898 when 3,000 people came to the park one Sunday in May to see the lilacs. Ten years later, 25,000 people came to the first organized lilac festival. Since then the number of viewers has grown to over 500,000 and the festival is held over the course of ten days.
With the 2020 edition cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 123rd was deferred to 2021. The schedule was adjusted from the ten day format to three weekends in 2021 and 2022, and returned to its original format in 2023.

History
The Lompoc Valley Flower Festival was established in 1952, at first not as a flower festival but as an annual rodeo and parade. The original event grew until one of Lompoc's leading citizens at the time, George Miller, began championing for the Flower Festival.  Miller persuaded Lompoc's Chamber of Commerce to change from the rodeo and parade event, reasoning ""that while more than 200 California communities staged rodeos each year, large and small, Lompoc had its world famous flower fields, an asset that was unique and the perfect basis for the community event"".
The flower festival was developed around The Alpha Clubs Flower Show, which had previously been going since 1922. It started out as a 2-day event, but has grown over the years to a 5-day event. Nowadays, the biggest part of the festival is the parade.
The festival was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to effects of  the COVID-19 pandemic.

Parade
The Flower Festival Parade occurs annually on the Saturday morning of the festival.  It starts in downtown, travels through town, and concludes at the festival's site in Ryon Memorial Park, . The parade's route follows ""H"" Street and Ocean Avenue. Each float is required to be constructed of flowers and/or natural materials.

History of the cherry trees
Early initiatives
The effort to bring cherry blossom trees to Washington, D.C., preceded the official planting by several decades. In 1885, Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore returned from her first trip to Japan and approached the U.S. Army Superintendent of the Office of Public Buildings and Grounds with the idea of planting cherry trees along the reclaimed waterfront of the Potomac River. Scidmore, who would go on to become the first female board member of the National Geographic Society, was rebuffed, though she would continue proposing the idea to every Superintendent for the next 24 years. Several cherry trees were brought to the region by individuals in this period, including one that was the location of a 1905 cherry blossom viewing and tea party hosted by Scidmore in northwest D.C. Among the guests was prominent botanist David Fairchild and his fiancée Marian, the daughter of inventor Alexander Graham Bell.
In 1906, David Fairchild imported 1000 cherry trees from the Yokohama Nursery Company in Japan and planted them on his own property in Chevy Chase, Maryland.  The Fairchilds were pleased with the results of their planting and in 1907 began promoting Japanese flowering cherry trees as an ideal tree to plant around avenues in the Washington area. On September 26, with the help of the Fairchilds' friends, the Chevy Chase Land Company ordered 300 Oriental cherry trees for the Chevy Chase area. In 1908, Fairchild donated cherry saplings to every D.C. school to plant on its school grounds in observance of Arbor Day.  At an Arbor Day speech that Eliza Scidmore attended, Fairchild proposed that the ""Speedway"" (a now non-existing route around the D.C. Tidal Basin) be turned into a ""Field of Cherries"".
In 1909, Scidmore decided to raise the money to buy cherry trees and donate them to the District.  As a matter largely of form, on April 5 she wrote a letter to First Lady Helen Herron Taft, wife of newly elected President Taft, informing her of her plans.  Two days later, the First Lady responded:

Thank you very much for your suggestion about the cherry trees. I have taken the matter up and am promised the trees, but I thought perhaps it would be best to make an avenue of them, extending down to the turn in the road, as the other part is still too rough to do any planting. Of course, they could not reflect in the water, but the effect would be very lovely of the long avenue. Let me know what you think about this.
By chance, Jōkichi Takamine, the Japanese chemist who discovered adrenaline, was in Washington with Mr. Kokichi Midzuno, the Japanese consul to New York City, on April 8.  Informed of a plan to plant Japanese cherry trees along the Speedway (Ohio Avenue), Takamine asked if Mrs. Taft would accept an additional 2000 trees, while Midzuno suggested that the trees be given in the name of Tokyo.  Takamine and Midzuno subsequently met with the First Lady, who accepted the offer of 2000 trees.

On April 13, Spencer Cosby, Superintendent of the Office of Public Buildings and Grounds, purchased ninety cherry trees (Prunus serrulata) that were planted along the Potomac River from the Lincoln Memorial south toward East Potomac Park.  It was subsequently discovered that the trees were of the cultivar Shirofugen, rather than the ordered Fugenzo.  These trees had largely disappeared by the 21st century.
On August 30, 1909, the Embassy of Japan in Washington, D.C., informed the U.S. Department of State that the city of Tokyo intended to donate 2000 cherry trees to the United States to be planted along the Potomac. These trees arrived in Washington, D.C., on January 6, 1910. However, the inspection team from the Department of Agriculture (led by Flora Wambaugh Patterson) found that the trees were infested with insects and nematodes, concluding that the trees had to be destroyed to protect local growers. President Taft gave the order to burn the trees on January 28. Secretary of State Philander C. Knox wrote a letter expressing the regret of all involved to the Japanese Ambassador. Takamine responded to the news with another donation for more trees, 3020 in all, of a lineage taken from a famous group of trees along the Arakawa River in Tokyo and grafted onto stock from Itami, Hyogo Prefecture. On February 14, 1912, 3020 cherry trees of twelve cultivars were shipped on board the Awa Maru and arrived in D.C. via rail car from Seattle on March 26.
Much of the behind-the-scenes diplomatic events linked to the Japanese giving of the cherry blossom trees to Washington, D.C., in 1912 are relatively unknown, according to the March 26, 2010, Washington Post article ""Scenes from 2010's Cherry Blossom Festival, an annual rite of spring in Washington."" By Michael E. Ruane Washington Post Staff Writer. The Art of Peace illustrated biography on Prince Iyesato Tokugawa presents much of this prior history and the behind-the-scenes political details surrounding this Japanese goodwill gesture which point strongly to Prince Tokugawa's pivotal role in the initial Japanese gifting and its evolution into the National Cherry Blossom Festival in 1935. But instead of taking credit, Prince Tokugawa  humbly wished to have this gift be seen coming directly from Japan's capital city Tokyo to the U.S. capital city Washington, D.C., without himself getting any recognition for this international goodwill gesture. Prince Iyesato Tokugawa (1863–1940) held great influence based on his being both the heir to the last Shogun of Japan, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, a dynasty that ruled for over 260 years, and also based on Prince Tokugawa holding the powerful position of President of Japan's upper house of congress the House of Peers for thirty years (1903–1933).
The 1910 New York Daily Tribune announced the upcoming arrival of Prince Tokugawa to New York City, after he had just visited Washington, D.C. This article mentioned that scheduled to coincide with the visit of Prince Tokugawa to New York City, was the recent arrival of a delegation of sixty Japanese. Prince Tokugawa and this Japanese delegation had all spent time together in Washington, D.C., prior to their visiting New York City. While in Washington, D.C., Prince Tokugawa met and dined with President William Howard Taft at the White House, who was honoring his visit. To understand the comradery already established between Prince Tokugawa and President Taft, one needs to recognize that from 1901 to 1908, while serving under President Theodore Roosevelt, the then Secretary of War William Howard Taft traveled around the world, including voyages to Japan where he was hosted and met with Prince Tokugawa. Taft was being groomed for his future role as president.
While in Washington, D.C., during his 1910 visit, the 37-year-old Prince Tokugawa twice visited the U.S. Senate to see first-hand the American legislative process. Tokugawa wished to familiarize himself with the similarities and differences between various democracies, such as that of the United States and Britain, to that of his own nation, Japan. One of the Japanese delegates who was part of Prince Tokugawa's delegation, who is shown in the 1910 Daily Tribune newspaper article photo illustration was the Mayor of Tokyo Yukio Ozaki, the Japanese official most remembered being linked to the Japanese gift of cherry blossom trees. This 1910 news article also stated that as part of Prince Tokugawa's visit to New York City, Prince Tokugawa expressed his desire to see the immense development that had occurred in the United States since his last visit. Prince Tokugawa and five of his Japanese companions toured the city; this included a visit to the American Stock Exchange on Wall Street; they also marveled at the construction of the Holland Tunnel. Prince Tokugawa was also invited to a small private dinner in honor of his visit to New York City, given by Kokichi Midzuno, Consul General of Japan. (Midzuno is the Japanese official who first contacted Japan's central government in 1910, asking for their advice on how best to proceed with the Japanese gift of cherry trees to Washington, D.C.) Of the eighteen guests at the above dinner, several were prominent leaders from New York City's Japanese-American community. Rather than wishing to receive a recognition for facilitating the Japanese gifting of cherry trees, Prince Iyesato Tokugawa preferred that the gift be seen as a token of goodwill coming directly from Japan and its capital city of Tokyo to the United States and its capital city of Washington, D.C. During his visit to the U.S., Tokugawa introduced the mayor of Tokyo to many influential Japanese Americans and to U.S. officials, so as to promote this Japanese gift, which in coming decades would be commemorated and grow into one of Washington, D.C.'s largest celebrations.
During his long career, Prince Tokugawa creatively promoted a friendship and alliance with six U.S. presidents and other world leaders during his extensive travels abroad. He was in many ways the diplomatic face of Japan when it came to international relations during the first 40 years of the twentieth century. Those years were often politically and socially turbulent, requiring Prince Tokugawa to take a leading role in encouraging respectful international diplomacy and military arms limitation at the Washington Naval Arms Conference. He strongly promoted an appreciation for democracy and during the 1920s took a leading stance against racism by introducing Abraham Lincoln's principles of equality into all of Japan's public schools and universities through Lincoln essay writing contests, where the winning students were given bronze commemorative coins with the face of President Lincoln.
One of Prince Tokugawa's closest and most influential Japanese allies was Baron Shibusawa Eiichi (aka Baron Eiichi Shibusawa). The combination of the 1915 and 1937 illustrations to the right offer a new window to Prince Tokugawa and Baron Shibusawa and their allies' significant influence linked to the initial cherry blossom tree giving and its evolution into the annual National Cherry Blossom Festival. The 1915 illustration is a rare photo that was discovered while doing research for the illustrated biography The Art of Peace. This biography highlights the alliance of Prince Tokugawa and Baron Shibusawa as they strove to promote international goodwill. This 1915 photo illustration (which is a section of a larger photograph) presents Baron Shibusawa Eiichi standing between two of his prominent Japanese colleagues. Shibusawa had been sitting at the other end of the huge banquet table, near former President Theodore Roosevelt, but for the sake of shooting and capturing this group photo of sixty attendees, the photographer requested that Shibusawa come to the other side of the table to be closer to former President William Howard Taft (who is at the far right in the photo, seated next to the gentleman whose image reveals only one half of his face). Standing at Shibusawa's right side is the Japanese-American Jōkichi Takamine, one of the two individuals who hosted this diplomatic banquet event. Takamine was a highly successful and respected chemist and businessman who helped found an international pharmaceutical company that continues to this day. Takamine was the individual who first offered to pay for the cherry blossom trees that were to be given by Japan to Washington, D.C. In this 1915 photo, standing at Shibusawa's left side is Count Chinda Sutemi, Japanese Ambassador to the United States. Both Takamine and Ambassador Sutemi were closely linked to the giving of cherry blossom trees to Washington, D.C.

Japanese gift planted
In a ceremony on March 27, 1912, First Lady Helen Herron Taft and Viscountess Chinda, wife of the Japanese ambassador, planted the first two of these trees on the north bank of the Tidal Basin in West Potomac Park. At the end of the ceremony, the First Lady presented Viscountess Chinda with a bouquet of 'American Beauty' roses. These two trees still stand at the terminus of 17th Street Southwest, marked by a large plaque. By 1915, the United States government had responded with a gift of flowering dogwood trees to the people of Japan.

To further build on the growing goodwill between Japan and the U.S. based on the giving of the Cherry Blossom Trees in 1912, one of Prince Iyesato Tokugawa's close friends and political allies, Baron Eiichi Shibusawa, visited the U.S. in 1915. The 1915 photo illustration presented to the right presents Shibusawa attending a large banquet in New York City that was held in his honor. The host of this banquet is Jōkichi Takamine, the successful Japanese-American community activist and businessman who first offered to purchase the cherry blossom trees and have this gift diplomatically come from the nation of Japan. Former President William Howard Taft is also in attendance at this event showing respect for Baron Shibusawa. It was President Taft and his wife who officially received the gift of the cherry blossom trees from the representatives of Japan three years earlier.
From 1913 to 1920, trees of the Somei-Yoshino variety, which comprised 1800 of the gift, were planted around the Tidal Basin. Trees of the other 11 cultivars, and the remaining Yoshinos, were planted in East Potomac Park. In 1927, a group of American school children re-enacted the initial planting. This event is recognized as the first D.C. cherry blossom festival. In 1934, the District of Columbia Commissioners sponsored a three-day celebration of the flowering cherry trees.

National annual event
The first ""Cherry Blossom Festival"" was held in late 1934 under joint sponsorship by numerous civic groups, and in 1935 it officially became a national annual event. The cherry trees had by this point become an established part of the nation's capital. In 1938, plans to cut down trees to clear ground for the Jefferson Memorial prompted a group of women to chain themselves together at the site in protest. A compromise was reached where more trees would be planted along the south side of the Basin to frame the Memorial. A Cherry Blossom Pageant was begun in 1940.
In 1937, the Garden Club of America commemorated the 25th Anniversary of the Japanese gift of cherry blossom trees to the U.S., by giving 5,000 flowering trees and plants to Japan. Who better to receive this U.S. goodwill gift than Prince Tokugawa, who had played a pivotal role behind-the-scenes and had introduced the then Mayor of Tokyo Ozaki to the U.S. leaders in Washington, D.C., in 1910, as part of the giving of those cherry blossom trees. It is revealing that in 1937, Prince Tokugawa accompanied by the current mayor of Tokyo are now the representatives of Japan in receiving this gift from the Garden Club of America at a ceremony held at Kiyozumi Park, Tokyo.

On December 11, 1941, four trees were cut down. It is suspected that this was retaliation for the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan four days earlier, though this was never confirmed. In hopes of dissuading people from further attacks upon the trees during the war, they were referred to as ""Oriental"" flowering cherry trees for the war's duration.  Suspended during World War II, the festival resumed in 1947 with the support of the Washington, D.C., Board of Trade and the D.C. Commissioners.
In 1948, the Cherry Blossom Princess and U.S. Cherry Blossom Queen program were started by the National Conference of State Societies. A Princess was selected from each state and federal territory, with a queen chosen to reign over the festival. In 1952, Japan requested help restoring the cherry tree grove at Adachi, Tokyo, along the Arakawa River, which was the parent stock of the D.C. trees but had diminished during the war. In response, the National Park Service sent budwood back to Tokyo.

In 1954, the governor of Tokyo gifted the Japanese Lantern, a 300-year-old granite lantern, to the city of Washington to commemorate the signing of the 1854 Japan-US Treaty of Amity and Friendship by Commodore Matthew C. Perry. The lantern was originally carved in 1651 as one of two memorializing Tokugawa Iemitsu and was brought to West Potomac Park from Ueno Park in Taitō, Tokyo, where the other lantern remains. For over 50 years, the lighting of the lantern by the Embassy of Japan's appointed Cherry Blossom Princess has opened the Festival.
Three years later, the president of The Pearl Company started by Mikimoto Kōkichi donated the Mikimoto Pearl Crown. Containing more than 2 lb (1 kg) of gold and 1,585 pearls, the crown is used at the coronation of the Festival Queen at the Grand Ball. The next year, the mayor of Yokohama gave a stone pagoda to the city to ""symbolize the spirit of friendship between the United States of America manifested in the Treaty of Peace, Amity and Commerce signed at Yokohama on March 31, 1854.""
The Japanese gave 3,800 more Yoshino trees in 1965, which were accepted by First Lady Lady Bird Johnson. These trees were grown in the United States and many were planted on the grounds of the Washington Monument. For the occasion, the First Lady and Ryuji Takeuchi, wife of the Japanese ambassador, reenacted the 1912 planting. In 1982, Japanese horticulturalists took cuttings from Yoshino trees in Washington, D.C., to replace cherry trees that had been destroyed in a flood in Japan. From 1986 to 1988, 676 cherry trees were planted using US$101,000 in private funds donated to the National Park Service to restore the trees to the number at the time of the original gift.
In 1994, the Festival was expanded to two weeks to accommodate the many activities that happen during the trees' blooming. Two years later, the Potomac and Arakawa became sister rivers. Cuttings were taken from the documented 1912 trees in 1997 to be used in replacement plantings and thus preserve the genetic heritage of the grove. In 1999, fifty trees of the Usuzumi variety from Motosu, Gifu, were planted in West Potomac Park. According to legend, these trees were first planted by Emperor Keitai in the 6th century and were designated a National Treasure of Japan in 1922. From 2002 to 2006, 400 trees propagated from the surviving 1912 trees were planted to ensure the genetic heritage of the original donation is maintained.

Organization and events
The National Cherry Blossom Festival is coordinated by the National Cherry Blossom Festival, Inc., a 501(c)(3) organization consisting of representatives of business, civic, and governmental organizations. More than 700,000 people visit Washington each year to admire the blossoming cherry trees that herald the beginning of spring in the nation's capital.
The three-week festival begins around the middle of March with a Family Day at the National Building Museum and an official opening ceremony in the Warner Theatre. The Pink Tie Party is also held, at which attendees are invited to don their finest pink attire to revel together and toast the spring season. An array of activities and cultural events takes place on the following days. The Blossom Kite Festival (formerly the Smithsonian Kite Festival) usually takes place during the festival's first or second weekend. Every day there is a sushi/sake celebration, classes about cherry blossoms, and a bike tour of the Tidal Basin. Other events include art exhibits (photography, sculpture, animation), cultural performances, rakugo, kimono fashion shows, dance, singing, martial arts, merchant-sponsored events, and a rugby union tournament.
The next Saturday, a three-stage festival takes place on the Southwest Waterfront. When the festival ends, a fireworks show begins on the nearby Washington Channel. The next morning (Sunday), the Credit Union Cherry Blossom Ten Mile Run begins on the grounds of the Washington Monument. Later that Sunday, dignitaries gather at the Tidal Basin to participate in a ceremonial lighting of the 360-year-old Japanese stone lantern.
During the morning of the festival's last Saturday, the National Cherry Blossom Festival Parade travels along Constitution Avenue from 7th to 17th Streets, NW. For 16 years until 2015, the Sakura Matsuri-Japanese Street Festival (Japanese: さくらまつり), the largest Japanese Cultural Festival in the United States, took place throughout the day along 12th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, near the route of the parade.  However, the 2016 Street Festival will take place at M Street SE and New Jersey Avenue SE, near the Department of Transportation exit of the Navy Yard-Ballpark Metro station in the distant Capitol Riverfront area. The Street Festival's relocation became necessary when the Trump Organization, which operates the Trump International Hotel in the Old Post Office Pavilion at 12th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW, negotiated a deal with the Government of the District of Columbia that requires a 20 feet (6 m)-wide lane on Pennsylvania Avenue to remain open to the hotel's customers and valet parking service except during major events such as presidential inaugural parades, thus leaving insufficient space on the Avenue for the festival's activities.
In 2009, the National Cherry Blossom Festival introduced an alternative event to its lineup, with the debut of Cherry Blast, a mix of art, dance performances, live music, and fashion that took place in an Anacostia warehouse. In 2010, Cherry Blast II—the creation of artist Philippa P. Hughes of the Pink Line Project—moved to a storage warehouse in Adams Morgan, but still featured an eclectic group of local artists and musicians. The 2016 Cherry Blast took place at the Carnegie Library at Mount Vernon Square during the last Saturday evening of the festival.
The event's organizers cancelled many of the events since 2020 because of concerns related the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Several activities have since been added to engage the community in the springtime celebration, such as Petal Porches, Art in Bloom, and Paws & Petals.

Types of cherry trees
Of the initial gift of 12 varieties of 3,020 trees, The Yoshino Cherry (70% of total) and Kwanzan Cherry (13% of total) now dominate.
The first 12 cultivars presented were 'Yoshino', 'Kwanzan', 'Ichiyo', 'Taki-nioi', 'Shirayuki', 'Fugenzo', 'Ariake', 'Jo-nioi', 'Fukurokuju', 'Surugadai-nioi', 'Gyoiko', and 'Mikuruma-gaeshi'. With the exception of 'Yoshino', these 11 cultivars belong to the Sato-zakura group, a complex interspecific hybrid derived from the Oshima cherry. Many cultivars other than 'Yoshino' and 'Kwanzan' are not currently available for viewing because the government didn't obtained them after the original trees reached their maximum age.
The Yoshino produces single white blossoms that create an effect of white clouds around the Tidal Basin and north onto the grounds of the Washington Monument. Intermingled with the Yoshino are a small number of Akebono cherry trees, which bloom at the same time as the Yoshino and produce single, pale-pink blossoms.
The Kwanzan grows primarily in East Potomac Park and comes into bloom two weeks after the Yoshino. It produces clusters of clear pink double blossoms. East Potomac Park also has Fugenzo, which produces rosy pink double blossoms, and Shirofugen, which produces white double blossoms that age to pink.
Interspersed among all the trees are the Weeping Cherry, which produces a variety of single and double blossoms of colors ranging from dark pink to white about a week before the Yoshino. Other cultivars and species that can be found are the Autumn Cherry (semi-double, pink), Sargent Cherry (single, deep pink), Usuzumi (white-grey), and Takesimensis (good in wet areas).

Competitors
The amateur division of the show known as the Competitive Classes often have an assigned theme, related to the overall show theme.  The 2007 Show, Legends of Ireland, featured Pressed Plant Material (i.e. dried flower pictures) that ""incorporated a Celtic Knot.""  The first weekend's Medium Niche theme was Wish You Were Here ""Exhibitors will be sent Irish postcards for inspiration.  A copy of the postcard will be mounted next to the exhibit."" Entrants for that class typically have a mockup of the niche at home, where they practice assembling and lighting their entry in the months preceding the show.  In a Challenge class, entrants bring only pruning shears, and must use show-provided materials to interpret a theme within a limited amount of time.  Three typical Horticulture classes are 142: Clivia, flowering. Pot 8"" or under, 143: Clivia, flowering. Pot 8""-10"", and 144: Clivia, foliage.  (There was also a Clivia entered in 2007 under Exceptional plants 10–20 years old, to be judged against “perfection” for their species/cultivar.)

Seth Pearsoll, PHS director of design, stated the desired type of Flower Show participants:We want designers who are firmly rooted in horticulture and great plant design, but who also are thinking about culture at large and how these designs relate to those issues. We want guests to be moved and delighted and to be changed, in some small way, by these gardens and the ideas behind them.

History
The international nonprofit organization Pennsylvania Horticultural Society was founded in 1827. The site claims the PHS ""uses horticulture to advance the health and well-being of the Greater Philadelphia region,"" and that their programs ""create healthier living environments, increase access to fresh food, expand access to jobs and economic opportunity, and strengthen deeper social connections between people.""
In 1829, the first Philadelphia Flower Show was held in a Freemason building.^ The one-day exhibition showcased fruit, flowers, and plants. This included the poinsettia, a plant then-newly imported from Mexico, which was exhibited by Colonel Robert Carr. The Encyclopedia of American Folklife credits the flower show with introducing poinsettias as an American Christmas tradition, as the festival introduced the plant to hundreds of Americans.
There were no shows in 1917–18 nor 1942–45.
In 1925, the PHS joined the Florist Club, an association of local florist businesses. The 1925 show attracted 84,000 people. In 1927, Philadelphia Flower Show, Inc. was established; it assumed management of the Flower Show until the mid-1960s.
In 1964, Philadelphia Flower Show Inc. halted production of the show due to difficulty finding a suitable exhibition location. The show returned in 1966, moving to the now-demolished Philadelphia Civic Center, where it remained each year until 1996, when it moved to its present location at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. Today, PHS contributes to the local economy and the green life of Philadelphia and the region. Proceeds from the Flower Show support thousands of revitalization projects in communities. In recent years, a youth division was added to the pressed flower category, with the most recent winner being Kendall Wolson, a 17-year-old student from New Jersey who created a scene depicting two bears catching fish in a river.
In 1981, total attendance was 230,000; 210,000 were guests who had paid admission, and the rest were exhibitors, judges, PHS members, and the press.
The 2020 theme was ""Riviera Holiday.""
In 2021, the Philadelphia Flower Show was held outdoors at Franklin Delano Roosevelt Park in June instead of its usual location at the Pennsylvania Convention Center due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was the first time the Philadelphia Flower Show was held outdoors. The 2022 show was also held at FDR Park. In 2023, the Philadelphia Flower Show will return to the Pennsylvania Convention Center and will be held in March.

Dates and themes
Previous dates extend to 1829, but PHS did not record their dates and themes in the above listing. 
Historical art and photographs from 1829 to present relating to the PHS's Flower Show can be found on the Digital Archives of Pennsylvania Department of Education.

It is organized by the volunteer non-profit Portland Rose Festival Foundation (named the Portland Rose Festival Association until the 2000s) with the purpose of promoting the Portland region.  It includes three separate parades, along with a number of other activities.

History
The Portland Rose Society, founded by Georgiana Pittock and friends in 1888, began with a backyard rose show in Pittock's garden. The annual fundraising event drew more crowds each year. By 1904, the rose society was hosting its annual rose show along with additional festivities, including a parade and pageant.  In 1905, Portland Mayor Harry Lane is remembered for his rousing speech at the Lewis and Clark Exposition, telling the large crowd that Portland needed a ""festival of roses"". In 1906, the first Rose Festival and Flower Parade was held in Portland. Pittock and neighbors contributed roses from their gardens to decorate floats, wagons, people and horses for the parade. In 1907, the Portland Rose Festival Association was incorporated and Portland hosted its first official Portland Rose Festival.
The Grand Floral Parade is the centerpiece of the festival and the second largest all-floral parade in the United States after the Tournament of Roses Parade. More than 500,000 spectators line the route, making this flower parade the largest single-day spectator event in Oregon. The first parade, in 1907, was called the Rose Carnival, but eventually came to be known as the Rose Festival Parade and later still the Grand Floral Parade.  The 1907 festival also included an ""electric parade"" with illuminated floats; this evolved into the Merrykhana Parade but after a two-season suspension was renamed the Starlight Parade in 1976.
Since 1930 a queen has been selected from a court of high school seniors from each school in the area. The members of the court are called princesses. For a brief period starting in 1997 they were officially called ""ambassadors"", but the term ""princesses"" was reinstated in January 2007. A college scholarship is awarded to a 14-member ""royalty"". Starting in 2009, the Rose Festival Foundation opened one place on the court to someone from a school outside the Portland city limits.
There are drivers for the Princesses, who are chosen from each high school. The first African American driver (escort) was Sam Whitney from Benson High School in 1954. 
A Junior Rose Festival, focused on children, began unofficially in 1921, on the city's east side, and included its own parade and junior court. It became an official part of the Rose Festival in 1936.  The festival's annual Junior Parade takes place in the city's Hollywood district.  The Junior Parade has grown to an event involving nearly 10,000 children, making it the world's largest parade for children.

During Fleet Week, ships from United States Navy, Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers and the Royal Canadian Navy dock along the seawall of Tom McCall Waterfront Park.
The festival also hosts the Starlight Parade, a fireworks display, and carnival rides along the Portland waterfront, among other events.  Dragon boat races on the Willamette River have been included every year since 1989.
The Golden Rose Ski Classic is an annual ski race originating in 1936.  It is the oldest known organized ski race in America, and is the only USSA-sanctioned summer race.
An air show was added to the Rose Festival in 1988 and remained part of the festival through 2002.  Held at the Hillsboro Airport, it was named the Rose Festival Air Show, with the name generally preceded by a sponsor's name, but after the 2002 and 15th show the Rose Festival Association decided to discontinue its relationship with the event. In 2003, the show was reorganized as the Oregon International Air Show, with different sponsors and no longer a Rose Festival event.
No festival was held in 1917 and 1918 because of World War I or from 1942 through 1945 because of World War II. From 2007 to 2016, the festival began with the 82nd Avenue of Roses Parade. The parade was cancelled in 2017, but returned in 2018. COVID-19 pandemic concerns canceled the 2020 and 2021 parades, but the parade would return in 2022.

History
Early Hempfests ""featured blatant marijuana smoking""; 60 people were cited for illegal marijuana use at the 1997 Hempfest, and about 20 were arrested the following year. Eventually Hempfest and the police reached a modus vivendi: there was only one arrest in 2001. About this time, the director was Dominic Holden, who was also campaign manager of an organization trying to make cannabis the city of Seattle's lowest law enforcement priority through a voter initiative, I-75. The political context surrounding marijuana in Seattle and Washington has changed considerably over the years. Washington legalized medical marijuana in 1998. In 2003, Seattle passed I-75.
The 2008 Seattle Hempfest, which took place August 16–17, set a new record for attendance, topping 310,000 people.  The volunteers of Seattle Hempfest were awarded the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) award for ""Outstanding Cannabis Advocate of the Year Award"" on October 17, 2008 at the National NORML Conference for their efforts.
2011 Hempfest speakers included numerous elected officials, among them Ohio congressman Dennis Kucinich, Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn, City Attorney Pete Holmes, a return by Councilman Licata, and Washington State Representatives Mary Lou Dickerson and Roger Goodman.
2013 saw the legalization of cannabis use in Washington state; that year's Seattle Hempfest featured performances by Everlast, Hed PE and DJ Muggs of Cypress Hill. As of 2013, the festival had an annual budget of approximately $700,000.
The 2015 Hempfest named David Bronner, CEO of Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps, the Cannabis Activist of the Year.
The 2020 Hempfest was the most recent event, with the organizers stating they are planning to return in 2024.

First held in 1924, it is one of the oldest civic celebrations in the Commonwealth of Virginia.

History
The festival was first held Saturday, May 3, 1924, and was originally celebrated as a one-day event (although not held in 1942–1945 due to World War II). Features include a Grand Feature Parade, Firefighters' Parade (first held on Thursday, April 18, 1929), a carnival and midway, luncheons, races, walks, dances and concerts, as well as a field show competition which formerly gave out the Queen's Cup trophy to the winner (although the trophy was retired in 1977, by Princess Anne High School of Virginia Beach, Virginia after winning the competition three straight years). The Queen, Queen Shenandoah, has been crowned every year at John Handley High School (with the exception of 2007, due to ongoing renovations), starting with the original Queen, Elizabeth Steck (Arthur).
A loss of interest during the 1930s, prompted the appointment of Tom Baldridge to the seat of Executive Director of the festival. He was also employed at MGM in the publicity department, which allowed him the opportunity to schedule celebrities, in turn renewing public interest in the festival. The period of the 1960s and 1970s introduced various new aspects to the festival including: the first visit by a U.S. President, Lyndon B. Johnson (1964), the beginning of attendance by sports celebrities Jack Dempsey (1965), and the premier of Sunday in the Park (1975). The Cole Brothers Circus of the Stars, still a favorite of children, first appeared at the festival in 1981.

The festival today
The festival is run by the private Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival organization and attracts over 250,000 people. Highlights include the Old Town Wine & Fine Arts Festival and the Apple Blossom Carnival.
The festival is known for its many guest celebrities and events. During the spring, in preparation for the festival, the citizens of Winchester hold an annual clean-up, followed by decoration of the city in green, pink and white (festival colors), in order to make Winchester more presentable for its anticipated guests.
On March 17, 2020 it was announced that planning for the 2020 festival was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, effectively cancelling the event for that year.
The festival was held in 2021 with the theme “Back in Bloom.” Offering 21 events, this 2021 festival was condensed when compared with earlier instances of the festival, which generally presented more than twice that number of events. Restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic were in place for the 2021 festival, such as the requirement that a maximum of 900 people attend the Apple Blossom Carnival at any one time.

The festivities, taking place during the third weekend of October, draw thousands of tourists to the city each year.

History
The first Tyler Rose Festival was organized by Tyler Garden Club members, local rose growers and the Chamber of Commerce in October 1933 for the purpose of focusing attention on the importance of the rose industry to Tyler, and to showcase the town's elegance; it was renamed the Texas Rose Festival during the Texas Centennial in 1936. Aside from the festival's suspension during World War II & in 2020, it has been an annual event.

The Rose Queen and her court
Many of the festival's events center on the Rose Queen and her court, who wear lavish gowns and costumes that are often in keeping with the theme of the year's festival. These participants generally come from wealthy backgrounds  and often have long family histories with the festival; many have played various roles in the events since childhood. The queen and her court are chosen by the President of the Texas Rose Festival Association who works in the organization for 4 years before taking on the role as president.
In addition to the Rose Queen, the court includes:

The Duchess of the Rose Growers, a member of a rose-growing family selected by and representing the Texas Rose Growers Association.
Out-of-town duchesses and escorts, sponsored by a family involved in the Rose Festival and invited because of relationships with Tyler residents.
 Ladies in waiting, a select group of young women from Tyler, in their sophomore year of college, whose families have been involved in the festival for several years.
Train bearers, scepter bearers and attendants to the queen, usually elementary-school-aged children whose families are involved in the festival.

There are also many other events such as an art show; a car show; doll, bear and toy shows; an arts and crafts fair; and symphony concerts in the park.
The Rose Parade is easily the biggest part of the Rose Festival. This parade takes place on the Saturday morning of the festival, and starts on Fifth St. and travels down Erwin to the Rose Stadium where it ends.  It is free to watch the parade on the streets, but you must buy a ticket to be admitted into the shaded side of the stadium. People all over come and line up on the streets of Tyler to see the girls in their magnificent dresses and cheer them on. The girls participating in the festival ride on floats depending on their presentation party, with the Queen and her court riding on the last few floats. The Queen gets her own float. When the floats get to the stadium, they go along the track for one last viewing, and then end.
A number of private parties also coincide with the festival, including the Queen's Coronation Ball hosted by the Order of the Rose. On the last night of the festival, the families and friends of the girls participating sit and watch each girl get presented. The girls who are from Tyler, Texas wear white ball gowns, while the girls from out of the city wear jewel colored gowns. The Queen is the last to be presented, and after all the girls are done there is a party with music and dancing.

The Canadian Tulip Festival, which claims to be the world's largest tulip festival, is a major event held annually each May in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. During World War II, the Dutch royal family took refuge in Canada.

History
The Washington State Apple Blossom Festival, originally called ""Blossom Days"", was founded in 1919 to celebrate the importance of the apple industry to the region. The Ladies Musical Club produced the first festival in 1920, a one-day event in Memorial Park involving songs, speeches, maypoles, and baseball. The festival's relative success in drawing in large crowds from the area assured the continuation of the festival in subsequent years. In 1921, the Commercial Club, forerunner of the Wenatchee Valley Chamber of Commerce, took over sponsorship of the celebration.
When the festival began again after World War II, the festival was renamed the Washington State Apple Blossom Festival to more accurately reflect the importance of the apple industry in North Central Washington.
In 1967, Wenatchee established a sister city relationship with the Aomori Apple Blossom Festival in Japan.
On what would've been the centennial anniversary in 2020, officials cite the COVID-19 pandemic as grounds for cancellation. The next year saw the festival defer to early June. 
There were other cancellations from 1942 to 1945.

History
In the early 1960s, Jim Erickson, the owner of an orchard in Bayfield, was traveling to North Dakota to deliver a shipment of apples. While in Duluth, his truck had a flat tire. While waiting for a spare to be driven up from home, many people stopped to ask about buying his fruit. After selling bushels of apples to 25 people, he started wondering why he (and other Bayfield apple growers) were traveling so far to sell their goods. Realizing an opportunity, a discussion was raised about selling the local orchard's products more locally, and the idea of Applefest was born. The attendance of the first event in 1962 was 5,000. Over they years, Applefest has continued to experience huge growth in attendance.
No Applefest was planned in 2020 as officials cited the COVID-19 pandemic as cause for cancellation. The 59th was deferred to 2021, when it resumes.

There are many variations, but the classic banana split is made with three scoops of ice cream (one each of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry). A sauce or sauces (chocolate, strawberry, and pineapple are traditional) are drizzled onto the ice cream, which is topped with whipped cream and maraschino cherries.

A sauce or sauces (chocolate, strawberry, and pineapple are traditional) are drizzled onto the ice cream, which is topped with whipped cream and maraschino cherries. Crushed nuts (generally peanuts or walnuts) are optional.

Description
The original banana split was made with three scoops of different flavored ice creams, topped with fruits, and served over a banana that was split vertically down the middle. The original recipe used strawberries, raspberries and crushed pineapple with marshmallow syrup, chopped nuts, and pitted black cherries. The banana split is traditionally served in an elongated glass dish called a ""boat"".
Strickler's marshmallow sauce is no longer used as a topping. The traditional toppings used in today's banana split include pineapple, strawberry and chocolate sauce, whipped cream, nuts, and cherries. Caramel sauce, on the other hand, is a non-traditional topping used in later variations of the classic banana split.
Variations on the classic may use grilled bananas, experiment with different flavors of ice cream such as coconut or coffee, or sauces like salted caramel and warm butterscotch.

History
Cold beverages and ice cream were a novelty in the mid-1800s when soda fountains began selling ice cream concoctions. A popular recipe published in 1907 called for a lengthwise split banana, two scoops of ice cream at each end and a spoon of whipped cream in between with maraschino cherries on top, with one end covered with chopped mixed nuts and another with chopped mixed fruits. The Spatula Soda Water Guide published in 1919 contained recipes for 25 banana split varieties. 
The origin of the banana split is disputed, but most historians believe it was first created in 1904 by an optometrist in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, named David ""Doc"" Strickler. Strickler was inspired by the fruit laden sundaes he saw while vacationing in Atlantic City in the summer of 1904, and aspired to create something similar when he returned to Latrobe using the banana fruit, which, in those days, was shipped to Pennsylvania by way of New Orleans. The sundae he concocted originally cost 10 cents, twice the price of other sundaes, and caught on with students of nearby Saint Vincent College. News of a new variety of sundae quickly spread by word-of-mouth and through correspondence and soon progressed far beyond Latrobe. Strickler went on to buy the pharmacy, naming it Strickler's Pharmacy, while keeping his office on a top floor. 
Wilmington, Ohio, also claims an early connection dating to 1907 when Ernest ""Doc"" Hazard created a dessert in hopes of attracting students from Wilmington College to his shop during the slow days of winter. The dessert he came up with was the banana split: three scoops of ice cream served between the two halves of a split banana, topped with chocolate, strawberry and pineapple sauces, whipped cream, maraschino cherries and nuts. 
However, most historians believe the evidence for Strickler's 1904 debut is more convincing, and, in 2004, the National Ice Cream Retailers Association (NICRA) certified the city of Latrobe, Pennsylvania, as the birthplace of the banana split. Both towns hold an annual festival in honor of the dessert. 

Latrobe and Wilmington are not the only towns to claim the distinction of inventing the banana split. In Boston it is said the dessert was created at the Butler Department Store by the head soda jerk who, in 1905, served a banana split with two scoops of vanilla ice cream, topped with peaches, walnuts and pistachios. Davenport, Iowa, claims it was invented by a local Davenport confectioner in 1906, and similar claims have been made by Columbus, Ohio, where the banana split is said to have been created by Letty Lally when a customer at Foeller's Drug Store asked for ""something different."" (Food writer Mike Turback considers Lally's creation the first banana royale, a sundae made with banana slices.) The lack of evidence presents an obstacle to proving any of these claims.
Walgreens is credited with spreading the popularity of the banana split. The early drug stores operated by Charles Rudolph Walgreen in the Chicago area adopted the banana split as a signature dessert. Fountains in the stores proved to be a draw, attracting customers who might otherwise have been just as satisfied having their prescriptions filled at some other drug store in the neighborhood.

Banana split pie
The banana split pie was created by Janet Winquest, a 16-year-old resident of Holdrege, Nebraska. In 1952, she won a $3,000 prize in Pillsbury's Grand National Recipe and Baking Contest for the recipe.

In popular culture
Louis Prima played a song called ""Banana Split for My Baby"" at the Casbar Lounge of the Sahara Hotel in 1956.
The banana split is reputed to have inspired the longstanding debate between residents of the counties of Devon and Cornwall in England about how to correctly assemble a traditional cream tea. With food rationing imposed after WW2, ice cream was in short supply, so the split's usual ingredients were partly replaced by scones made with locally grown ingredients. Local traditions developed quickly within each county about how best to meet the tastes of their respective tourist trade, leading to differing applications of the cream in the assembly of the dish. This situation was famously satirised in a BBC 1970s mockumentary Bunfight at the O.K. Tea Rooms. This divergence continues into the modern day.

The King Pumpkin contenders are too heavy to be weighed on a conventional scale, weighing in at over 650 kg (1400 lbs), and thus a local funeral home scale is used. The official ribbon cutting is held the following day and is done by either the committee president, city mayor, parade marshal or other notable local figure. The Annual Pumpkin Auction is held on the last day, Sunday, where the local business compete bids to display the winning pumpkin and sell off the seeds as they see fit.

Considered to be the biggest festival in the United States dedicated to the pumpkin, it is billed as The Greatest Free Show On Earth. Attendance has topped 400,000 for the four-day event, which is free to enter.

Dates
The Pumpkin Show begins on the third Wednesday of October and lasts until the following Saturday. In recent years, a Tuesday preview night ""for locals"" has been introduced, adding an unofficial half day to the event.

Locations
Starting on the Sunday before the festival, work begins to restrict traffic in downtown Circleville. The restricted areas dedicated to the show are from South Scioto Street on the west to Pickaway Street on the east, and Watt/Pinckney Street on the north to Franklin Street on the south. More than 12 blocks are restricted by this event, which causes massive detours throughout a major portion of the city, including State Route 56 and U.S. Route 22. Because there is no organized parking system, many small businesses, individuals, and non-profit organizations provide parking for varying fees.

History
In October 1903, Mayor George R. Haswell decided to hold a small pumpkin-and-corn exhibit in front of his store to celebrate the local harvest. This small exhibit featured corn, carved pumpkins and other harvest-themed displays. Because of the prominence of pumpkins in this first exhibit, the name ""The Pumpkin Show"" was then coined. In the following years local merchants were attracted to improve the size, scope and attendance of the festival. By 1905, the first ride was installed. Soon after, with the success of the shows, an annual festival was organized to be held on the city streets to attract merchants, patrons and improve the quality of the festival.
The Pumpkin Show has been held annually since 1903. Despite it still being held during the influenza outbreaks of 1918–1919, the Pumpkin Show was stopped for one year during World War I, two years during World War II, and in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Pumpkin Show became the sixth-largest festival in the United States by 2007, attracting more than 300,000 people to the city every year.

Traditions
Every Pumpkin Show officially kicks off with the weigh-in of large pumpkins from around the area. The largest pumpkin to date was grown by Bob & Jo Liggett, with their entry from 2023 weighing in at 2,388.5 pounds (1,083.4 kg). It is the current Ohio state record holder. Recent weigh-ins have had multiple entries that go over 1,000 pounds (450 kg).
Every year, Lindsey's Bakery creates the ""world's largest"" pumpkin pie. Visitors can be in line for over an hour to see the pie. At the 100th anniversary Pumpkin Show in 2006, the bakery had to make a much bigger pie compared to previous years to officially reclaim the title of world's largest. The pie pan was so large that it was moved outside of the bakery window and into a tent out on the street.
Another long-standing tradition of the Circleville Pumpkin Show is a pageant to crown the Little Miss and Miss Pumpkin Show Queen. The Little Miss Pumpkin Show Queen must be in the 2nd grade at a school in Pickaway County, while the Miss Pumpkin Show Queen must be a junior from one of the six local high schools. Once crowned, they lead off each parade for the rest of the event.
Seven parades in total are held during the event (two on Wednesday-Friday, one night parade on Saturday). These parades have many different themes, including the Pet Parade and Baby Parade. These parades also feature performances by many local high school and middle school bands, as well as other organizations. The Ohio University Marching 110, which is often referred to as ""The Most Exciting Band In The Land,"" has made numerous trips to highlight Thursday night's parade of bands. The 2006 Pumpkin Show welcomed The Ohio State University Marching Band. They came back in 2010 to march in the parade of bands again and hold a concert afterwards.

Facts
The Pumpkin Show features several different pumpkin related foods, including pumpkin donuts, pancakes, burgers, ice cream, cookies, fudge, brownies, cream puffs, waffles, pumpkin seeds, and pumpkin pie. Over the course of the event, approximately 23,000 pumpkin pies and more than 100,000 pumpkin donuts are sold from local vendors. There are also many other festival foods available at various stands throughout the event.
Due to its popularity, the Pumpkin Show also has a song, ""The Punkin Show,"" written and composed by M. W. ""Burk"" Burkhart in 1952 (published in 1977).
People from over 34 states and 13 different countries have been documented to have attended the festival in the most recent years.

The two-day event hosted in various locales on Delmarva features poultry equipment trade shows, the Miss Del-Mar-Va contest, the National Chicken Cooking Contest, a parade, arts and crafts, a carnival, entertainment, and food concessions. Chicken is the featured food, but french fries, corn-on-the-cob, funnel cake, ice cream, kettle corn, and fresh-squeezed lemonade are other local favorites. Nearly three tons of chicken are cooked each year in the world's largest frying pan. The pan made its debut at the second annual festival in 1950. The first and original pan was used and made by the Mumford Sheet Metal Company in Selbyville, Delaware, and was ""given to the Delmarva Poultry Industry for use in promoting chicken produced on the Delmarva Peninsula"". It was ten feet in diameter and had an eight-foot handle, was 18 inches deep, required 180 gallons of cooking oil and 150 gallons of LP gas, weighed 650 pounds, and could hold 800 chicken quarters.

The festival was Gilroy's top fundraiser, staffed with volunteers to raise money for nonprofit groups including clubs and schools.

History
The inaugural Garlic Festival was held in 1979. Rudolph J. Malone, then President of Gavilan College in Gilroy, was inspired by a small town in France which hosted an annual garlic festival and claimed to be the ""Garlic Capital of the World."" Malone started the festival, which attracted hundreds of thousands of paying visitors a year.

2019 shooting
On July 28, 2019, a mass shooting occurred at the 41st edition of the festival. Three people were killed, in addition to the gunman, and 12 others were injured.

COVID-19 pandemic and cancellation
The festival was cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while 2021 saw a drive-thru festival. In April 2022, the Gilroy Garlic Festival Association announced that the event would be canceled thereafter due to prolonged losses, ""lingering uncertainties from the pandemic,"" and ""prohibitive insurance requirements by the City of Gilroy"" since the 2019 shooting.

California Garlic Festival
The California Garlic Festival has been held annually since 2022 in response to the cancellation of the Gilroy Garlic Festival. The California Garlic Festival is sometimes considered a successor of the Gilroy Garlic Festival, although they are held by two unrelated organizers.

2025 revival
On March 28, 2025, the Gilroy Garlic Festival Association announced the Garlic Festival would return July 25-27, 2025. The 2025 Festival will be held at Gilroy Gardens. Attendance will be limited to 3,000 per day, compared to past festivals that had 100,000 attendees.

In popular culture
The Garlic Festival was featured by Huell Howser in Road Trip Episode 124.

The festival was created to promote Jackson County's leading agricultural product, which at the time was grown by over forty farms in the area.

Dates
The Apple Festival is held on the third weekend in September.  The festival starts at noon on Tuesday and ends on Saturday night.

Locations
Starting on the Saturday before the festival, downtown streets (Broadway St. between Water St. and Walnut St.; Main St. between Columbia St. and Portsmouth St.; and Pearl St. between Church St. and Portsmouth St.) are closed in Jackson.  They are reopened by 5:00 pm on Sunday.

History
In the spring of 1937, a group of members from the Jackson Chamber of Commerce decided to create a festival that would help promote the county's leading industry.
The Apple Festival has been held annually since 1937, but was silenced from 1942 to 1945 during World War II & 2020 caused by COVID-19 pandemic.

Traditions
The Friday night home high-school football game, at Jackson High School during the week of the festival, is dubbed ""The Apple Bowl.""
Several parades are held during the festival.  A school parade is held on Wednesday afternoon.  Wednesday evening is the Opening Parade.  Thursday at noon is the Pre-School Parade.
The Saturday night ""Grande Finale"" Parade is the festival's biggest event, with over 70,000 people attending, and has a claim as ""the largest lighted parade in Ohio.""  The parade annually includes local dignitaries and politicians, neighboring festival royalty, and invited high school marching bands from across southern and southeastern Ohio and northern West Virginia; as well as ""floats"" from each of the elementary schools in and around Jackson, which depict the annual theme of the festival.  The Budweiser Clydesdale Horses have been a part of this parade two times during the 1990s.  On September 21, 2001, The Ohio State University Marching Band (TBDBITL) performed a halftime field show at the Jackson High School football field, and that night marched in the Festival parade for the first time; the Ohio State Alumni Band has also made several appearances in the parade lineup.  The U.S. Marine Corps Band appeared in the 2007 parade.
Another long-standing tradition of the Jackson County Apple Festival is a pageant for the Apple Festival Queen.

During 2021 the city held the Paintsville Autumn Fest. In 2022 the Kentucky Apple Festival returned and continue their time honored tradition.

History
The first Kentucky Apple Festival was held on October 6, 1962, and was known as ""Apple Day"". It was guided by Elmon Davis, an officer at Citizens National Bank and apple orchard owner from Flat Gap. Davis not only created the festival to promote the county's apple production, but to compete with the Johnson County Fair, which had been held annually since 1914. Eventually, the Kentucky Apple Festival became the more popular of the two and the Johnson County Fair became nonexistent.
In June 2020, officials decided to scrap the 2020 festival as the COVID-19 pandemic was the cause.

Traditions
Although the majority of the festivities occur on the first Friday and Saturday in October, many events occur during the last week of September, adding up to over forty-five events. Traditional events include: Junior and Miss Apple Blossom pageant; school competitions in spelling, art, penmanship, and mathematics; old-fashion costume contest; terrapin trot (turtle race); multiple concerts; car shows; Ducky Derby (Rubber duck race on Paint Creek) and the Apple Festival Parade. One of the festival's largest and most popular events prior to 2009 was the Apple Bowl. The annual football game between Paintsville High School and Johnson Central High School was halted after 2008 due to the difference in the size of the two schools.

History
The idea for an annual festival was first brought up in 1983 by Joe Sink, Jr., publisher of Lexington's daily newspaper, The Dispatch. He approached the bank BB&T, which agreed to look into the idea and hired Kay Saintsing, a local organization developer and manager, to conduct a study of the feasibility of such a festival. The investigation concluded that the festival was a valid idea, as Lexington was already a popular weekend destination for barbecue, and the first festival was held October 27, 1984.

The Lexington Barbecue Festival was to become one of the nation's most popular food festivals. The first festival attracted 30,000 people, and the barbecue chefs cooked 3,000 pounds of barbecue to meet demand;  by 1994, attendance had risen to over 100,000, and 11,000 pounds of meat were cooked. In 1995, the North Carolina Championship Pork Cook-Off was held in conjunction with the festival, allowing visitors from the Piedmont to watch whole-hog cooking experts from the eastern part of the state demonstrate their methods.The festival is held each October in uptown Lexington. Several city blocks on main street, are closed to vehicle traffic for the event. Besides barbecue, there are typically over 400 other vendors of arts and crafts, homemade fudge and other wares. Over the years, sponsors have included Childress Vineyards, Pepsi, BB&T, Walmart, and other large and local corporations.
When the festival first started in 1984, the participants were primarily local restaurants and a few local merchants. Since then it has grown to hundreds of vendors displaying every type of product. While the primary focus is still the barbecue, a large number of merchants sell other items that are unique to the area.
The festival went virtual in 2020.

Amtrak station
During the festival, NC By Train establishes a temporary train station a block away, which is served by Amtrak's Carolinian and Piedmont.

""Pork-Barrel Politics""
While the focus of the festival is Lexington style barbecue, several vendors of the eastern variety can also be found, sparking mild (and sometimes not so mild) controversy.  The battle of Lexington style vs. eastern style has even gone as far as the state government.  In 2006, North Carolina House Bill 21 and North Carolina Senate Bill 47 were introduced and would have made the Lexington Barbecue Festival the official barbecue festival of North Carolina.  A separate amended bill, North Carolina House Bill suggested making the Lexington Barbecue Festival the official food festival of North Carolina.  Neither garnered enough support to pass, as nearly half of the state favors the eastern style barbecue, sparking genuine controversy about the bill incidentally creating an ""official state barbecue"" (as opposed to just the festival) with either Lexington or eastern style.
One example of the more light-hearted feud that exists between the proponents of the two types of barbecue is when author Jerry Bledsoe, the self-professed ""world's leading, foremost barbecue authority."" claimed that Dennis Rogers, (columnist for The Raleigh News & Observer and self-professed ""oracle of the holy grub."") ""has ruined any chances of this state being distinguished in its barbecue.""  While a degree of humor is involved, choice of barbecue type is a politically charged topic.

Official status
In 2007, NC House Bill 433 passed, granting the Lexington Barbecue Festival the  title ""Official Food Festival of the Piedmont Triad Region of the State of North Carolina"".  By excluding the eastern part of the state when making an official designation, they effectively bypassed any controversy regarding eastern barbecue and avoided any style of barbecue being considered the ""official"" barbecue for the State of North Carolina.

Other activities
Some of the other activities include lumberlack games, live music from up to five different stages, and street performers.

In conjunction with each festival, a queen's pageant is held; an individual is named King Fur to represent the industry being honored; a cookbook is published which contains photographs and winners from the previous festival; a parade is held, and the festival hosts a delegation from its sister festival, the National Outdoor Show from Cambridge MD.
Festival contests include oyster shucking, muskrat and nutria skinning, skeet shooting, trap setting, and duck and goose calling, and a Gumbo Cook-off. A booth located on the fairgrounds showcases the history of the festival. The festival also features carnival rides, exhibits, live music and dancing, and regional food.

History
Inaugural festival
The event originated in 1955 when U.S. Congressman Theo Ashton Thompson arranged the first fur and wildlife competition.
The congressman of Cambridge, Maryland challenged Representative Thompson to send a local resident to compete in the National Fur Skinning Contest. Fifty-two-year-old Leon Hebert, a 25-year trapper, from Cameron was sent to the National Outdoor Show where he placed fifth in the nation that year.
A small group of people met during the summer of 1955 in the Cameron Courthouse Building, to make plans for the first festival.  Whitney Stine was chairman.   Representatives of community organizations included: Whitney Stine - Cameron Lion's Club ((Lions Clubs International)), Edward Swindell, Sr. - Cameron Lion's Club, Hadley Fontenot - County Agent, Alvin Dyson - State Representative, Ray Burleigh - Cameron Lion's Club, Joe O'Donnell -Cameron Lion's Club, Mrs. Iva Free - Home Demonstration Agent, Roberta Rogers - Home Demonstration Club, Geneva Griffith - Home Demonstration Club and Sam Tarlton - Lake Charles Television and Radio Station. 

From this group of organizers came the Louisiana Fur & Wildlife Festival. The first festival was funded by the Cameron Parish Police Jury and private donations. This was to become known as ""ONE OF THE OLDEST AND COLDEST FESTIVALS IN LOUISIANA"" In 1962 and 1973 the festival was postponed for one week due to a severe cold wave.
Jennings B. Jones, Jr. served as master of ceremonies for the program on Dec 2 and 3, 1955. It was presided over by Cameron County Agent Hadley Fontenot, first festival president.
Seventeen-year-old Vida Bess Brown, from Abbeville, was crowned ""Miss Outdoor of Louisiana"" by Ted O'Neal, Chief of the Fur and Bottoms Division of the Louisiana Wildlife Commission. She was presented with a nutria stole, a bouquet of roses by the Cameron Service Garage, and an expense paid trip to the National Outdoors Show in Cambridge, Maryland. The National Outdoor Show became a ""Sister Festival"" with the Cameron Festival. The two exchanged fur skinners and festival queens each year and the tradition continues today.
Of 34 contestants, Meredith Giles was named the first ""Cameron Parish Queen"".  Eleven-year-old J. A. Miller captured the Louisiana Junior Duck Calling contest and in years to come he became the World Champion Fur Skinner, following in the footsteps of his father Fletcher, and teaching his daughter Selika the art with her becoming the Women's Champion.  His wife, Mary Jane Miller, held the Local and National Women's title many times.

Second festival
The second annual festival was held on January 11–12, 1957 and $5000.00 in cash and trips were awarded along with fur coats to the Fur Queen contestants.
Nancy Precht was crowned Fur Queen by Louisiana House of Representative, Alvin Dyson.  She represented the festival at the Mardi Gras Ball in Washington, D.C. where she was presented to Vice-President and Mrs. Nixon.  This tradition continues to the present time.
Floats were usually constructed in warehouses of the local menhaden plants, mud houses, garages, or anywhere workers could get out of the cold. Roland ""Bolo"" Trosclair was in charge of the parade at that time. 
A raccoon was chosen as mascot for the festival. A contest of the area school children determined that Sha-oui would be the name of the mascot.
In Dec 1956, festival authorities invited major fur production parishes to attend; St Charles, St Bernard, St John, St. Mary, Jefferson, Plaquemines, Terrebonne, Lafourche, Iberia, Vermilion and Cameron.

Subsequent festivals
In 1969 the first King Fur is selected.  King Fur I, Jack T. Styron represents the Menhaden (pogy fish) industry for the 14th annual Fur and Wildlife Festival. 
In 1972 the first Fur Festival Cookbook is published and continues today.
Parishes with invitations to compete for the Louisiana Fur and Wildlife Festival Queen Crown: Acadia, Allen, Ascension, Assumption, Avoyelles, Beauregard, Calcasieu, Cameron, Evangeline, Iberia, Jefferson, Jefferson Davis, Lafayette, Lafourche, Livingston, Natchitoches, Plaquemines, Rapides, Saint Bernard, Saint Charles, Saint James, Saint John the Baptist, Saint Landry, Saint Martin, Saint Mary, Saint Tammany, Sabine, Vermillion, Vernon, Washington, Tangipahoa, and Terrebonne.
Cameron Elementary School was the annual staging ground for the Louisiana Fur and Wildlife Festival pageants until Hurricane Rita. After the 2005 storm, all that remain of the auditorium were the steel girders. The festival was canceled in 2006 due to the devastation of Hurricane Rita.
Activities for the 2007 50th annual Louisiana Fur and Wildlife Festival kicked off with pageants at the Lake Charles Civic Center's Rosa Hart Theater.  The festival activities returned to the grounds of the old Cameron Elementary School in Cameron.
The Fur queen invited several of her fellow festival queens to see her Parish anyway, both in its devastation and its natural splendor. 
In the early months of 2010, the Cameron Parish 4-H Junior Leaders complete a video documentary on the history of the Louisiana Fur and Wildlife Festival. The Youth Leaders interviewed past festival participants, contestants and queens and compiled the stories into a documentary. Cameron Communications is a Festival $5,000 corporate sponsor now and in the next several years.
The 54th annual Fur and Wildlife Festival held January 13–14, 2012 in downtown Cameron LA featured dog trials, back for the first time since Hurricane Rita.
With the 2020 hurricanes, Laura and Delta, and the COVID-19 pandemic causing 2021 to go on hiatus, the 63rd was deferred to 2022.
The 63rd Louisiana Fur and Wildlife Festival was held January 8, 2022 at the Burton Complex in Lake Charles, Louisiana.
The 64th Louisiana Fur and Wildlife Festival will return January 13-14, 2023 to the Historic Cameron Courthouse fairgrounds in Cameron, Louisiana.

The event now draws more than 75,000 attendees annually. It is organized and sponsored by the Morton Chamber of Commerce.

History
The first Morton Pumpkin Festival was organized in 1967 as a fundraiser and celebration of the annual pumpkin harvest at the local Libby's plant. The plant was constructed in 1925 by the Dickinson Canning Company, which was purchased by Libby's in 1929. Nearby Eureka, Illinois claimed the title of ""Pumpkin Capital of the World"" due to its 1895 canning factory, which was consolidated with Morton's operations in the late 1950s and purchased by Nestlé in 1972. Eureka held an annual pumpking festival from 1939-1962.
In 1978, Governor James R. Thompson declared Morton the “Pumpkin Capital of the World.” Morton's title of ""Pumpkin Capital of the World"" is tied to the presence of the Nestlé-owned Libby's pumpkin processing plant, which processes more than 80 percent of the world's canned pumpkin. In 2012, Libby's became an official sponsor of the event.
Libby's has an exclusive brand of pumpkins, Dickinson Select, which about 5,000 acres (2,000 ha) are planted in Morton farmlands. According to Nestlé, ""Libby’s Dickinson Select pumpkins are grown exclusively in the rich farmlands around Morton, Illinois."" The Dickinson cultivar has a ""delicious taste, creamy texture, and pleasing orange color"", but does not look like the traditional pumpkin used for carving jack-o-lanterns.
In 2015, State Representative Keith Sommer of Morton co-sponsored a bill to make pumpkin pie the official State Pie of Illinois.
A virtual event was held in 2020 as many physical ones were scrapped because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Festival themes
Each year, the Morton Chamber of Commerce selects a special theme for the Morton Pumpkin Festival. Festival themes are voted on by the general public while taking the annual Pumpkin Festival Survey in September. The top festival theme choices are then taken to the Pumpkin Festival Oversight Committee and the Morton Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors for the final selection. Themes are announced in January or February during the Morton Chamber of Commerce Annual Meet Up.
Many of the Pumpkin Festival events and activities including the parades, pageants, entertainment, competitions, and opening ceremony incorporate costumes, music, and other elements in celebration of the annual theme.

Food
Many attendees of the festival come just for the food, especially the pumpkin flavored food. Beyond the usual fair/carnival favorites and pumpkin pie, some of the other items include pumpkin chili, pumpkin cookies, pumpkin doughnuts, pumpkin ice cream, pumpkin baked beans, pumpkin jambalaya, and pumpkin pasta salad. The marquee food-related event typically happens on the Saturday morning of the Pumpkin Festival. Saturday morning showcases the all-you-can-eat Pumpkin Pancake breakfast.
Free pumpkin pies were offered in the early festivals by Libby's. By 1984, the festival had 2,000 pies. Several organizations have been responsible for making pies over the years, including the Kitchen Made Pie Company of Peoria, Sullivan's Foods, the women of First Mennonite Church, From the Field cooking school, and Tazewell County Resource Center.
In 1977, the pork chop BBQ was introduced and sold 3,900 pork chops, an amount which doubled the next year. Bill Wilson, the Chamber of Commerce president, introduced pumpkin pancakes in 1983; in 1984, they sold an estimated 5,000 pancakes. In 1984, over 1,000 pumpkin cookies were sold. In 1985, pumpkin chili and pumpkin ice cream joined the menu. In 1990, Thompson's Food Basket created a giant pumpkin bar that measured 30 ft long, 3 ft wide, weighed over 750 lbs, and could feed over 6,000 people. Pumpkin donuts were added to the lineup in 1998. In 2014, pumpkin cornbread was sold for the Pumpkins of the West theme.

Punkin Chuckin'
The Punkin Chuckin' Contest was a Morton tradition that involved giant contraptions that hurled, catapulted, or shot 5-10 pound pumpkins in the air into an open field. The competition began in 1996 and its last year was 2016. Competitors competed for the title of “Punkin' Chucker Supreme” with a one-mile goal. The contest was modeled after the contest in Sussex County, Delaware (which plans to move to Rantoul, Illinois in November 2019) the first weekend after Halloween, but Morton holds the world record for farthest pumpkin thrown.
The Punkin Chuckin’ Contest turned out various machines, from trebuchets to air cannons, with one machine holding a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records. The Q-36 Pumpkin Modulator is a 100-foot (30 m) long air cannon that fired a pumpkin 4,680 feet (1,430 m) for a world record (the record as of November 2010 is held by team Big 10 Inch at 5545.43 ft). The Q-36 has an 80-foot (24 m) barrel and a 1,800-US-gallon (6,800 L) air tank and tips the scale at 36,000 pounds (16,000 kg). A pumpkin leaving the tube flies at nearly 681 miles per hour (1,096 km/h) but loses velocity quickly. This cannon has been seen on the Late Show with David Letterman as well as another famous device, the Acme Catapult, which saw airtime on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in 2003.

Entertainment and performances
The Entertainment Stage used to be housed in the Food Tent, but moved outside in 2009. Entertainment includes local musical acts, lip sync contests, and pie eating contests. ""Pumpkin Idol"", modeled after American Idol, premiered in 2010.
Local acts over the years have included:  Beatles cover band American English, Elvis impersonator Lee Hall, the Jim Markum Swing Band, Gut Bucket Band which later became the Central Illinois Banjo Club.
Performances in 2019 included: Morton High School (Morton, Illinois), Central Illinois Banjo Club, New Odyssey Guy, Bogside Zukes, Cousin Eddie, Jim Markum Swing Band, and American English.
The carnival has been a part of the festival since its inception, hosted by Big M amusements.

The festival culminates with the IFOCE sanctioned Buffalo Wing eating contest, which has taken place the Sunday of the festival since 2003, except 2020 when it was canceled.

Event history
This festival was inaugurated in 2002 at Sahlen Field. Founder Drew Cerza, called the ""Wing King"" by Buffalo News, was said to have modeled the event on a fictitious festival from the 2001 movie Osmosis Jones.
Jill Greenburg said, ""Of local festivals that have come and gone, the Wing Fest's staying power is a result of raising approximately $200,000 for local charities and serving almost 3,000,000 chicken wings with 100 sauce varieties to over 500,000 hungry visitors over the years."" In 2010, the festival was video webcast live to over 84,000 online viewers.
On September 2, 2012, Joey Chestnut consumed 191 wings, weighing 7.61 pounds (3.45 kg), in 12 minutes to take competitive-eating trophy from seven-time champion Sonya Thomas, becoming the first new champion since 2006. After losing to Miki Sudo in 2013, Chestnut returned to his winning ways in 2014 by breaking his own record by eating 192 wings and successfully defended his title the next year by breaking yet another record, this time eating 205 wings on September 6, 2015. Two years later, he set another record, this time of 220 wings on September 3, 2017. Geoff Esper holds the record of 281 in 2019.
With the 2020 festival canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 19th was deferred to 2021. However, the Chicken Wing Fun Run went virtual. The 2021 event was held at Highmark Stadium, to which the festival returned in 2022. The 2022 festival also added a qualifying event for the USA Mullet Championships, which Cerza found to be a fitting synergy given the haircut's popularity in ice hockey, a popular sport in Buffalo.
The event will return to Sahlen Field beginning in 2025.

Event contests
Contests at the National Buffalo Wing Festival include:

US Chicken Wing Eating Championship
Amateur Chicken Wing Eating
Amateur Traditional Sauce Contest
Amateur Creative Sauce Contest
Ridiculously Hot Wing Eating Contest
Miss Buffalo Wing
Bobbing for Wings
Baby Wing

Yancey's Fancy Cheesiest Couple Contest
Yancey's Fancy Cheesy Dance-Off Contest

History
Traverse City cherries
In 1839, Revered Peter Dougherty, a Presbyterian missionary, established a Native American mission at present-day Old Mission, near the tip of the Old Mission Peninsula. In 1852, Dougherty planted the first cherry trees, which flourished, much to the surprise of locals, who began to plant trees themselves. The first commercial cherry orchard was established in 1893. By the beginning of the 20th century, much of the Lake Michigan shoreline, especially the area surrounding Traverse City, was the center of a well-established cherry-growing industry.

Festival history
The very first festival was held in May 1925, and was known as the Blessing of the Blossoms. The first cherry queen was Gertrude Brown. In 1931, the Michigan Legislature renamed the festival to the National Cherry Festival, and moved to July. The festival was cancelled from 1942 to 1946 due to World War II, and again in 1947, as Traverse City instead celebrated its centennial. In 1964, the festival was extended from three days to five, and in 1968, was extended to eight days. In 1975, President Gerald Ford, a Michigan native, attended the festival, and led the Cherry Royale Parade as Grand Marshal.
On July 25, 1987, Cherry Festival participants earned a place in the Guinness Book of World Records for baking the world's largest cherry pie. The pie was 17 ft 6 in (5.33 m) in diameter, weighing 28,350 pounds. This replaced the pie baked nine years earlier in Charlevoix, Michigan. This record was held until July 14, 1990, when a pie weighing 37,740 lb 10 oz (17,118.9 kg), 20 feet (6.1 m) in diameter was baked and eaten by approximately 1500 people in Oliver, British Columbia.
In 2021, the festival garnered national attention when on July 8, a Magic Carpet ride at the festival's midway malfunctioned and began to lean and sway. Bystanders rushed to the ride and held it down by its guardrails until the ride came to a stop. No serious injuries were reported, and shortly after, the ride was dismantled.

2020 postponement
In 2020, Festival Officials announced on Thursday, April 16, 2020, that the 90th National Cherry Festival was to be postponed until the following year. This postponement was in light of global health concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. The festival restarted in 2021.

In 2005, several wineries from the Yadkin Valley AVA withdrew from the event, citing low sales and limited exposure compared to other events and activities at the festival. The Yadkin Valley Winegrowers Association subsequently organized their own festival, held shortly after the NC Wine Festival.

The AVA encompasses 609,673 acres (953 sq mi) with approximately 18,500 acres (7,487 ha) cultivated with wine grapes known for their heritage varietal Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Rhône-style wines.

History
The name of the area dates from the late 18th Century, the missionary settlement period. The full Spanish name is ""El Paso de Robles"" or ""the Pass of the Oaks."" This name was given by travelers between the San Miguel mission, located within the boundaries of the viticultural area, and Mission San Luis Obispo. A land grant, in this name, was conveyed by Governor Micheltorena to Pedro Narvaez on May 12, 1844. This land grant includes the present areas of Paso Robles, Templeton, and Adelaida. The land grant was patented on July 20, 1866, to Petronillo Rios. In 1857 the Paso Robles land grant was purchased by three men. These men, capitalizing on the hot springs and
mud baths of the area, set out to make the Paso Robles Hot Springs one of the finest resort spas in the Country and built the first of the famous hotels. The community serving the hotel and resort visitors was incorporated as the City of El Paso de Robles on February 25, 1889. Since that time, the entire area of the viticultural area has been referred to as the Paso Robles area.
Grapes were first introduced into the Paso Robles area in 1787 by Spanish missionaries at Mission San Miguel Arcangel, founded in 1797, produced wine and it is assumed that the grapes were harvested in nearby areas. The earliest date was 1873 showing that approximately 40 acres (16 ha) were vineyards. One winery established in the last century is still involved in wine production, Rotta Winery, now Mid•point Wine. In addition to this winery, there are twelve others and one under construction. There were 62 existing vineyards at the establishment of Paso Robles viticultural area comprising approximately 5,000 acres (2,023 ha) with more grape plantings planned, generally adjacent to or in close proximity to the existing vineyards.  Commercial wine growing, however, was not started until the 1880s with the establishment of Ascension Winery, later known as York Mountain Winery, and today known as Epoch Estate Wines. In 1914, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, the famous Polish pianist, conductor, and statesman, established a vineyard on his ranch. The Zinfandel grape was introduced to the area in this vineyard. Wine produced by York Mountain Winery from this vineyard was awarded a gold medal at the California State Fair.
Since 1990, when there were fewer than 20 wineries in Paso Robles, a large expansion of activity has seen the number rise to more than 200 wineries today. Wine critic Robert M. Parker, Jr. commented on the region's promise of quality of wine, emphasizing the wineries L'Aventure, Linne Calodo, Saxum Vineyards, Doce Robles ""Twelve Oaks"" Winery & Vineyard, Villa Creek Cellars, Castoro Cellars and Tablas Creek Vineyard as the ""leading Paso pioneers"".

Viticulture Expansion
In 2007, a proposal was submitted to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), Treasury to split the area at the Salinas River and form a new ""Paso Robles Westside AVA."" The proposal was withdrawn in 2009, however, additional proposals were also submitted to the TTB naming eleven separate viticultural areas within Paso Robles AVA documenting their unique terroir characteistics. The proposed viticultural areas were: Adelaida District, Creston District, El Pomar District, Paso Robles Estrella District, Paso Robles Geneseo District, Paso Robles Highlands District, Paso Robles Willow Creek District, San Juan Creek, San Miguel District, Santa Margarita Ranch, and Templeton Gap District.
On October 9, 2014, the TTB issued a Final Rule in the Federal Register after reviewing the petitions submitted in 2007 by the Paso Robles American Viticultural Area Committee (PRAVAC)  establishing eleven new viticultural areas located entirely within the existing 669,253 acres (1,045.708 sq mi) Paso Robles viticultural area adjacent to the northern boundary of San Luis Obispo County. The new viticultural areas were: Adelaida District, Creston District, El Pomar District, Paso Robles Estrella District, Paso Robles Geneseo District, Paso Robles Highlands District, Paso Robles Willow Creek District, San Juan Creek, San Miguel District, Santa Margarita Ranch, and Templeton Gap District.

Wine Industry
The Paso Robles AVA is still acknowledged for its heritage grape, Zinfandel, but has gained recognition from a wider range of grape varietals as well. In the 1950s and 1960s, growers began to plant Bordeaux varieties, particularly Cabernet Sauvignon, in the area. Starting in the 1980s, there have been increased plantings of many Rhône varieties, including the first Syrah planted in California, as well as Viognier and Roussanne to name a few. The emerging popularity of the region's wines led it to become the first site of the bi-annual ""Hospice du Rhône"" conference on Rhône style wine. Today, Paso Robles Wine Country is receiving attention for its unique Paso blends. These wines are unique to the area, and with varietal make-ups that do not follow traditional rules and expectations of winemaking, as characteristic in other regions of the wine world.

Wine Festivals
The Paso Robles Zinfandel Festival, now known as Vintage Paso: Zinfandel Weekend, is a festival focused on the Paso Robles area's heritage grape, Zinfandel. This event is held by the Paso Robles Wine Country Alliance, a non-profit cooperative marketing alliance. 
The Paso Robles Wine Festival is a festival focused on the wide variety of wines the area produces, held in Paso Robles' downtown city park. Attendees have the opportunity to talk with the Paso Robles vintners and taste their wines.
The Harvest Wine Weekend is a celebration of the harvest season with three days of hands-on Paso Robles Wine Country activities.
In 2015, the Paso Robles Wine Country Alliance started a new festival, BlendFest on the Coast, dedicated to the unique wine blends of Paso Robles, held on the coast in San Simeon and Cambria.

Established in 1959, Schmeckfest showcases the traditional foods, crafts and talents of the Freeman community with Mennonite food, demonstrations, displays, programs and a full-stage musical theater production. 
Current information about Schmeckfest is available at Schmeckfest Web site.
Schmeckfest has been held every spring since and has grown to accommodate more than 5,000 guests every year. The event is held at Freeman Academy, a grade 1 to 12 private school, and raises about $90,000 annually for the school.
A multi-course meal and a musical are the main fundraising events. The festival also includes displays, programs, demonstrations and sales of ethnic handcrafts and culinary arts. In recent years, Heritage Hall Museum and Archives, located adjacent to the Freeman Academy campus, offers historical presentations during Schmeckfest.
The Schmeckfest meal was served buffet style in the early years before switching to family style in 1965. In 2018, buffet-style serving returned for the 60th Schmeckfest, which is part of an emphasis on the historic nature of the 2018 observance and continues as the dining format.

Beginning
South Dakota Mennonite College was founded in 1900, and three years later, classes began in ""The College"" building (today's ""Music Hall""), located one-quarter mile south of the downtown area of Freeman, S.D. Today, Freeman Academy is a private Christian school for grades 1-12.
The first Schmeckfest was Friday, March 13, 1959. The German ""tasting festival"" was served buffet style in the basement of Pioneer Hall in Freeman, SD. All guests were encouraged to ""take all you want, but eat all you take"". The cost of meal tickets was one dollar for adults and fifty cents for grade school children. Preschool-aged kids ate free. Serving began at 5:00 p.m. followed at 7:00 by a ""period of relaxation with recorded German music"" and a talent program. The popularity of that first festival exceeded expectations; many people were disappointed to learn the food was gone by the time they arrived. But the organizers, the Freeman Junior College Women's Auxiliary, saw the interest in the event and the potential it offered. The second Schmeckfest was held in 1960 and the festival became an annual event.
Since then Schmeckfest has expanded to two days, then to three days and later to four days — two days for two consecutive weekends in March or April. Following a three-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020-22, Schmeckfest returned in 2023 as a one-weekend festival; that format continues.

The festival has raised more than $360,000 for charities, and awards five $1,000 scholarships each year to local high school students looking to pursue culinary or hospitality degrees. The 30th Annual Taste of Buffalo presented by Tops Friendly Markets took place on July 13 and 14, 2013. In 2018, the festival celebrated its 35th anniversary.

History
Arnie Morton, creator of the Taste, decided to line up Chicago restaurants to participate and persuaded then-Chicago mayor Jane Byrne and Commissioner of Cultural Affairs Lois Weisberg to block off Michigan Avenue for the first Taste of Chicago on July 4, 1980. Although organizers expected 100,000 people, a crowd of over 250,000 showed up, with food and soda sales grossing $300,000 at the festival's inception. The next year, the Taste of Chicago was moved to Grant Park and grew in size and scope, becoming a 10-day event with more food vendors and musical performers; it also became the world's largest food festival.
ChicagoFest, started by mayor Michael Bilandic, was the precursor to the Taste of Chicago. After Bilandic's tenure in office, newly elected Mayor Jane Byrne attempted to end the festival as well as many other programs associated with the former mayor. Many Chicagoans disapproved of Mayor Byrne's attempt to stop the festivities (although attendance at ChicagoFest had begun to wane). She and her successor, Mayor Harold Washington, dedicated more time and energy to promoting the Taste, slowly phasing ChicagoFest out in the process. Mayor Washington finally put an end to ChicagoFest when in 1983 it was moved from Navy Pier to Soldier Field and attendance continued to wane. The popularity of the Taste of Chicago has prompted other cities to spawn numerous offshoots and equivalents throughout North America such as the Taste of Champaign, CityFest in Detroit, the Taste of the Danforth in Toronto, the Taste of Kalamazoo, Taste of Addison, Taste of Denver, Taste in Dallas, Taste of Madison, Taste of Austin, the Taste of Peoria in Peoria, Illinois, and the Bite in Portland to name a few. The first ""taste of"" festival was Taste of Cincinnati in 1979.
In 2005, the Taste attracted about 3.9 million people with over 70 food vendors. Foods at the event include Chicago-style pizza, Chicago hot dogs, barbecued ribs, Italian Beef, Maxwell Street Polish Sausage, Eli's Cheesecake, and a variety of ethnic and regional foods.  A total of 3.6 million people visited the 2006 Taste of Chicago. Attendance for the previous record 10-day event, in 2004, was 3.59 million, with $12.33 million in revenue. These lackluster statistics prompted several changes. The mayor transferred power over the event from the Chicago Park District to the Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events, and the event was shortened to 5 days. In 2012, the Taste of Chicago ran from July 11 to July 15 and had 36 participating restaurants. In 2013, the Taste of Chicago turned a profit for the first time in six years with sales totaling $272,000. On Saturday, July 12, 2014, the Taste of Chicago closed because of severe weather—the first time the festival was canceled for the entire day because of ""excessive rainfall and flooding on the festival grounds"".
In June 2020, the event was one of several Chicago events officially cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it was replaced by ""Taste of Chicago To-Go"" programming that included an online directory of vendors, video cooking demonstrations and performances, a food truck procession, and an expansion of the existing Community Eats program that brings free meals to first responders.

2007 salmonella outbreak
On July 12, 2007, city officials reported that an outbreak beginning in the Pars Cove Persian Cuisine booth caused 17 people to fall ill due to salmonella poisoning.  Of those affected, three were hospitalized, including one minor. City officials started to receive reports of sickness on Monday but waited to issue a notice until Wednesday.  The notice warned the public about symptoms and causes behind the bacteria that is spread by consuming foods contaminated with animal feces. After a thorough investigation of the Pars Cove Persian Cuisine booth, it was determined that the cucumber, hummus, and pomegranate chicken were the source of the illness.  The booth failed a previous routine inspection for serving undercooked dishes but city officials did not file the report until Wednesday. City health inspectors found several violations at the restaurant including unsanitary conditions, improper refrigeration, and mouse droppings.

History
In 1895, the festival was originally named Festival of Mountain and Plain. The festival started as a carnival similar to New Orleans’ Mardi Gras. The goal of the carnival was to boost the city's morale and vitality after the Silver Panic. The festival was ultimately unsuccessful in ending Denver's economic depression.  After a decline in attendance the carnival ended in 1902 . In 1983, the Downtown Denver Partnership decided to bring back the spirit of the original Festival to commemorate the opening of the 16th Street Mall. ""A Taste of Colorado"" was added to the Festival of Mountain and Plain name and concept and moved back to Civic Center Park in Downtown Denver, where the event first began.

The festival also includes numerous forms of entertainment, carnival attractions, amateur talent competitions, and a parade.

Attendance
In 2014, festival chairman Tom Moore, had estimated that 30,000 people visit the festival a day, with other members estimating 70,000 on the busiest days. In 2023, the West Side Nutclub had estimated 200,000 people had visited the festival leading up to the weeks end, with around 15,000 to 40,000 visiting a day. Although he lacked statistics to support his claim, radio host Paul Harvey once called it the second-largest street festival in the U.S. in terms of attendees, behind only the New Orleans Mardi Gras. It is important to note that New Orleans Mardi Gras is not a street festival. The closest comparisons are New York City's street festivals, such as the Atlantic Antic, New York's Village Halloween Parade, and Taste of Buffalo festivals.

History
After three successful years of holding Halloween type Festivals, a handful of West Side businessmen decided, in 1921, to form an organization that would handle the duties of putting together successful Fall Festivals and “to initiate, promote, and support any and all movements which are for the betterment of the West Side of Evansville, Indiana; also for the betterment of Evansville as a whole.” The first West Side Nut Club Fall Festival was billed as a Halloween Night, Halloween Carnival, and masked ball. The event was a one night affair and consisted of a parade of costumed people followed by a Halloween Mask Ball. The crowd was estimated at 25,000.
After the first Festival, the Nut Club continued with the one or two night affairs until after World War II. During most of those Festivals, the Nut Club coordinated the decorations, agricultural exhibits, and parades while the Burdette Post of the American Legion sponsored street dances. In 1940, organizers incorporated three rides (Ferris wheel, merry-go-round & mini autos) and an exhibit of caged animals, concessions, and circus acts. In 1942 the rides were moved to the library park on Franklin Street.
Due to World War II, the Festival was halted from 1943 to 1945. In 1946, the festival commenced again and for the first time extended most of the week from Monday through Saturday. During the 1950s the festival experienced substantial growth. Non-profit organizations began selling food in booths on Franklin Street. In 1952, Howell Baptist Church put up its first booth which, according to church sources, served the festival's first Pronto Pups. The 1950s also ushered in larger rides and more well known entertainers.
2020 marked the first cancellation in 75 years. The next year will be its centennial anniversary, its 97th overall. Instead they just held a half-pot drawing.
The Nut Club holds a half-pot drawing each year during the fall festival since 2019. 2022's half-pot was the largest to date with a total pot of $1.64 million.

Traditions
Entertainment
The Fall Festival commences on a Sunday and runs all week. Each day includes several music and dance performances by local bands and youth. Saturday, the last day of the festival, is marked by a large parade. The parade is large and draws substantial crowds each year. In 2016, Evansville native Lilly King, a two-time Olympic Gold medalist in the same year, asked to be grand marshal of the parade; the request was granted. King noted, ""When you make the Olympic team you get to grand marshal the Fall Festival parade . Fall Festival is a holiday. It’s my favorite holiday. As a Westsider, I have to love Fall Festival.""

Fried brain sandwich
The fair features fried brain sandwiches, a local speciality consisting of battered and deep fried calf or pig brains served on a bun.

History
Christmas on the River began in 1972 as a night parade of decorated and lighted floats on riverboats along the river at White Bluff.  This was followed by a fireworks show.  These main events have continued and the festival has been expanded over the years to now include several functions in the week prior to the nautical parade.

Events
Christmas on the River begins with a matinee by the Canebrake Players, a local theatrical group. Other events during the week include a reading of The Christmas Story in the Demopolis Town Square, the Alabama Barbecue Championship, the crowning of Saint Nicholas which acknowledges the community members for their work in helping children, the ""Lighting of the Tree"" celebration, candlelight house tours, a community-wide church service, a concert by the Alabama Boychoir, the Children's Day Christmas Parade, and the Jingle Bell Run.
The Alabama Barbecue Championship is an event involving teams from nine states, 75 judges, and roughly 8000 participants.  It became the official state barbecue championship on December 18, 1991.  The ""Christmas in the Canebrake"" party is held at Bluff Hall, Gaineswood, and Lyon Hall, three of Demopolis' antebellum homes, the night before the finale. It includes special candlelight evening tours featuring 19th-century-style holiday decorations of fresh fruit and greenery, confections, and yuletide entertainment.

History
Early history
The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi River in what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming (including cross-dressing). An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing of masks in the streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed whenever such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned.
In 1833, Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras celebration. James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other Miscellaneous Pieces describes New Orleans Mardi Gras in 1835:

Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for fun, frolic, and comic masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active operation. Men and boys, women and girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert themselves to invent and appear in grotesque, quizzical, diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts and birds, beasts and birds with human heads; demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from the moon; mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts, coaches, cars, &c., in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming, fiddling, fifeing, and all throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way.
In 1856, 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret society to observe Mardi Gras with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mistick Krewe of Comus. According to one historian, ""Comus was aggressively English in its celebration of what New Orleans had always considered a French festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than this parade that the lead in the holiday had passed from French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and its Creoles. To a certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of how their business prowess helped them construct a more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in organized Carnival passed from Creole to American just as political and economic power did over the course of the nineteenth century. The spectacle of Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to compete with Creoles in the ballrooms and on the streets, represents the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely American.""

In 1875, Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday. War, economic, political, and weather conditions sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American Civil War, World War I and World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.
The 1898, Rex parade, with the theme of ""Harvest Queens"", was filmed by the American Mutoscope Co. The rumored but long-lost recording was rediscovered in 2022. The two-minute film records 6 parade floats, including one transporting a live ox. In December 2022, the film was deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" by the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.

20th and 21st centuries
In 1979, the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official parades were canceled or moved to surrounding communities, such as Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly fewer tourists than usual came to the city. Masking, costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with National Guard troops maintaining order. Guardsmen prevented crimes against persons or property but made no attempt to enforce laws regulating morality or drug use; for these reasons, some in the French Quarter bohemian community recall 1979 as the city's best Mardi Gras ever.
In 1991, the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social organizations, including Mardi Gras Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation, to obtain parade permits and other public licenses. Shortly after the law was passed, the city demanded that these krewes provide them with membership lists, contrary to the long-standing traditions of secrecy and the distinctly private nature of these groups. In protest—and because the city claimed the parade gave it jurisdiction to demand otherwise-private membership lists—the 19th-century krewes Comus and Momus stopped parading. Proteus did parade in the 1992 Carnival season but also suspended its parade for a time, returning to the parade schedule in 2000.
Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law as unconstitutional. Two federal courts later declared that the ordinance was an unconstitutional infringement on First Amendment rights of free association, and an unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups subject to the ordinance. The US Supreme Court refused to hear the city's appeal from this decision.
Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone who pays dues, and any member can have a place on a parade float.

Effects of Hurricane Katrina
The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, caused a few people to question the future of the city's Mardi Gras celebrations. Mayor Nagin, who was up for reelection in early 2006, tried to play this sentiment for electoral advantage. However, the economics of Carnival were, and are, too important to the city's revival.
The city government, essentially bankrupt after Hurricane Katrina, pushed for a scaled back celebration to limit strains on city services. However, many krewes insisted that they wanted to and would be ready to parade, so negotiations between krewe leaders and city officials resulted in a compromise schedule. It was scaled back but less severely than originally suggested.

The 2006 New Orleans Carnival schedule included the Krewe du Vieux on its traditional route through Marigny and the French Quarter on February 11, the Saturday two weekends before Mardi Gras. There were several parades on Saturday, February 18, and Sunday the 19th a week before Mardi Gras. Parades followed daily from Thursday night through Mardi Gras. Other than Krewe du Vieux and two Westbank parades going through Algiers, all New Orleans parades were restricted to the Saint Charles Avenue Uptown to Canal Street route, a section of the city which escaped significant flooding. Some krewes unsuccessfully pushed to parade on their traditional Mid-City route, despite the severe flood damage suffered by that neighborhood.
The city restricted how long parades could be on the street and how late at night they could end. National Guard troops assisted with crowd control for the first time since 1979. Louisiana State troopers also assisted, as they have many times in the past. Many floats had been partially submerged in floodwaters for weeks. While some krewes repaired and removed all traces of these effects, others incorporated flood lines and other damage into the designs of the floats.
Most of the locals who worked on the floats and rode on them were significantly affected by the storm's aftermath. Many had lost most or all of their possessions, but enthusiasm for Carnival was even more intense as an affirmation of life. The themes of many costumes and floats had more barbed satire than usual, with commentary on the trials and tribulations of living in the devastated city. References included MREs, Katrina refrigerators and FEMA trailers, along with much mocking of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and local and national politicians.
By the 2009 season, the Endymion parade had returned to the Mid-City route, and other Krewes expanding their parades Uptown.

2020 tandem float incidents
In 2020, two parade attendees—one during the Nyx parade, and one during the Endymion parade, were killed after being struck and run over in between interconnected ""tandem floats"" towed by a single vehicle. Following the incident during the Nyx parade, there were calls for New Orleans officials to address safety issues with these floats (including outright bans, or requiring the gaps to be filled in using a barrier). Following the second death during the Endymion parade on February 22, 2020 (which caused the parade to be halted and cancelled), city officials announced that tandem floats would be banned effective immediately, with vehicles restricted to one, single float only.

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
Unknown to the participants and local leaders at the time, the 2020 Carnival season (with parades running from January through Mardi Gras Day on February 25) coincided with increasing spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States as part of what was then classified as a global epidemic. At the time, scrutiny over large public gatherings had yet to emerge, while scrutiny over international travel primarily placed an emphasis on restricting travel from China—the country from which the disease originated. The first case of COVID-19 in Louisiana was reported on March 9, two weeks after the end of Mardi Gras.
Subsequently, the state of Louisiana saw a significant impact from the pandemic, with New Orleans in particular seeing a high rate of cases. Louisiana State University (LSU) associate professor Susanne Straif-Bourgeoi suggested that the rapid spread may have been aided by Mardi Gras festivities. Researchers of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette determined that Louisiana had the fastest growth rate of cases (67.8%, overtaking New York's 66.1% growth) in the 14 days since its first reported case than any region in the entire world.

Mayor LaToya Cantrell stated that she would have cancelled Mardi Gras festivities had she been provided with sufficient warning by the federal government, and criticized the Trump administration for downplaying the threat. Amid continued spread of COVID-19 across the country, in early-November 2020 Cantrell stated that celebrations in 2021 would have to be ""something different"", as Mardi Gras could not be canceled outright since it is a religious observance. A sub-committee of the Mardi Gras Advisory Committee focused on COVID-19 proposed that parades still be held but with strict safety protocols and recommendations, including enforcement of social distancing, highly recommending the wearing of face masks by attendees, discouraging ""high value"" throws in order to discourage crowding, as well as discouraging the consumption of alcohol, and encouraging more media coverage of parades to allow at-home viewing.
On November 17, 2020, Mayor Cantrell's communications director Beau Tidwell announced that the city would prohibit parades during Carnival season in 2021. Tidwell once again stressed that Mardi Gras was not ""cancelled"", but that it would have to be conducted safely, and that allowing parades was not ""responsible"" as they can be superspreading events. This marked the first large-scale cancellation of Mardi Gras parades since the 1979 police strike. Other krewes subsequently announced that they would cancel their in-person balls, including Endymion and Rex (who therefore did not name a King and Queen of Mardi Gras for the first time since World War II). 
Socially-distanced festivities were established by residents, including ""house floats""–a trend of decorating homes in the style of parade floats. A Facebook group known as the ""Krewe of House Floats"" shared photos of the homes and provided maps, recording participation in the movement in both New Orleans and abroad, including at least one in Australia.
On February 5, 2021, in response to continued concerns surrounding ""recent large crowds in the Quarter"" and variants of SARS-CoV-2 as Shrove Tuesday neared, Mayor Cantrell ordered all bars in New Orleans (including those with temporary permits to operate as restaurants)  to close from February 12 through February 16 (Mardi Gras), and prohibited to-go drink sales by restaurants, and all packaged liquor sales in the French Quarter. To discourage gatherings, pedestrian access to Bourbon Street, Decatur Street, Frenchmen Street between 7:00 p.m. and 3:00 a.m., and Claiborne Avenue under the bridge, was restricted by checkpoints to those accessing businesses and homes within the areas. Mayor Cantrell stated that she would ""rather be accused of doing too much than doing too little."" The move caught some establishments off-guard, as they had been preparing for and anticipating business on Mardi Gras.
Parades were allowed to return for 2022. In December 2021, the city announced that parades would have modified routes in 2022 due to New Orleans Police Department staffing shortages. On January 6, 2022, Mayor Cantrell stated during a kickoff event that ""without a doubt, we will have Mardi Gras in 2022"", citing high COVID-19 vaccination rates, and customarily asked residents to ""do everything that we know is necessary to keep our people safe."" The Krewe de Jeanne D'Arc ceremonially led their parade with a group of marchers with brooms wearing plague doctor outfits, tasked to ""sweep the plague away"".
The city announced COVID-19 protocols for Mardi Gras 2022 in February 2022, which requires, at a minimum, all participants in a parade (including marchers, performers, and those a riding a float) to present proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test from within the past 72 hours. Some krewes chose to not accept negative tests at all, while some krewes (such as the Krewe of Muses, which also announced plans to have COVID-19 rapid tests as throws) had already announced vaccination requirements for parade participants ahead of the official requirement. Despite the presence of Omicron variant, city health director Jennifer Avegno stated that she was confident Mardi Gras could be conducted in a more normal fashion over 2021.

Traditional colors
The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are purple, green, and gold. The colors were first specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their inaugural parade in 1872, suggesting that balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is unknown why these specific colors were chosen; some accounts suggest that they were initially selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true symbolism. Each color also has meaningful representation: purple for justice, green for faith, and gold for power. 
Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892, the Rex organization retroactively declared that the three colors in that order symbolized justice, power, and faith. Mardi Gras historian and WYES-TV Rex ball co-host Errol Laborde presented a theory that the colors were based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and Rex's goal may have been to create a tricolor to represent their ""kingdom"". Purple was widely associated with royalty, while white was already heavily used on other national flags, and was thus avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a flag in green, gold and purple in that order complies with the rule of tincture, which states that metals (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next to other colors, and that colors cannot be placed on or next to other colors. The traditional colors are commonly addressed as purple, green, and gold, in that order—even though this order technically violates the rule of tincture.

Contemporary Mardi Gras
Epiphany
Epiphany on January 6, has been recognized as the start of the New Orleans Carnival season since at least 1900; locally, it is sometimes known as Twelfth Night although this term properly refers to Epiphany Eve, January 5, the evening of the twelfth day of Christmastide. The Twelfth Night Revelers, New Orleans' second-oldest Krewe, have staged a parade and masked ball on this date since 1870. A number of other groups such as the Phunny Phorty Phellows, La Société Pas Si Secrète Des Champs-Élysées and the Krewe de Jeanne D'Arc have more recently begun to stage events on Epiphany as well.
Many of Carnival's oldest societies, such as the Independent Strikers' Society, hold masked balls but no longer parade in public.
Mardi Gras season continues through Shrove Tuesday or Fat Tuesday.

Days leading up to Mardi Gras Day
A 2020 study estimated that Mardi Gras brings 1.4 million visitors to New Orleans.
Wednesday night begins with Druids, and is followed by Alla.
Thursday night starts off with The Knights of Babylon, and then another all-women's parade featuring the Krewe of Muses. The parade is relatively new, but its membership has tripled since its start in 2001. It is popular for its throws (highly sought-after decorated shoes and other trinkets) and themes poking fun at politicians and celebrities.
Friday night is the occasion of the large Krewe of Hermes and satirical Krewe D'État parades, ending with one of the fastest-growing krewes, the Krewe of Morpheus. There are several smaller neighborhood parades like the Krewe of Barkus and the Krewe of OAK.
Several daytime parades roll on Saturday (including Krewe of Tucks and Krewe of Iris) and on Sunday (Thoth, Okeanos, and Krewe of Mid-City).
The first of the ""super krewes"", Endymion, parades on Saturday night, with the celebrity-led Bacchus parade on Sunday night.

Mardi Gras Day
The celebrations begin early on Mardi Gras Day, which can fall on any Tuesday between February 3 and March 9 (depending on the date of Easter, and thus of Ash Wednesday).
In New Orleans, the Zulu parade rolls first, starting at 8:00 a.m. on the corner of Jackson and Claiborne and ending at Broad and Orleans, Rex follows Zulu as it turns onto St. Charles following the traditional Uptown route from Napoleon to St. Charles and then to Canal St. Truck parades follow Rex and often have hundreds of floats blowing loud horns, with entire families riding and throwing much more than just the traditional beads and doubloons. Numerous smaller parades and walking clubs also parade around the city. The Jefferson City Buzzards, the Lyons Club, the Irish Channel Corner Club, Pete Fountain's Half Fast Walking Club and the KOE all start early in the day Uptown and make their way to the French Quarter with at least one jazz band. At the other end of the old city, the Society of Saint Anne journeys from the Bywater through Marigny and the French Quarter to meet Rex on Canal Street. The Pair-O-Dice Tumblers rambles from bar to bar in Marigny and the French Quarter from noon to dusk. Various groups of Mardi Gras Indians, divided into uptown and downtown tribes, parade in their finery.
For upcoming Mardi Gras Dates through the year 2100 see Mardi Gras Dates.

Costumes and masks
In New Orleans, costumes and masks are seldom publicly worn by non-Krewe members on the days before Fat Tuesday (other than at parties), but are frequently worn on Mardi Gras. Laws against concealing one's identity with a mask are suspended for the day. Banks are closed, and some businesses and other places with security concerns (such as convenience stores) post signs asking people to remove their masks before entering.

Throws
A 'throw' is the collective term used for the objects that are thrown from floats to parade-goers. Until the 1960s, the most common form was multi-colored strings of glass beads made in Czechoslovakia.
Glass beads were supplanted by less expensive and more durable plastic beads, first from Hong Kong, then from Taiwan, and more recently from China. Lower-cost beads and toys allow float-riders to purchase greater quantities, and throws have become more numerous and common.
In the 1990s, many people lost interest in small, cheap beads, often leaving them where they landed on the ground. Larger, more elaborate metallic beads and strands with figures of animals, people, or other objects have become the sought-after throws. David Redmond's 2005 film of cultural and economic globalization, Mardi Gras: Made in China, follows the production and distribution of beads from a small factory in Fuzhou, China to the streets of New Orleans during Carnival. The publication of Redmon's book, Beads, Bodies, and Trash: Public Sex, Global Labor, and the Disposability of Mardi Gras, follows up on the documentary by providing an ethnographic analysis of the social harms, the pleasures, and the consequences of the toxicity that Mardi Gras beads produce.
In addition to the toxicity of tons of plastic, eye injuries from Mardi Gras parade throws are commonplace, and more severe injuries—such as a fractured skull in an infant struck by a coconut—have also been known to occur.

Other Mardi Gras traditions
Social clubs
New Orleans Social Clubs or Gentlemen's Clubs play a very large part in the Mardi Gras celebration. The oldest is The Boston Club (third oldest in the United States), founded in 1841 as a place for its members to congregate and partake in the fashionable card game of Boston, Rex Royalty is chosen from among its ranks. The Pickwick Club began as the public face of The Mistick Krewe, but later officially severed ties, still presents debutante balls annually. The Louisiana Club or officially the Louisiana Debating and Literary Association is still the public facade of the Knights of Momus, while the Stratford Club serves as the face of the Order of Mythras.
The two main Mardi Gras parades, Zulu and Rex, are both social club parades. Zulu is a mostly African-American club and Rex is mostly Caucasian. Social clubs host Mardi Gras balls, starting in late January. At these social balls, the queen of the parade (usually a young woman between the ages of 18 and 21, not married and in high school or college) and the king (an older male member of the club) present themselves and their court of maids (young women aged 16 to 21), and different divisions of younger children with small roles in the ball and parade, such as a theme-beformal neighborhood Carnival club ball at local bar room.
After their exclusion from Rex, in 1909 Black Creole and other African American New Orleanians, led by a mutual aid group known as ""The Tramps"", adorned William Storey with a tin can crown and banana stalk scepter and named him King Zulu. This display was meant as a mockery of Rex's overstated pageantry but in time, Zulu became a grand parade in its own right. By 1949, as an indication of Zulu's increase in prestige, the krewe named New Orleans' native son Louis Armstrong as its king.
Being a member of the court requires much preparation, usually months ahead. Women and girls must have dress fittings as early as the May before the parade, as the season of social balls allows little time between each parade. These balls are generally by invitation only. Balls are held at a variety of venues in the city, large and small, depending on the size and budget of the organization. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the French Opera House was a leading venue for New Orleans balls. From the mid 20th century until Hurricane Katrina the Municipal Auditorium was the city's most famous site for Carnival balls. In more recent years, most are at the ballrooms of various hotels throughout the city. The largest ""Super Krewes"" use larger venues; Bacchus the Morial Convention Center and Endymion the Superdome.

Doubloons
One of the many Mardi Gras throws which krewes fling into the crowds, doubloons are large coins, either wood or metal, made in Mardi Gras colors. Artist H. Alvin Sharpe created the modern doubloon for The School of Design (the actual name of the Rex organization). According to the krewe history, in January 1959 Sharpe arrived at the offices of the captain of the krewe with a handful of aluminum discs. Upon entering the office, he threw the doubloons into the captain's face to prove that they would be safe to throw from the floats. Standard krewe doubloons usually portray the Krewe's emblem, name, and founding date on one side, and the theme and year of the parade and ball on the other side. Royalty and members of the court may throw specialty doubloons, such as the special Riding Lieutenant doubloons given out by men on horseback in the Rex parade. In the last decade, krewes have minted doubloons specific to each float. Krewes also mint special doubloons of cloisonné or pure silver for its members. They never throw these from the floats. Original Rex doubloons are valuable, but it is nearly impossible for aficionados to find a certified original doubloon. The School of Design did not begin dating their doubloons until a few years after their introduction.

Flambeau carriers
The flambeau (pronounced ""flahm-bo"", meaning flame-torch) carrier originally, before electric lighting, served as a beacon for New Orleans parade goers to better enjoy the spectacle of night parades. The first flambeau carriers were slaves. Today, the flambeaux are a connection to the New Orleans version of Carnival and a valued contribution. Many people view flambeau-carrying as a kind of performance art – a valid assessment given the wild gyrations and flourishes displayed by experienced flambeau carriers in a parade. Many individuals are descended from a long line of carriers. Parades that commonly feature flambeaux include Babylon, Bacchus, Chaos, Le Krewe d'Etat, Druids, Endymion, Hermes, Krewe of Muses, Krewe of Orpheus, Krewe of Proteus, Saturn, and Sparta. Flambeaux are powered by naphtha, a highly flammable aromatic. It is a tradition, when the flambeau carriers pass by during a parade, to toss quarters to them in thanks for carrying the lights of Carnival. In the 21st century, though, handing dollar bills is common.

Rex
Rex was formed to create a daytime spectacle not only for the residents of the city but for special guest Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia. The Rex motto is, ""Pro Bono Publico—for the public good.""

New Orleans Zulu or Mardi Gras Coconut
One of the most famous and the most sought after throws, is the Zulu Coconut also known as the Golden Nugget and the Mardi Gras Coconut. The coconut is mentioned as far back as 1910, where they were given in a natural ""hairy"" state. The coconut was thrown as a cheap alternative, especially in 1910 when the bead throws were made of glass. Before the Krewe of Zulu threw coconuts, they threw walnuts that were painted gold. This is where the name ""Golden Nugget"" originally came from. It is thought that Zulu switched from walnuts to coconuts in the early 1920s when a local painter, Lloyd Lucus, started to paint coconuts. Most of the coconuts have two decorations. The first is painted gold with added glitter, and the second is painted like the famous black Zulu faces. In 1988, the city forbade Zulu from throwing coconuts due to the risk of injury; they are now handed to onlookers rather than thrown. In the year 2000, a local electronics engineer, Willie Clark, introduced an upgraded version of the classic, naming them Mardi Gras Coconuts. These new coconuts were first used by the club in 2002, giving the souvenirs to royalty and city notables.

Ojen liqueur
Aguardiente de Ojén (es), or simply ""ojen"" (""OH-hen"") as it is known in English, is a Spanish anisette traditionally consumed during the New Orleans Mardi Gras festivities. In Ojén, the original Spanish town where it is produced, production stopped for years, but it started again in early 2014 by means of the distillery company Dominique Mertens Impex. S.L.

House floats
In 2021 due to the cancellation of parades due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the practice of decorating homes in the style of parade floats emerged as an alternative, dubbed ""home floats"" or ""house floats"". The concept was popularized immediately after the announcement that in-person parades would be prohibited, stemming from a post on Twitter by Megan Boudreaux. She later established a formal ""Krewe of House Floats"", with participants being listed in an interactive map on its website so local residents can tour them. The revised celebration was nicknamed ""Yardi Gras"" by residents. Even the dog parade, held by the Mystic Krewe of Mardi Paws in Covington, opted to make ""dog house floats' in 2021.

Public nudity
Wearing less clothing than considered decent in other contexts during Mardi Gras has been documented since 1889, when the Times-Democrat decried the ""degree of immodesty exhibited by nearly all female masqueraders seen on the streets."" Risqué costumes, including body painting, are fairly common. The practice of exposing female breasts in exchange for Mardi Gras beads, however, was mostly limited to tourists in the upper Bourbon Street area. In the crowded streets of the French Quarter, generally avoided by locals on Mardi Gras Day, flashers on balconies cause crowds to form on the streets.
In the last decades of the 20th century, the rise in producing commercial videotapes catering to voyeurs helped encourage a tradition of women baring their breasts in exchange for beads and trinkets. Social scientists studying ""ritual disrobement"" found, at Mardi Gras 1991, 1,200 instances of body-baring in exchange for beads or other favors.

Shelton Freedom Award, the latter named after the locally revered Decatur Daily publisher whose family still controls the newspaper, as well as one of North Alabama's largest aerial fireworks displays.

History
The Spirit of America Festival began in 1967 in response to the growth of anti-Vietnam War protests throughout the United States. The largely conservative citizens of Decatur decided to show their support for the servicemen and servicewomen in Vietnam and to promote patriotism among citizens by presenting an annual Fourth of July event.
Over 10,000 people gathered at Ogle Stadium, a football field at Decatur High School, for the first Spirit of America Festival. By the early 1970s, it was held at Delano Park, a municipal facility located across the street from Decatur High.
In 1970, a Miss America and Miss Alabama preliminary pageant was added to the festival's lineup, Miss Spirit of America, along with family games, musical performances, and other special events. In 1976, the Spirit of America Festival relocated, in time for the U.S. Bicentennial that year, after an outdoor stage was constructed at Point Mallard Park, owned and operated by the City of Decatur since 1970 and a tourist attraction in its own right, adding further appeal to visitors from outside the area. The pageant title was changed to ""Miss Point Mallard"" from 1976 through 2013. In 2014, the pageant moved for its final years to the Princess Theatre Center for the Performing Arts in downtown Decatur and resumed the ""Miss Spirit of America"" name. Due to declining interest in beauty pageants throughout America, the event was discontinued in the late 2010s.
Air Force Captain Gerald O. Young, in his first speech given since receiving the Medal of Honor for heroism in Vietnam, directed a great tribute to the ""American Soldier"" to a gathering of over 20,000 people.
In 1984, President Ronald Reagan, then seeking reelection, addressed a crowd of over 60,000 people at that year's festival. At the time, the City of Decatur only had between 40,000 and 50,000 residents, meaning there were more people who attended the presidential speech than actually lived in the city.
COVID-19 pandemic concerns caused the entirety of the 2020 Festival, even the fireworks display, to be canceled; the 54th Festival took place in 2021, with safety measures in place.

Special Events
The Audie Murphy Patriotism Award is named in honor of America's most decorated soldier from World War II, and Medal of Honor recipient, Audie Murphy. Murphy, who was scheduled to be the guest speaker at the 1971 Spirit of America Festival, died in a plane crash just two months prior to the Festival. The award is now presented annually to an ""outstanding American patriot"" or ""an outstanding group of individuals who most exemplify the true 'Spirit of America.'""
Past recipients of the Audie Murphy Patriotism Award include Vietnam Prisoner of War Charles J. Plumb, Brigadier General Hallett D. Edson, General Omar Bradley, Alabama Governor George C. Wallace, U.S. Senator James B. Allen, U.S. Senator John Sparkman, U.S. astronaut John Young, Olympic track star Jesse Owens (a native of neighboring Lawrence County, Alabama), entertainer Johnny Cash, U.S. Representative Bob Jones, Secretary of State Alexander Haig, Vietnam veteran and U.S. Senator Jeremiah A. Denton, U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, Iranian hostage Charles C. Scott, actor Gerald McRaney, and U.S. Admiral Donald Whitmire.
The Barrett C. Shelton Freedom Award was established in 1980 in honor of local newspaper publisher Barrett C. Shelton, Sr., one of the founders of the Festival. The award is presented annually to honor an Alabamian for outstanding service to his or her community and state. Notable past recipients of the Shelton Award include Henry Eugene ""Red"" Erwin, U.S. Senator Howell Heflin, and U.S. Representative Ronnie Flippo.
In 1994, the H.J. Heimlich Humanitarian Award was added to the honors presented at the Spirit of America Festival. The plaque is presented to an individual or group who has saved or attempted to save another human being's life, or an individual or group who has significantly added to the betterment of all people. Dr. H.J. Heimlich was the first recipient, followed by the United Service Organizations.
The ""Miss Spirit of America"" pageant (known as ""Miss Point Mallard"" from 1976 through 2013) was one of the many preliminary pageants in the Miss America scholarship program. The winner of the pageant advanced to the Miss Alabama pageant, along with receiving a variety of scholarship opportunities, gift certificates, and prizes.
An amateur golf tournament also bears the Spirit of America name and is loosely tied with the annual proceedings. However, the tournament is conducted at a country club in far southeastern Decatur, near Priceville, not at the Point Mallard public golf course.

The event also offered opportunities for private investment in projects, as well as speakers, music, and entertainment. The event launched in 2013.

History
Development
One Spark was conceived in 2011 by Elton Rivas, Dennis Eusebio, and Varick Rosete, three young professionals involved in Jacksonville's start up scene. Inspired by Brad Feld's book Startup Communities, Rivas wanted to develop Jacksonville's start up culture rather than moving elsewhere. The organizers modelled One Spark after events like ArtPrize and South by Southwest, planning a festival where inventors, entrepreneurs, and artists could present their projects, with attendees voting on which ones would receive the prize money.
The project gained momentum when the organizers of a similar proposed event, an arts festival to be called the Epoch Project, suspended operations in June 2012 due to lack of funds and endorsed One Spark. One Spark achieved its goal of $300,000 in private donations in August 2012, and was able to hire a full-time staff to organize the event. By October, they had secured sponsors for $250,000 in prize money, and raised $90,000 to underwrite event costs via Kickstarter. The primary financial backer was former Disney and St. Joe Company executive Peter Rummell, who contributed $750,000 to the project.

Events
The first One Spark was held from April 17–21, 2013, and featured the work of about 900 ""creators"", which were displayed in venues across Downtown Jacksonville. The festival attracted an estimated crowd of 130,000 over five days. For 2014, the festival increased the payout, adding juried prizes and bonus awards to the crowdfunded amount. Additionally, a group of investors led by Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan pledged an amount up to $3.25 million in private investments in individual projects. The event ran from April 9–13, 2014.
Founders Rivas, Eusebio and Rosete served on One Spark's board of directors. Jacksonville marketing executive Joe Sampson replaced Rivas as executive director in 2013.

One Spark 2013
One Spark's inaugural event was held from April 9–13, 2014 had 130,000 attendees, 59 venues, 900 creators with 406 participating creator projects, 553 trained volunteers, and over 53,000 unique votes distributing the $250,000 crowdfund. Creators had access to this crowdfund by receiving votes from the festival visitors.
The festival was held in downtown Jacksonville, Florida, from April 17–21, 2013. The event featured pitch decks, where successful entrepreneurs shared their experience, music stages, food and beer villages.
Winners are...

One Spark 2014
One Spark's second event was held April 9–13, 2014 and had an attendance of 260,000 people with 610 creators. 120,493 votes were cast distributing $310,000.

One Spark Berlin
In 2014, the festival's organizers announced a second event, One Spark START: Berlin, would be held from September 12–13, 2014 in Berlin's Mitte area. Former Jacksonville resident Travis Todd serves as managing director. Unlike the Jacksonville event's street festival atmosphere, One Spark Berlin is a contained location event at the PLATOON KUNSTHALLE.

One Spark 2015
One Spark's third event was held April 7–12, 2015 in downtown Jacksonville. It holds the record for highest attendance for a One Spark event at over 320,000. One Spark claims it was the world's largest crowdfunding event.

One Spark 2016
Organizers retooled One Spark for 2016, held April 6–7. For financial reasons, the event was shortened to two days; prizes were reduced and the contributor list shrank. The street festival portion of the event was combined with Downtown Jacksonville's monthly Art Walk into a joint ""Spark Walk"" on Wednesday, April 6. Thursday, April 7 featured a One Spark Innovation Day convention, including speakers on creator development and venture capital topics, and a ""Spark Tank"" event, where judges ranked the creators. One Spark estimated an attendance of 70,000 for Spark Walk.

One Spark 2017
At a press conference at EverBank Field on June 19, 2017, Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry and One Spark organizers announced that the 2017 festival would be held at U.S. Assure Club West at EverBank Field on October 6–7, with a concert held at Daily's Place on October 5. Bold Events will host up to 150 creators in five Spark Zones. Tickets will cost $5 to pre-register, and $10 on the day of the festival.  However, due to the arrival of Hurricane Irma and the subsequent clean-up and restoration efforts, this has since been postponed, making 2017 the first year since its debut in which a One Spark festival was not hosted. The next One Spark festival was scheduled for April 6–7, 2018.

Event structure
One Spark is a multi-day event where creators, artists, entrepreneurs, and innovators can display projects in a multi-venue gallery in downtown Jacksonville. One Spark objective is to connect people with great ideas to the resources they need to make them a reality. It's a community behind great ideas.
One Spark is open to everyone. Creator projects can be at any stage of development. The event is built on the premise that great creations can come from garages, small studios, and dorm rooms and that the only thing that separates them from the big dogs is access to capital and resources. The selection process for One Spark is completely independent. In 2013, 2014, and 2015 Jacksonville events, venues select which Creators showcase in their spaces and attendees decide who gets funded. Showcasing at One Spark gives you access to thousands of dollars in crowdfunds and awards, millions in potential capital investments, and direct individual contributions from all the visitors. Beginning for One Spark 2015, a jury committee made up of subject matter experts and industry thought-leaders, sponsors and investors will select Creators for participation in each District.
The festival provides the perfect platform to put any idea in front of thousands of people, validate it and receive valuable feedback. As an attendee, people have the opportunity to witness the latest innovations and the power to make them a reality by casting votes towards their favourite project.

Prizes
In addition to the direct contributions by attendees to creators, from 2013 to 2015, One Spark provided additional prize money to creators, including a centralized crowdfund, juried prizes, and direct investment opportunities.

Creators have been able raise money in four different ways:

Wowing attendees and collecting votes to score a piece of the crowdfund. Whatever percentage of the vote a project receives, that's how much of the crowdfund they earn.
Attendees can contribute directly to projects in any dollar amount.
Industry experts will jury an additional prize money to innovative projects in each category. The top vote getters in each category will also get the opportunity to get additional bonus prizes.
Millions in potential capital investments from investors attending the festival looking for new opportunities.

Creator projects
The essence of the event are the Creator projects. People can visit Creators as they demonstrate their ideas in Venues located throughout downtown Jacksonville. People can contribute to the ones they want to see funded.
Creators are people with ideas in art, innovation, music, science, and technology that turn them into Projects to showcase at the festival. A Project is a specific plan, design or undertaking with a clear end. A Project can be at any stage of development but will eventually be completed, and something will be produced as a result.

Pitch Decks
Pitch Decks are platform for Creators to reach a large audience and communicate their ideas in a short period of time. Creators are scheduled to take on the stage and pitch their Projects to a larger audience. This helps promote their idea and increase their chance of getting funded.

Entertainment, food and beer
The event features first-rate entertainment all day and well into the night. Attendees can also visit Food Villages featuring exclusive tastes from some of the city's best chefs and favourite food trucks. There is also a Beer Village where visitors can get locally crafted beer.

One Spark After Dark
Creators and attendees have the opportunity to network and enjoy in local pubs, bars, and special VIP Lounges. Parties and live entertainment are all around.

For Kids
This event is designed for everyone. Families can bring their kids and let them experience innovation first-hand and enjoy plenty of kid-centric programming. There are different activities programmed every day to create a more engaging experience for the little ones of the family. Activities will be published during the month of March.

History
1970s
The festival was first held on Father's Day in 1975. Deacon Maccubbin, owner of the LGBT bookstore Lambda Rising, organized the city's first annual gay pride event. It was a one-day community block party held on 20th Street NW between R and S Streets NW in Washington, D.C. (the same block where Lambda Rising was then located). Two vending trucks, one loaded with beer and another with soft drinks, served the crowd. About 2,000 people attended and visited about a dozen organizational booths and vendors. In a surprising political move indicative of the growing political power of gays and lesbians in the city, several candidates for the D.C. City Council also attended and shook hands for several hours.
In 1981, Gay Pride Day first hosted a parade in addition to the street festival. The growing festival drew more than 10,000 attendees that year. Washington Mayor Marion Barry, elected the previous November, attended his first Gay Pride Day in 1979—and would for the rest of his time in office as mayor.

1980s
Following the 1979 event, with crowds growing larger than could be accommodated at the original location, Maccubbin turned the planning of the event over to a new non-profit group, The P Street Festival Committee, formed in 1980 to take over the growing event. The committee established a board of directors to oversee planning and administer the festival's finances, and widened planning and participation to include a number of prominent LGBT organizations in the D.C. metro area.  Gay Pride Day (as the festival was then known) moved that year to Francis Junior High School at 24th and N Streets NW, next to Rock Creek Park. In 1981, a parade route had also been established. The parade began at 16th Street NW and Meridian Hill Park, traveled along Columbia Road NW and then Connecticut Avenue NW, and ended at Dupont Circle.
1983 was the year the first woman and person of color was named Grand Marshal of the Gay Pride Day parade. In 1984, festival organizers began bestowing the ""Heroes of Pride"" award to members of racial and ethnic minorities who made a difference in their communities.
Attendance at Gay Pride Day events reached 11,000 people in 1981, 15,000 in 1982, and 20,000 in 1983. By 1984, the one-day festival had become a week-long series of meetings, speeches, dances, art exhibits, and parties. At its 10th anniversary in 1985, D.C. Gay Pride Day drew an estimated 28,000 attendees to the street festival and parade. But attendance began varying dramatically from year to year in the late 1980s. In 1986, only about 7,000 people watched the parade, and another 1,000 stayed for events at Francis Junior High. A year later, attendance was estimated variously between 7,000 and 10,000 people.

1990s
Financial problems and growing concerns about the organization's lack of inclusiveness led the P Street Festival Committee to disband in 1990 in favor of a successor organization, Pride of Washington.
Several changes to the event occurred in 1991. The District of Columbia's African American gay community sponsored the first ""Black Lesbian and Gay Pride Day"" on May 25, 1991. The event was created not as a competitor to the June gay pride event but rather as a way of enhancing the visibility of the African American gay and lesbian community. 1991 also saw the Gay Pride Day parade and festival move away from its traditional date for the first time.  Organizers shifted the event to the week prior to Father's Day to give people a chance to spend the holiday with their families. 1991 was also the year that the street festival expanded to more than 200 booths, and the first year that active-duty and retired American military personnel marched in the parade. The parade made national headlines when U.S. Air Force Captain Greg Greeley, who led the active-duty group, was later questioned by military security officers and told his pending discharge was on hold because of his participation in Gay Pride day. No further action against Greeley was taken, and he eventually received an honorable discharge.
The festival suffered from financial difficulties in the early 1990s. Rain during the parade and street festival significantly reduced attendance several years in a row. Unfortunately, festival organizers had decided, as a cost-saving move, to not take out weather cancellation insurance. The festival lost significant amounts of money, and came close to bankruptcy.

In 1995, One In Ten, a D.C.-based arts organization which hosted the Reel Affirmations film festival, assumed responsibility for organizing Gay Pride Day events. One In Ten moved the street festival from Francis Junior High to Freedom Plaza near the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue NW.  The parade route also changed. Instead of traveling westward from Dupont Circle on P Street NW to finish at Francis Junior High School, the parade now began at the school, moved east along P Street to 14th Street NW, and then traveled south on 14th Street NW to Freedom Plaza.
The change in sponsorship and significant organizational and promotional changes led to sharply higher attendance.  The parade and festival drew only about 25,000 attendees in 1994, but this soared to more than 100,000 by 1996.
However, the financial and organizational strain of producing the event proved too heavy for the small arts group. In 1997, Whitman-Walker Clinic joined One In Ten as a co-sponsor of the festival, and the event was renamed Capital Pride. The street festival was moved off Freedom Plaza and onto Pennsylvania Avenue NW between 14th and 10th Streets NW. Corporate sponsorships also rose dramatically, reflecting the festival's growing commercial nature. Corporate sponsorships reached $247,000 in 1999, up from $80,000 in 1998.  1997 also saw the city's first Youth Pride Day event.  Sponsored by the Youth Pride Alliance, an umbrella group of LGBT organizations supporting the sexual orientation and gender expression needs of young people, the event was held first held in late April (although after 2010 it moved to a date closer to Capital Pride).

2000s
Whitman-Walker Clinic became the sole sponsor of Capital Pride in 2000.  The festival was moved to Pennsylvania Avenue NW between 4th and 7th Streets NW, and the festival's main stage repositioned so that the United States Capitol building was in the background. As a cost-saving move, in 2002 the parade was moved to early evening on Saturday while the festival continued to occur on Sunday afternoon. The same year, the number of parade contingents reached 200 for the first time. In 2004, 100,000 people attended Capital Pride events.
But financial problems once more plagued Capital Pride.  The event had come to be billed as a fund-raiser for the clinic, although net revenues were also shared with other organizations. In July 2005 (after Capital Pride was over), Whitman-Walker Clinic revealed that it had asked the Human Rights Campaign, a national gay rights advocacy group, for an emergency donation of $30,000. The clinic had also asked D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams to waive more than $40,000 in street closing and police overtime fees.  Both requests were granted.  Unnamed sources quoted by the Washington Blade, a local LGBT newspaper, said Whitman-Walker's financial problems had spilled over into Capital Pride planning.  Had the financial help not been forthcoming, the 2005 festival would have been significantly curtailed.  Whitman-Walker officials strongly disputed the claims about the organization's finances, but did not deny that the financial requests had been made. WWC estimated the day after the festival ended that net proceeds from Capital Pride were $30,000 in 2005.
A week after the financial problems were revealed, Robert York, the Whitman-Walker staffer who had served as executive director of Capital Pride since 1999, unexpectedly resigned from the Clinic and as Capital Pride organizer.  York's departure followed a series of resignations by the clinic's upper- and middle-level managers. York was replaced by clinic staff member David Mallory.

Financial difficulties at Whitman-Walker Clinic led to speculation that the healthcare organization would spin off Capital Pride as an independent body or permit another group to take it over. The Washington Blade quoted unnamed Whitman-Walker staffers as saying that Capital Pride consumed a significant amount of the clinic's time, resources, and staff but did not generate large revenues in return. In April 2005, The Center, an LGBT organization attempting to build a gay and lesbian community center in the District of Columbia, approached Whitman-Walker officials and asked if they would turn Capital Pride over to them. Whitman-Walker refused the offer, citing The Center's own financial difficulties and small staff.
The financial distress and staff changes did not appear to change the event's appeal, however. Capital Pride attracted more than 200,000 people in 2006, making it the fourth-largest gay pride event in the United States. The festival included four major dance parties, a youth prom, and a transgender dinner. D.C. Leather Pride held its first events in 2006 as well, which included a Mr. and Ms. Capital Pride Leather competition.
Whitman-Walker expanded organizational oversight of Capital Pride in 2007.  Although the healthcare organization remained the sole sponsor of the festival, 11 other local non-profit organizations joined with WWC to form the Capital Pride Planning Committee.  This committee contributed staff and organizational resources to help produce the event. 2007 also saw the city's first Trans Pride. Organized by the D.C. Trans Coalition, an umbrella group of organizations and activists supporting the needs of transgender people, the addition of Trans Pride to Capital Pride was a direct outcome of the expanded organizational planning group. D.C. Latino Pride also held its first events in 2007 as well. Hosted by the Latino LGBT History Project, it featured an exhibit and panel discussion (which has led some to date the founding of D.C. Latino Pride to 2007's expanded events rather than 2006).
But the financial pressures on Whitman-Walker did not abate. With the clinic itself under significant financial pressure, WWC issued a Request for Proposal in the second week of January 2008 asking for one or more groups to replace WWC as the organizer and sponsor of Capital Pride. On January 11, 2008, Whitman-Walker Clinic disclosed, for the first time in years, the financial status of Capital Pride. WWC revealed that the 2007 Capital Pride festival ran a deficit of $32,795 on $167,103 in revenue. The clinic also reported that this included reimbursing itself for $100,000 in ""up-front money"" to pay for festival-related expenses occurred far in advance of the festival. Twelve other local organizations were also reimbursed $28,000 in up-front money as well.
In March 2008, Whitman-Walker Clinic awarded the production rights to Capital Pride to the Capital Pride Alliance—a group of volunteers and organizations formed by members of the Capital Pride Planning Committee.  Capital Pride Alliance won the bid over The Center, Westminster Presbyterian Church, and Jansi LLC (the parent company of the local LGBT newsweekly, Metro Weekly). WWC last helped to produce Capital Pride in 2008.
Capital Pride Alliance was the sole producer of the event beginning in 2009.

2010s
The 35th anniversary of Capital Pride occurred in 2010.  Organizers and affiliate organizations hosted 60 events over 10 days. According to organizers, a record attendance of more than 250,000 people turned out just for the Pride street festival.
Capital Pride continued to flourish over the next several years.  Per policy, city officials and police declined to provide a crowd estimate in 2011, but event organizers said 200,000 to 250,000 people attended both the parade and the street festival. In 2012, the Capital Pride parade extended for more than 1.5 miles (2.4 km), and was expected to draw about 100,000 spectators. Although about 200,000 attendees were expected at the street festival the next day, organizers put actual attendance at about 250,000. More than 300 vendors participated in the street fest, and D.C. Latino Pride expanded to four days of events.
A contingent from the Washington National Cathedral marched in the Capital Pride parade for the first time in 2013. Leading the group of 30 staffers was the Very Reverend Gary Hall, Dean of the cathedral. The Washington Post described the cathedral group's participant as ""a stunner for some"". The Washington Blade reported attendance at the 2013 parade at 100,000. Changes to the parade included a turn north rather than south on 14th Street NW. The street festival started an hour later (noon), and ended an hour later (9:00 P.M.) to take advantage of the summer sunlight hours. A less positive change was a split among organizers of D.C. Latino Pride. A group of 11 organizations questioned the Latino LGBT History Project's control over and use of the event as a fundraising mechanism. They also claimed that transgender groups were being excluded from the event, and it was focused on national issues at the expense of grassroots organizing and community groups. The Latino GLBT History Project strongly denied both claims. The 11 dissenting groups split from the D.C. Latino Pride effort, and both groups of Latino organizations held competing events and parties in early June 2013.

On June 7, 2014, a United States Armed Forces color guard led the way and retired the colors in the Capital Pride parade.  It was the first time in American history that an officially sanctioned United States Armed Forces color guard marched in a gay pride parade. Although several gay pride parade organizers nationwide had requested a color guard since the demise of the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy in 2011, none had ever been approved. The eight-person color guard represented each branch of the United States armed forces. The Military District of Washington provided the color guard, which also presents colors for the President of the United States, members of Congress, and at official state functions. The 2014 parade attracted more than 100,000 people, while festival organizers estimated that more than 250,000 people attended events during the entire week-long Capital Pride celebration.  The 2015 parade drew roughly 150,000 people.
On June 8, 2019, reports of gunfire at the parade in Dupont Circle caused people to flee through the streets in a panic. Police responded to the scene but determined that no shots were fired; the sounds of gunshots were most likely falling crowd-control barriers. A man with a BB gun was arrested for causing the panic and for possession of an illegal weapon; he pointed the BB gun at another person in Dupont Circle who was assaulting his female ""significant other"", according to a police report. Seven people were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries from the stampede.

2020s
No Capital Pride was held in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Washington, D.C., and the event was conducted virtually in 2021. Capital Pride resumed in-person events in 2022, including a parade, and a festival where Vice President Kamala Harris surprised the audience.

Organization
Capital Pride was originally called Gay Pride Day.  It changed its name to Gay and Lesbian Pride Day in 1981, and to Capital Pride in 2000.
The event was initially organized in 1975 by Deacon Maccubbin, owner of Lambda Rising Bookstore, with the help of the bookstore's employees, volunteers, and a part-time executive director, Bob Carpenter.  Maccubbin and Lambda Rising hosted the event for the first five years of its existence, until it grew to 10,000 attendees and spread over three blocks. At that point, it became too large for the space available, so Maccubbin began looking for an alternative location.  In 1980, a group of community activists incorporated as the P Street Festival Committee and Maccubbin turned the event over to that group. Financial problems and growing concerns about the organization's lack of inclusiveness led the committee to disband in 1990 in favor of a successor organization, Pride of Washington.  Further financial problems led Pride of Washington to transfer the event to a local LGBT arts organization, One In Ten, in 1995.  In 1997, One In Ten partnered with Whitman-Walker Clinic to co-produce the festival.  Whitman-Walker Clinic became the sole sponsor in 2000.
Whitman-Walker turned the event over to a new group, the Capital Pride Alliance, in 2008. Capital Pride Alliance has continued to produce festival. Although the Capital Pride Alliance was formed by 11 organizations, it now has a self-perpetuating board of directors.

Cultural references
In 2005, an exhibit at The Warehouse Gallery, an art gallery and museum in the District of Columbia, documented the history and meaning of Capital Pride for area residents.  The exhibit, ""Queering Sight—Queer Insight,"" opened on June 3, 2005, and ran for a month.
In 2006, Capital Pride was featured in the comedy film Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.
One In Ten sponsored a second exhibit about Capital Pride's history in 2007.  The exhibit was installed at The Sumner School, a city-owned museum in a historic former school building in midtown D.C.  The exhibit ran from March to June 2007.
The New York Times in May 2014 called Capital Pride one ""of the more notable Pride festivals and parades around the country"".

Partners, Professionals and Allies
Fantasia Fair has always emphasized and supported the spouses, family members, and allies of transgender and other gender nonconforming people and considered them full partners in the event. Discounts have routinely been given to spouses and every year one or more helping professionals work with trans families, holding workshops in a program track specifically for those in relationships with trans and gender nonbinary people.
Fantasia Fair has always attracted and welcomed helping professionals, many of whom attend for many years. Many of the trans attendees are themselves helping professionals and bring specialized knowledge to the event. Professionals include speech and voice therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, surgeons, academics in a variety of disciplines, and gender theorists.

Events
Fantasia Fair offers ""a myriad of events and activities""  including luncheons, award banquets, daily keynote addresses, and a wealth of workshops on topics including dance, gender change, identity, community building, legal and medical issues, and pronoun usage. Workshops on cosmetics and consultations on hair, makeup, clothing, voice, and gender confirmation surgeries are offered for those who desire them. There is an evening fashion show and a Fantasia Fair Follies talent show, and opportunities for nightlife and outings like whale watching, dunes tours, and history walks. The Unitarian Universalist Meeting House of Provincetown holds a special trans-inclusive service on the last day of Fantasia Fair.
Conference attendees are encouraged to participate in as many activities as possible, but are under no obligation to attend all, or any of the offered events. Many of the events take place in the Crown and Anchor restaurant, bar, and nightclub, but Fantasia Fair encompasses the entire town. Attendees stay in a variety of small inns and bed & breakfast establishments and many rent apartments or houses. Workshops and lunches are held in a variety of locations.

Promotion
In its early years, promotion of Fantasia Fair was, at times, difficult, due to the discriminatory attitude and laws surrounding transsexualism, transvestism, and transgenderism. Promotion was carried out in a number of ways: flyers were sent out, usually in the February before the Fair, which is held in October. Brochures were made available and mailed to homes of past participants, and newsletters were mailed out in April, June, and September. Ads and articles were posted in several publications. Fantasia Fair staff members spoke about the event in their addresses, lectures, and speaking engagements. Orientation lectures and meetings were also used for promotion. There were correspondence periods via mail during the reservation, inquiry, and registration periods, in which participants and potential participants could ask staff members questions. There was also a central bulletin board and message center. During the Fair, advertisements were posted in convenient locations throughout Provincetown. Lastly, one of the most important tools for communication and promotion was word of mouth, including conversations involving facts, rumors, and opinions about the Fair between participants.
Today, the Fantasia Fair maintains a website and a presence on social media. Brochures are distributed throughout the year. A colorful program book is issued to participants upon arrival, and a daily newsletter tracks last-minute changes to the complex schedule.

Accommodations
In its earliest years, Fantasia Fair offered a choice of accommodation from three options: a motel close to the beach, a larger hotel, or small apartments. Accommodation was assigned on a first-come, first-served basis, and prices varied depending on choice of facility. The Boatslip Motor Inn was a motel located close to the beach, and west of Provincetown's downtown. It offered single rooms and an ""excellent view of ocean scenery."" The Crown and Anchor Motor Inn was a larger hotel in which many of the Fair's events took place. It's located in the downtown area on Commercial Street. The Crown and Anchor offered single, double rooms, and suites, all with private bath, as well as several facilities on-site such as a restaurant, a lounge, a dance club, and several small shops. The small apartments were in the Hargood Apartments, whicher were also located in the downtown area. Couples could book an apartment for a reduced rate. All apartments included a kitchenette, a separate bedroom, and a private bath.
Today Fantasia Fair utilizes a number of restaurants and inns and attendees stay in a variety of inns or rent houses or apartments for their week in Provincetown. The banquets and keynotes are held at the Crown and Anchor.

History
1975
Fantasia Fair was founded by individuals such as Betsy Shaw, Ari Kane, Betty Ann Lind, and Linda Franklin, as well as other members of The Cherrystones, a transgender support group based out of Boston. The notion of a transgender conference stemmed from the founders' firm belief that there was a need for trans people of all sorts to learn about themselves, in order to feel less isolated in society because of their gender identity. Once Provincetown was selected as the official location of Fantasia Fair, the founders worked with female impersonators from the Massachusetts town, a few Cape Cod doctors, and some cosmetics consultants in order to establish the first Fantasia Fair. There were approximately 40 participants in the first year.

1976
The annual Fantasia Fair took place from October 15 to October 24 in 1976. Coordinated by Ari Kane, the 2nd annual Fair offered many events. These included fashion and beauty courses, the Ages of Fashion Ball, an awards banquet, a film festival, a fashion show, the Foundation Boutique, a volleyball game, and exhibits and displays. In addition to these events, the 1976 conference was the first to offer a course specifically for the wives and girlfriends of transgender and transsexual participants in the Fair. These seminars were for the purpose of fostering healthy relationships between partners, and for the growth of understanding and support. The 1976 Fair was also the first to offer job opportunities as ""Femmes in Provincetown,"" at frequent requests of participants.

1977
The 3rd annual Fantasia Fair took place from October 15 to 23 in 1977. Each event began at 9:30 every morning and lasted for an hour. Any demonstration was an additional $35 on top of the original fee. The coordinator for the 1977 Fair was Nancy Ledins. Registration for the 9-day-long event started at 2:00 pm on Friday the 15th. Approximately 100 individuals took part in the 1977 Fantasia Fair, and around two-thirds of them stayed for the entire nine-day period. The events in 1977 were similar to those of the 1976 Fantasia Fair. The Fashion Beauty course was offered every morning of the Fair. Paula Nielson was the coordinator of the Fashion and Beauty segment of the Fair. The body movement courses included assistance on the improvement of ""femme comportment"" in walking, talking, sitting, dining, and dancing. On the last Friday of the Fair, a potluck dinner in the Unitarian Church following a symposium on transgenderism and the trans community. In the annual awards ceremony, awards given included best in Congeniality, Best Dressed, and the Cinderella Award. New awards were included as well, including Miss Femininity and Miss Fantasia Fair.

1978
The 4th annual Fantasia Fair took place from October 13 to the 22nd. The coordinator of the 1978 Fantasia Fair was Nancy Ledins. Virginia Prince considered attending the Fair in 1978, and was a frequent attendee in later years.

1999
The dates of the 25th Silver Jubilee Fantasia Fair were October 17 through 24. The Angela Ochoa Best-Dressed and Femininity awards were retired.

2001
At the conclusion of Fantasia Fair 2000, stewardship of Fantasia Fair was transferred from the nonprofit Outreach Institute for Gender Studies to the nonprofit Real Life Experiences. Special events in 2001 included a screening of the film Southern Comfort, an art gallery walk, and high tea and a photo exhibit by Mariette Pathy Allen at the Provincetown Art Association Museum. The dates of the 2001 Fantasia Fair were October 14–21. Dallas Denny was Fair Director.

2002
Fantasia Fair 2001 began on October 20 and ended on October 27 and saw the first Transgender Pioneer awards banquet. Pioneer awards were given to Virginia Prince and Merissa Sherrill Lynn for their decades of work on behalf of the transgender community. Dallas Denny was again Fair Director.

2004
Program Director Miqqi Alicia Gilbert used six keynote slots to create The Trans-Progressive Symposium. Symposium speakers were Susan Stryker, Dallas Denny, Miqqi Alicia Gilbert, Jamison Green, and Miilton Diamond. Keynote presentations were open to the public. On Monday night there was a preview of Stryker's film Screaming Queens: The Riot at Compton's Cafeteria. Dates for the 2004 Fantasia Fair were October 17 through October 24.

2008
The dates of Fantasia Fair 2008 were October 19 through October 26. The Femininity Award was retired.

2015
The 41st annual Fantasia Fair was held from October 18, 2015 to October 25, 2015. The coordinator was Barbara Curry, with help from past Fair directors. Many events remain the same as they were in 1975, such as Awards Banquet, now called The Virginia Prince Transgender Pioneer Awards Banquet, the film festival, the fashion show, as well as the Ball, and the Gala Awards Banquet. The seminars, workshops, and talks have evolved a lot since 1975. Many of the talks and workshops addressed issues surrounding the politics of transgender people, such as hate crimes by the federal government about trans people, self-defense courses, and the issue of gendered washrooms as well as the medical aspect of transition such as workshops addressing the biopsychology of trans people, hormone management, gender change surgical options, post-surgery realities, and hair removal education. Many traditional-style workshops still were offered as well, such as seminars addressing wig styling, feminizing the voice, and makeup and image consultations.
Fantasia Fair Directors have included Nancy Ledins, Ariadne Kane, Betty Ann Lind, Alison Laing, Dottie Laing, Pamela Geddes, Dallas Denny, Miqqi Alicia Gilbert, Barbara Curry, and Jamie Dailey. Dee LaValle was named Fair Director in 2018.

The Human Outreach and Achievement Institute
The Human Outreach and Achievement Institute was established in 1975  in Boston as a way to increase awareness and participation in the Fantasia Fair conference, as well as to function as a support and information centre for members of the Trans Community. The main goal of the nonprofit institute is to develop and foster understanding of human sexuality, in order to combat ignorance and misinformation. Ariadne Kane both founded the institute with help from other individuals such as Sandy Mesics, and directed it for a number of years. The Human Outreach and Achievement Institute helped to develop several programs to achieve their goal of education and training for professionals. These programs included conferences, informational seminars, and workshops. The programs were directed at people from relevant professions in fields such as education, guidance and counseling, therapy, law, law enforcement, nursing, and human services. The Outreach Institute also offered special programs surrounding gender issues and androgyny. Many of the programs are directed at communities of crossdressers, transsexuals, and androgyns. In addition to these programs, the Human Outreach and Achievement Institute published books and pamphlets with information regarding masculinity, transvestism, socio-cultural contexts of crossdressing, and abstracts of symposiums on gender studies and other issues. The first training session for professionals occurred in March 1977. The institute received correspondence from all over the United States, as well as Canada. In 1980, the organization received significant media coverage on a Phil Donahue episode, which was viewed by more than 8 million people, where Ariadne Kane spoke about gender fluidity and took questions from the audience. The Institute also sent out newsletters called Swan which included editorials, letters to the editor, book recommendations, and shopping recommendations specifically for the safety and comfort of trans people. There were also sections on Trans community news, politics, interviews, calls to assist in the Outreach program, as well as special offers and deals specifically for people in the trans community.

Real Life Experiences
Real Life Experiences is a nonprofit 401(c)(4) corporation which was founded in 2000 to serve as the parent nonprofit for Fantasia Fair. At an annual banquet held at Fantasia Fair, RLE presents Virginia Prince Transgender Pioneer Awards to one or more individuals who have worked selflessly on behalf of the transgender and gender nonconforming community.

History
In 1979, John Ramirez and Stuart Timmons, two students at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), founded a gay film festival on campus. By 1982, it had become known as the ""Gay and Lesbian Media Festival and Conference."" The name was changed to Outfest in 1994.
In 1996 Outfest began a relationship with Sundance, another film festival. 
2004 Was the first year the idea of a queer film festival curating around people of color came about. Outfests then executive Stephen Gutwilig and Kirsten Schaffer are the name behind the idea.
In 2005 UCLA Film & Television Archive and Outfest teamed up to save movies and videos made by LGBTQ people. They called this project the Outfest UCLA Legacy Project.  Since, Outfest and UCLA have continued to grow their collection making it one of the biggest attainable resources for moving images. 
In September 2016, Outfest held its first traveling film festival in Northampton, Massachusetts, at the Academy of Music Theatre.
The 2018 Outfest film festival was held at the Directors Guild of America in Los Angeles, California. In 2019 the executives of the Outfest film festival decided it was time for a change in location once the Directors Guild of America began renovating. The TCL Chinese Theater also in LA, then became the new home for Outfest film festival.
In June 2020, Outfest partnered with Film Independent to launch the United in Pride digital film festival. Outfest was also one of the key partners, alongside the Frameline Film Festival, the New York Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, & Transgender Film Festival and the Inside Out Film and Video Festival, in launching the North American Queer Festival Alliance, an initiative to further publicize and promote LGBT film.
In January 2022, Outfest celebrated its 26th queer brunch at Sundance.

The main festival took place in Oakland, California, although sibling festivals were also held in New York City, Atlanta and London.

History
The festival was first held in August 2001 (and was known as ""Cypher"") as a part of the East Bay (Oakland) LGBT Pride, following the suggestion of East Bay (Oakland) Pride organizer Pete King. Though King was not a fan of hip hop music or culture, he was familiar with the numerous out queer hip hop artists performing in the San Francisco Bay Area and felt the growing scene was an important component of the LGBT arts community. In June 2001, King approached Juba Kalamka of the group Deep Dickollective about his ideas (including naming the event ""PeaceOUT"") and inquired as to the possibility of organizing the event.
Though at first reticent as a result of what he viewed as racial and class antagonism toward hip hop at mainstream pride events, Kalamka eventually relented, which led to the organization of ""Cypher 2000:One"" by his Deep Dickollective bandmate Tim'm West and London-based DJ Christopher ""Mister Maker"" Harvey, who founded the Gayhiphop.com website in 2000.
The success of the event led to plans to create a larger scale event in 2002. East Bay Pride sponsored the event until its own dissolution after PeaceOUT 2003, at which time main financial sponsorship and organization was coordinated by Kalamka's micro-label Sugartruck Recordings and Matt Wobensmith of the zine and record label Outpunk and later the Queercorps imprint.
Among the performers who appeared at the festival were Deep Dickollective, Katastrophe, Tori Fixx, God-des and She, Deadlee, Jen-Ro, Jaycub Perez, Cazwell and soce, the elemental wizard. Numerous performances from the festival are featured in the documentary film Pick Up the Mic, which premiered at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2005.
Despite initial plans to continue with PeaceOUT as a biannual event following the 2007 festival, Kalamka decided to close the event permanently in July 2008. The official website is currently maintained as a permanent historical archive of the festival.

History
The event traces its beginnings to August 1972 as an end-of-summer party among a group of 40 to 50 friends both straight and gay. They billed their event as ""Southern Decadence Party: Come as Your Favorite Southern Decadent."" People who attended were required to dress as their favorite decadent Southerner. Two weeks later, the group threw another party as a farewell to Michael Evers, who left to join his lover David Randolph in Michigan. The first small ""walking parade"" occurred the following year when the participants first met at Johnny Matassa's Bar in the French Quarter to show off their costumes and then walk back home to Belle Reve, a name taken from A Streetcar Named Desire, in the Tremé neighbourhood via Esplanade Avenue. This first group impersonated people and characters, such as Belle Watling (the prostitute character in Gone with the Wind), Mary Ann Mobley, Tallulah Bankhead, and Helen Keller. The event expanded with Frederick Douglas Wright, an African American, appointed as the first grand marshal  by members of the original group in 1974, who had complete control over the parade of characters and costumes as they marched through the French Quarter.

Characteristics
Decadence, as it is commonly known by participants, is marked by having parades, bead tossing, and having street parties and dance parties. It resembles New Orleans Mardi Gras, but Southern Decadence is sexual in tone. Decadence crowds in the Quarter typically match or exceed Mardi Gras crowds. Most events take place in or around the French Quarter, centered at the intersection of Bourbon and St. Ann streets.
Crowds range from 100,000 to 300,000 revelers from across the world. In 2018, there were over 250,000 participants and the positive economic impact on the City of New Orleans was estimated at over $275 million.
Decadence caters primarily to gay men, but it is lesbian-friendly. Dykes on Bikes and other lesbian groups participate in the annual parade in the French Quarter and GrrlSpot (lesbian party promoter) sponsors a few events for lesbians.

Themes
Themes were presented on and off from the beginning, but themes did not become a consistent fixture of the event until ""Plagues, Pests, Parasites"" theme in 1988. They have been featured every year that the Decadence has been held since then. They have ranged from themes as varied as ""Voodoo That You Do"", ""Menage à Trois"", ""Ancient Truths, Lies, and Sacrifice"", and ""Hurricane: This Year, They Blow Back.""
The theme for 2018 was ""House of Bourbon -- Unleash Your Beast"", and the theme for 2019 was “Fruit Salad: Come Toss a Good Time”.

Opposition
In years past, religious and conservative groups have rallied against the festival. In 2003, there was a formal petition filed to have the event terminated, with video footage handed over to officials depicting dozens of men engaged in ""public sex acts"". There were examples of men exposing themselves to others for beads, similar to the way women have exposed their breasts during the traditional Mardi Gras balcony bead toss. The complaints led to a vocal response from business owners and hoteliers in New Orleans in support of the festival. Ultimately the police posted notices clarifying what constitutes public sex. Grant Storms, the pastor who spearheaded, videotaped, and filed the petition, was arrested in February 2011 after being caught masturbating in a public park. He was convicted of obscenity on August 22, 2012.
The city later passed an ordinance that effectively banned the dissemination of any social, political, or religious message on Bourbon Street from sunset to sunrise, punishable by up to six months in jail and a $500 fine. City Councilwoman Kristin Palmer, who sponsored the ordinance, said the city ""has a legitimate interest in protecting residents and visitors in the highly trafficked area of Bourbon Street at night. She said aggressive solicitation can be a crowd control issue, and people are allowed under the law to speak their messages if they take five steps off Bourbon Street. This is really an issue of trying to protect public safety.""
Nine preachers and activists were arrested on September 1, 2012 after they allegedly yelled slurs at people attending Southern Decadence on Bourbon Street. Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union during the first round of their case, those arrested saw the law temporarily suspended via a restraining order that was granted by a federal judge.
Later the New Orleans City Council voted to lift the 2011 ordinance banning Street Preaching from sunset to sunrise on the city's famous Bourbon Street.
The unconstitutionally of the city restrictions which (prohibited a person or group from gathering on Bourbon Street) ""for the purpose of disseminating any social, political or religious message"" was ""so patently unconstitutional that they could not hope the judge would rule otherwise"", said attorney Nate Kellum  with the Center for Religious Expression.
A 2018 Vice News documentary hosted by Jamali Maddix featured prominent American Christian street preacher Ruben Israel and his Bible Believers group, which publicly protests Southern Decadence. The group often yells slurs at and harasses attendees.

Cancellations
Hurricane Katrina
In the year 2005, that year's edition of Southern Decadence was officially cancelled in the wake of safety precautions against Hurricane Katrina. However, a small group of residents who still remained in the French Quarter celebrated the event anyway. An abbreviated parade took place in the French Quarter with some two dozen participants. Most were French Quarter hold-outs; there were also at least a couple of people who had to wade in through flooded streets from other neighbourhoods to get there. As the city was officially being evacuated at the time, a police officer at first attempted to stop the small observation of tradition, but one of the participants was able to produce the parade permit issued pre-Katrina showing it was a scheduled legal event, and the small procession was allowed to continue. National media reporters noted the event. It was the first parade in New Orleans after the hurricane, the most recent previous New Orleans parade having been the Krewe of OAK ""Midsummer Mardi Gras"" parade the night before the city's mandatory evacuation.
With the theme ""Southern Decadence Rebirth"", the event rebounded in 2006, attracting near-normal crowds.
In 2007, the Bourbon Street Extravaganza, annually hosted by Napoleon's Itch, saw Deborah Cox, Fredrick Ford, Jeanie Tracy and Mat Jordan headline the festival.

Hurricane Gustav
Due to the approach of Hurricane Gustav in 2008 and a mandatory evacuation notice, some events on Saturday and all official Southern Decadence events after Sunday, August 31 midday were cancelled that year. As a result of Sunday's parade being cancelled, the 2008 Southern Decadence Grand Marshals, Paloma (Samson Utley) and Tittie Toulouse (Gary Delaune), returned for 2009. However, as was the case with 2005, a small group of French Quarter residents still celebrated the 2008 event anyway with an ""unofficial"" parade taking place once again in the French Quarter. This parade had some two-dozen participants, just like three years earlier.
With the theme ""Hurricane: This Year, They Blow Back"", the event once again rebounded as a whole in 2009, attracting near-normal crowds.

COVID-19 pandemic
In the year 2020, that year's edition of Southern Decadence was officially cancelled in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The following year's edition was also cancelled in 2021 due to continued concerns surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, plus the effects of Hurricane Ida on South Louisiana.

History
The festival began in 1977 when the Salt Lake Coalition for Human Rights sponsored a three-day conference. Affirmation: LGBTQ Mormons, Families, & Friends (then called Gay Mormons United) was founded during this conference, on June 11. The 1978 keynote speakers were David Kopay, the first NFL player to come out of the closet, and U.S. Air Force Sgt. Leonard Matlovich, an ex-Mormon who was the first openly gay person to appear on the cover of Time magazine.
Utah Pride Inc. was created in 1989 through 2004 as a project of the Gay and Lesbian Community Council of Utah. The project was renamed Pride of Utah in 2006.
The first Pride march in the state was held June 27, 1990 at the state capitol building.  It began on the steps of the capitol, went down Main street, and ended on South Temple at the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art (then the Salt Lake Art Center). It included a procession of 270. In 1991, the Utah Stonewall Center opened and Pride festivities moved to the Salt Lake County Fairgrounds in Murray, Utah. The march attracted twice as many participants along with opposition by members of the Aryan Nation. The Pride Day Art Expo and Competition was created to award local artists with its Lesbian and Gay Pride Art Award and the Mapplethorpe Award.

In 1997, a football field-length pride flag was made to carry down the parade route. It was produced by Rev. Bruce Barton of the Metropolitan Community Church of Salt Lake City, UT along with a dozen helpers (including Bruce Harmon, Jeff Freedman, Carrie Gayler, Lynn Sasaki, Terry Gillman and Garth Snyder) who called it a ""tremendous symbol of pride and unity."" Completed the day of the parade (June 8 at 4:15 am), this 300 foot long flag was composed of 35 bolts of lightweight fabric in six colors. It took more than 80 hours to sew. Over 100 marchers would hold the sides. People often threw donations onto the flag, and children would run around underneath. The first flag bearers were members of the Utah Gay and Lesbian Youth group and some others that did not belong to a community organization. They took it from the Utah State Capitol Building, down State Street, past the LDS Church Office Building, and on to the Salt Lake City and County Building. By 2012, the original flag had seen better days, and a new one from Colonial Flag was purchased for $5,000. It is 30x200 feet and made of nylon, with hand holds every 18 inches. Also, Utah Pride Center gifted Moab Pride their own 100 foot flag.
In 2004, an estimated 50,000 people attended, the largest since the festival began. However, in 2005, the first year in which an admission was charged, attendance at the festival was 15,000 to 20,000. Some have attributed this decline to patrons not wanting to pay for admission to the festival. Festival organizers argued that it was the first year in which an accurate method of counting the attendance was employed and that the numbers did not reflect a drop in attendance.
In 2011 the first local pride festival was held in Moab, Utah.
The 2012 festival included performers Frenchie Davis and Prince Poppycock
In 2013, pride spread to Provo, Utah, with their first pride.
In 2014, Mayor Ralph Becker threw a private wedding reception for couples whose marriages he performed on the first day that same-sex marriage became legal in Utah.
Pride reached Ogden, Utah, in 2015 when they held their first pride festival.
2016 was the first year panel discussions were held during the festival, inside the Salt Lake City Public Library.

2020 saw the festival postponed till September due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but ultimately happened in October, with the First Utah Pride Road Ralley.2021 was restructured as a Pride Week, much like early pride festivals of the early 1990s due to the ongoing wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and issues with ensuring proper health for the populace with vaccinated/unvaccinated peoples. Events included walk through exhibits, online inter-faith, and a march starting near the Utah State Capitol building at 300 North State St., marchers carried the 300 foot rainbow flag and the first balloon arch. The flag and balloon arch marched down State Street and met the next balloon arch, and then the next balloon arch, and the next, until all had joined together to create a massive balloon arch of over 1000 balloons, as the march reached Harvey Milk Boulevard and 600 east at Liberty Park.

They came to resemble underground rave parties in some respects, but differ in that circuit parties are highly publicized and professionally produced, and tend to attract people from a wider age range and a broader geographic area.

Background
Founding as disco parties (1970s)
The start of the circuit has been attributed to many different parties that sprang up during the late 1970s and early 1980s.  These proto-circuit parties in the late 1970s, the precursors of what later became circuit parties, were called disco parties. They lasted one evening only, and were held in various large venues in metropolitan areas with large gay populations.  Although Flamingo and 12 West were Manhattan clubs that had theme-centered gay parties, these nightclubs were eclipsed by the opening of The Saint in the East Village in 1980.
The Saint, which was constructed inside the renovated space that had once housed the renowned Fillmore East theatre, featured a dome-covered dance floor, the dome being suspended in mid-air, and a complete planetarium mechanism that projected a starscape onto the dome above the dance floor. While open every weekend beginning in September, The Saint's once monthly parties became marathon events that drew gay men from around the world. These parties created the concept of a single disco party being the focal point for a weekend getaway in the gay community.
What was to become another circuit party was founded during the same time period by Corbett Reynolds, a Columbus, Ohio-based artist and nightclub owner in the late 1970s.  Initially, Reynolds envisioned a one-night party-to-end-all-parties, designed around the theme of the color Red (hence the name ""Red Party""), which was to be held at Reynolds' nightclub, “Rudely Elegant.”
The Red Party proved to be so successful, and drew so many outside visitors, that it filled the Valley Dale Dance Hall to capacity and became an annual event, outliving the closure of the bar in the early 1980s. Reynolds was a true artist, creating complete party-scapes all in red. On the 25th anniversary of the Red Party, the theme of which was to have been ""Rome"", Mr. Reynolds died. Those in charge of his estate thought about how, if at all, to continue the event and, in the end, decided to retire the concept of the ""Red Party"" and leave it to history.

AIDS crisis and growth of parties (1980s–1990s)
The early 1980s saw the start of the AIDS crisis, and entire communities were affected.  Several benefit parties sprang up around the country, which were run by volunteer organizations that donated their proceeds to HIV/AIDS-related charities, such as Halloween's in New Orleans. The success of these early parties gave way to other events hosted in other cities, with each party having its own theme.  Many were named after colors, such as White Party, Black Party, Blue Ball, and Black and Blue Festival.  And many center around other events, such as Southern Decadence and the Folsom Street Fair. Dance parties provided an environment in which gay men processed the experience of HIV/AIDS and served to build particular forms of communal response to the epidemic 

One economic reality of a well-run circuit party is that the event can bring large amounts of tourist dollars to the locality where the event is held.  Because of their economic impact, Circuit parties have been welcomed in some of the more liberal cities where they are held.
In the early 1990s, as more and more gay men became attracted to these mega dance-events, the real modern-day circuit party scene emerged and expanded into ever-larger productions, featuring superstar DJs and performers.  Promoters sometimes turned events from one party into a major series of parties at various venues, transforming a weekend into a three-day or longer continuous party.  For example, a pool party might go from noon to 5PM, a ""t-dance"" from 5PM to 9PM, a main event from 9PM to 4AM, and an after-hours party from 4AM until 12 noon, after which the cycle repeats itself.
To keep putting together these increasingly elaborate and costly productions, the prices (cover charge) of circuit parties increased greatly, so that it was not uncommon for a ticket covering the full weekend of parties to cost $400 or more.

Peak and decline in popularity (2000s)
Having reached its peak around 1999–2000 (as evidenced by the total number of events during those years, and the steady decline in the number of events since), the Circuit found itself a smaller part of a much larger whole. In 2004, The New York Times travel section featured an in-depth look at The White Party in Palm Springs in conjunction with staff members of Noizemag. The central focus was to determine why thousands of men spend multi-thousands of dollars to travel to this yearly event. Taken from the viewpoint of an experienced (female) raver, this gave the mainstream a view into what makes Circuit Parties so compelling for many and highlighted many of the changes taking place in these commercial events.
Nonetheless, the downward trend continued through the entire decade, with the downfall of a dozen events such as The Red Party, FireBall, Hotlanta, The Morning Party, Hell Ball, Reunion, and Motorball.
In the early 2000s, promoters became worried as attendance decreased dramatically at many circuit events.  This decline in attendance was attributed to several factors.  The original circuit audience that began attending the circuit parties of the '80s and '90s had grown older and no longer had such an active interest in multi-day partying. The communal experience of HIV/AIDS changed in the context of the availability of more effective treatments. In addition, all-gay cruises, which attract upwards of 1,500 passengers, have had a dramatic impact on the attendance at circuit parties.
Much had been said about the decline of the Circuit in recent years.  Some parties have disappeared from the landscape.  But the scene continues to thrive in many places with attendance rebounding from the dip that occurred after the new Millennium.  This is especially true at the better produced events, like Black and Blue in Montreal, and events that have more than just a circuit party to offer, such as Southern Decadence weekend in New Orleans.  Also, all-gay cruises that carry upwards of 2,000 passengers on week-long excursions to popular travel destinations continue to be very popular.

Recent resurgence (2010-present)
Circuit parties are currently organized in many international cities, each of them having another leading company, such as Matinee in Barcelona and WE Party Madrid.
Circuit parties seem to have gained widespread popularity again. This resulted in the annually organized Circuit Festival by the Matinée Group since 2008. Circuit Festival is currently the biggest international gay and lesbian event, hosting more than 50 DJs every year during twelve days of circuit parties, bringing together all leading international circuit brands in Barcelona. Since 2012 it has attracted an increasing number of gay visitors of over 70,000 per edition.
Circuit parties in the United States experienced a notable resurgence in the 2010s and consistently attract large crowds of gay men. In 2017, VICE News described them as parties ""where gay men seek sex and freedom.""

Culture and controversy
Observers within the gay and medical communities have published concerns about the culture of circuit parties, particularly the high use of drugs and mood changers including: alcohol, marijuana, methamphetamine, ecstasy, ketamine, GHB, amyl nitrite, and other ""party drugs"". It is common for circuit party promoters to hire medical professionals to be stationed outside venues in anticipation of drug overdoses, dehydration, or alcohol poisoning during an event. Also observers point to the risks of overdose and impaired judgment leading to more condomless sex and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) (see Sexual Ecology). Circuit parties have been blamed for the spread of substance abuse and the rise in transmission of STDs, particularly HIV, among gay men.

Overview and media perception
While open to anyone, the parties are generally viewed as social events primarily for physically fit and masculine-identified white gay men. Circuit parties charge admission, with some being run for-profit and others benefiting charities, generally those that benefit the LGBTQ communities or HIV/health related programs. Circuit parties can be expensive and lavish affairs with elaborate lighting, music, productions, decor, and are held in venues that can accommodate large crowds.
Circuit parties are known to attract a broad range of ages, from young gay men in their early 20s to those in their 40s, 50s and even 60s, and both single gay men and couples in long-term relationships. The parties are described by attendees as very important social events, analogous to a major holiday for some in the gay community. They can be described as a ""celebration"" of gay life and gay sexuality, an expression of freedom, and as a statement of the power and strength of the gay community.
Circuit parties are often perceived by outsiders as highly superficial; moreover those who attend them are often the target of broad and negative judgments by others in the gay community, usually because of the high amount of promiscuous sex and drug use that is often perceived to be associated with the events. A small body of empirical research from different research groups does, indeed, point to a high prevalence of drug use among people who attend circuit events during the course of the events and raises questions about an association between drug use and risky sex practices among gay and bisexual men Circuit parties frequently host celebrity performers or headliners, usually gay icons.
Men who frequent circuit parties and embody stereotypes affiliated with the typical attendee are often referred to as ""circuit queens.""  The term can be used in a derogatory or humorous manner depending on the context.

In 2023, all future events were cancelled and their LLC was legally dissolved due to under-performance and financial issues as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Events
Faerieworlds was started by Emilio and Kelly Miller-Lopez of the musical group Woodland, and Robert Gould of the transmedia arts company Imaginosis. The festival features artists, authors, musicians and crafters whose work is connected to or inspired by folklore, specifically faerie lore.

Locations
Faerieworlds Festivals have now taken place in Sedona and Prescott, Arizona, Santa Fe, New Mexico, Los Angeles, California, North Plains, Oregon, and from 2005 to 2008 at Secret House Winery in Veneta, Oregon. Faerieworlds 2009 was moved to Mount Pisgah to accommodate a larger number of daily attendees and to allow onsite camping to thousands of guests, and it was held there from 2010 to 2014. In 2014, the Lane County Board of Commissioners voted to not allow Faerieworlds, and another event, to use the Buford Park location in 2015.  The result of this was a return of the festival to Hornings Hideout, an outdoor festival venue just west of Portland Oregon.

Performers and artists
The festival main stage has included such acts as Donovan, Lindsey Stirling, Omnia, Wardruna, Faun, Rasputina, Solas, Woodland, Kila, Johnny Cunningham, Susan McKeown, John Renbourn, Karan Casey, Gaia Consort, Frenchy and the Punk, Sharon Knight, Priscilla Hernandez and Qntal.
Artists and authors featured at Faerieworlds have included  Brian Froud, Tony DiTerlizzi, Michael Hague, Wendy Froud, Jen Delyth, Terri Windling, Charles Vess, Charles De Lint and Amy Brown.

FaerieCon
The creators of Faerieworlds also produce an event on the east coast called FaerieCon International, which first took place on the weekend of October 10–12, 2007–2008 in Philadelphia at the Pennsylvania Convention Center.  FaerieCon moved to Baltimore in 2009 and took place at the Baltimore Marriott Hunt Valley Inn in 2009–2018, and the Sheraton Baltimore Waterfront Hotel in 2019. The 2020 event was canceled due to the ongoing pandemic. In February 2012 and 2013 FaerieCon West was held at the Renaissance Hotel in Seattle. FaerieCon West eventually was renamed  Mythicworlds: Convention and Masquerades, which took place annually at the Seatac Doubletree Hilton in 2017 and 2018.

It is a clothing optional event, and skyclad attendance is common.

History
The Starwood Festival was founded in 1981 by the Chameleon Club, a recognized student organization at Case Western Reserve University, which later founded the Association for Consciousness Exploration (ACE). It has been operated by ACE since 1983 under its co-directors, Jeff Rosenbaum and Joe Rothenberg. It featured entertainment, public ceremonies and rituals, and classes on subjects such as sensory isolation, Kirlian photography, Neopaganism, shamanism, Wicca, holistic health, tarot divination, Thelema, and past life regression.
The first Starwood was held July 24–26, 1981 at Coopers Lake Campground, the same site as the Society for Creative Anachronism's Pennsic War in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania. From 1982 through 1985 it was held at Devil's Den Park in New Philadelphia, Ohio, a former state park run by Whispering Winds Nudist Camp. In 1986 and 1987 it was held at Bear Creek Amphitheatre (part of Bear Creek Resort Ranch KOA) in East Sparta, Ohio, and at Echo Hills Ski Resort in Logan, Ohio (on the Buckeye Trail) in 1988 and 1989. The event moved to Brushwood Folklore Center, a private campground in Sherman, New York. from 1990 through 2009. Since 2010, Starwood has been held at Wisteria Campground in Pomeroy, Ohio.
The event began as a weekend festival, and grew over the years to a seven-day event. Attendance has grown from 185 in the first year to peak at around 1800 people in 2002, and has stayed between 1500 and 1650 since 1999. Since 1982, Starwood has been a clothing optional event, and skyclad attendance is common.

Activities
Starwood offers approximately 150 workshops, on topics including alternative lifestyles, political & spiritual activism, spiritual traditions,  consciousness-altering technologies and substances (such as biofeedback, sensory-isolation, mind machines, entheogenic and other mind-altering substances), martial arts & movement systems, history, magic, folklore, art & music, metaphysics and environmental issues.
There are classes on the drumming and dancing styles of Africa, South America, Ireland, the Middle East and elsewhere. All-night drummers' bonfires are held each night of the event in at least two locations: the ""Paw Paw Patch"" for larger drums such as djembes, and the ""DidgeDome"" for smaller drums such as bongos and tablas, accompanied by didgeridoos and quieter instruments. There are concerts held every lunchtime, dinnertime, and evening, and all-night multi-media enhanced parties in an inflatable structure called the ""PufferDome"" and in an adjacent area called the ""G-Spot"". Starwood provides child care and children's classes and programs in a playground area called ""Kids' Village"", and a schedule of classes and activities for teenagers. There are several areas devoted to multi-cultural ceremonies and rituals, and a non-Native sweat lodge. Friday night features a multi-media presentation, (often including fireworks, lasers, fire dancing, and synchronized music), and on the final night a torchlight procession leads to a huge bonfire.

People
Starwood is attended by people of all ages. Followers of diverse beliefs attend Starwood. According to the event organizers, the festival is designed for members of all spiritual paths to share their customs and beliefs. Some specific groups whose members regularly appear at and attend Starwood include the Church of All Worlds (CAW), the Church of the SubGenius, the Neo-Druidic group Ar nDraiocht Fein (ADF), and various Neopagan covens and organizations

The three-hour event is held in Salt Lake City starting at 9:00 a.m. MDT on or around July 24, the same day as Pioneer Day, a Utah state holiday.

History
On July 24, 1847, Brigham Young and a company of Mormon pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, where the Latter-day Saints settled after emigrating from Nauvoo, Illinois and other locations in the eastern United States.  Pulling handcarts or driving wagons with oxen or horses, thousands of pioneers made the trek across the plains to a vast desert landscape that became known as the Utah Territory.
According to Days of '47 Inc. ""This trek of the early Utah pioneers exemplifies the courage, foresight, and faith that continue to inspire modern-day pioneers.  By remembering those remarkable 1847 pioneers and all those who followed, The Days of '47 seeks to make their accomplishments and hardships live today through a variety of activities and celebrations each year.  We believe the example of past and present pioneers' courage is a beacon to the world.""
A parade was held on July 24, 1849, in Salt Lake City, long before Days of '47 became an official organization. Beginning in 1931, the ""'Covered Wagon Days"" parade became an annual event. Since the 1940s, the parade has been known by its current name.
LDS Church wards and stakes, businesses, and community groups have always sponsored floats in the parade. Recently, the parade has become more inclusive, with other churches participating and celebrating their own Utah pioneers. Native Americans march in the pre-parade, which travels down the parade route ahead of the pioneer floats. The military has always been well represented, and of course it always includes horses, bands, children and queens.
For many years, pioneers who arrived in the valley before 1869 were honored with a dinner each July 24. The last living pioneer died January 1, 1968. Her name was Hilda Erickson and she was 108 years old.
There was no parade between 1932 and 1934 because of the Great Depression, in 1943 because of World War II, or in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Performers and acts
In addition to the well-known floats, the parade also features live music and other performances. High school marching bands from across the state participate in the parade, and the television broadcasts feature performances by the bands.

Television coverage
The parade is televised throughout the intermountain area on NBC affiliate KSL-TV.

Parade route
The parade route starts at South Temple and State Street, goes east to 200 East, south to 900 South, then east to Liberty Park at 600 East. Traditionally a fair is held at Liberty Park, with games and rides.
For many decades, the parade started at Temple Square, went south on Main Street, turned east at 9th South, and continued heading east toward Liberty Park where the parade always ended.

Controversy and criticism
In 2014, Mormons Building Bridges, a group which works to improve relations between the LDS and LGBT communities, sought entry to march in the parade, but was denied because the group was deemed too controversial by the parade organizers. In response, the Salt Lake City Council considered boycotting their invitation to participate in the parade, but ultimately decided against a boycott as a Council, instead opting to simply express their opposition to the exclusion of Mormons Building Bridges. Council member Erin Mendenhall chose to decline her invitation to participate in the parade when after submitting the bio of her guest, a gay stay-at-home father married to a man, the organizers of the parade returned that only immediate relatives were eligible as guests of the council. Previously, the council had been informed they could bring ""one adult guest"".

History
The earliest precursor to Pioneer Day celebrations in Utah occurred on July 24, 1849, when the Nauvoo Brass Band led a commemoration of the second anniversary of the Latter-day Saints entering the Salt Lake Valley.
The celebration of Pioneer Day in 1857 was interrupted with news of the approach of Johnston's Army, heralding the beginning of the Utah War. Immediately following the occupation of the Utah Territory by federal troops, Pioneer Day was sparsely celebrated. Pioneer Day continually expanded into the surrounding areas as the Mormon Corridor spread throughout the Intermountain West. In 1880, Latter-day Saints commemorated the Golden Jubilee of the church's formal organization in 1830; tens of thousands of people in hundreds of communities participated in enthusiastic celebrations.
In the years that followed, federal enforcement efforts of anti-polygamy laws (including the 1882 Edmunds Act) resulted in greatly subdued celebrations. The 1886 commemoration was particularly notable for its mourning theme, with the Salt Lake Tabernacle decorated in black instead of the usually colorful bunting, and the eulogizing of Latter-day Saints who were in hiding or imprisoned for polygamy offenses. By 1897, the celebration included not only the 50th anniversary of the initial arrival in the Salt Lake Valley, but also the end of the polygamy issue, the completion of the Salt Lake Temple, and statehood for Utah.
The centennial in 1947 and the sesquicentennial in 1997 were especially large celebrations in Utah. One writer indicated that the 1947 celebrations seemed to incorporate the entire year, with July 24 only being an apex to the events.
The holiday generates a great deal of road traffic; Utah Department of Public Safety statistics states Pioneer Day has the second highest holiday traffic fatality rate in Utah, with the earlier July 4 Independence Day having the highest rate.
The holiday has received criticism for its lack of inclusiveness for non-Mormons. As a result, a small, growing contingent has started celebrating Pie and Beer Day instead of the traditional Pioneer Day. Pie and Beer day is a play on words: ""pie and beer"" sounds like ""pioneer."" Pie and Beer Day was created as a counter culture alternative.

Date
Vaisakhi is observed on the 13 or 14 April every year in the 21st century. However, in 1801 AD, it fell on 11 April. This is because the date of Vaisakhi and other Sankrantis keeps changing slowly over years. Vaisakhi would fall on 29 April in Year 2999. The festival coincides with other new year festivals celebrated on the first day of Vaisakh in other regions of the Indian Subcontinent such as Puthandu, Pohela Boishakh, Bohag Bihu, and Vishu.

Etymology and pronunciation
The word Vaisakhi or Baisakhi is an Apabhraṃśa form evolved from the word Vaishākhī (वैशाखी), derived from the name of the Indian month of Vaishakha. There is no distinction between sounds 'sha' (श) & 'sa' (स) and between 'va' (व) & 'ba' (ब) in Prakrit & Apbhramsa. Hence the name, Vaisakhi or Baisakhi. Vaisakhi which is observed on Sankranti of Vaisakh (Vaishakh) month literally means 'related to Vaisakh month', which in turn is derived from the name of a Nakshatra known as Vishakha. In Punjab region, the word Vaisakhi is common, but in the Dogra regions, and the Doabi and Malwai dialects of Punjab, speakers often substitute a B for a V, so it is known as Baisakhi or Basakhi; also people in Jammu call it Basoa.

Hinduism
For most of the Hindus, the first day of Vaisakh marks the traditional solar new year, in Assam, Bengal, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Kerala, Odisha, Punjab Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Uttrakhand and other parts of India. However, this is not the universal new year for all Hindus. For some, such as those in and near Gujarat, the new year festivities coincide with the five-day Diwali festival. For others, the new year falls on Cheti Chand, Gudi Padwa and Ugadi which falls a few weeks earlier. The harvest is complete and crops ready to sell, representing a time of plenty for the farmers. Fairs and special thanksgiving pujas (prayers) are common in the Hindu tradition. It is available in the Vanis of the saints that in Satlok, the Vaisakhi-like atmosphere always remains there.
It is regionally known by many names among the Hindus, though the festivities and its significance is similar. It is celebrated by Hindus bathing in sacred rivers, as they believe that river goddess Ganges descended to earth on Vaisakhi from Svarga. Some rivers considered particularly sacred include the Ganges, Jhelum and Kaveri. Hindus visit temples, meet friends and party over festive foods.

The occasion is marked by numerous fairs and people come by the thousands to celebrate Vaisakhi. For example, Airwan in Kathua is known for Vaisakhi fair attended by 10,000 people as per Census 1961. Every year on Baisakhi festival around 15,000 pilgrims pay their obeisance at 700 tear old temple of Subar Nag Devta temple in Bhaderwah.

Vishu
Vishu is a Hindu festival celebrated on the same day as Vaisakhi in the Indian state of Kerala, and falls on the first day of Malayali month called Medam. The festival is notable for its solemnity and the general lack of pomp and show that characterize other Hindu festivals of Kerala such as Onam.
The festival is marked by family time, preparing colorful auspicious items and viewing these as the first thing on the Vishu day. In particular, Malayali Hindus seek to view the golden blossoms of the Indian laburnum (Kani Konna), money or silver items (Vishukkaineetam), and rice. The day also attracts firework play by children, wearing new clothes (Puthukodi) and the eating a special meal called Sadya, which is a mix of salty, sweet, sour and bitter items.

Bohag Bihu or Rangali Bihu marks the beginning of the Assamese New Year on 13 April. It is celebrated for seven days Vishuva Sankranti (Mesha Sankranti) of the month of Vaisakh or locally 'Bohag' (Bhaskar Calendar). The three primary types of Bihu are Rongali Bihu, Kongali Bihu, and Bhogali Bihu. Each festival historically recognizes a different agricultural cycle of the paddy crops. During Rangali Bihu there are 7 pinnacle phases: 'Chot', 'Raati', 'Goru', 'Manuh', 'Kutum', 'Mela' and 'Chera'.

Maha Vishuba Sankranti
Pana Sankranti (ପଣା ସଂକ୍ରାନ୍ତି) also known as Maha Vishuba Sankranti marks the Odia new year in Odisha. Celebrations include various types of folk and classical dances, such as the Shiva-related Chhau dance. On this day people hang pieces of Neem branches with leaves in front of their houses believed to have health benefits. They prepare a liquid mixture of jaggery, mango, pepper and other ingredients which is called Pana (ପଣା). An earthen pot with a small hole and a grass (କୁୁଶ) within the hole at the bottom is hung over the Tulasi (ତୁୁୁଳସୀ ଚଉରା). The pot is filled with water daily which acts as a drip to protect the sacred plant from the summer heat.

Poyla Boishakh
Poyla Baishakh is the first day of the Bengali calendar and is celebrated on 14 April every year in the states of West Bengal, Tripura, Jharkhand and Assam (Barak Valley) by Bengali Hindus.
Some historians attribute the Bengali calendar to the 7th-century king Shashanka. The term Bangabda (Bangla year) is found too in two Shiva temples many centuries older than Akbar era, suggesting that Bengali calendar existed before Akbar's time. Various dynasties whose territories extended into Bengal, prior to the 13th-century, used the Vikram Samvat. Buddhist texts and inscriptions created in the Pala Empire era mention ""Vikrama"" and the months such as Ashvin, a system found in Sanskrit texts elsewhere in ancient and medieval Indian subcontinent.

Puthandu
Puthandu, also known as Puthuvarusham or Tamil New Year, is the first day of the month Chithirai on the Tamil calendar. On this day, Tamil people greet each other by saying ""Puttāṇṭu vāḻttukkaḷ!"" or ""Iṉiya puttāṇṭu nalvāḻttukkaḷ!"", which is equivalent to ""Happy New Year"". The day is observed as a family time. Households clean up the house, prepare a tray with fruits, flowers and auspicious items, light up the family Puja altar and visit their local temples. People wear new clothes and youngsters go to elders to pay respects and seek their blessings, then the family sits down to a vegetarian feast.

Jur Sital in Bihar
In the Mithila region of Bihar and Nepal, the new year is celebrated as Jur Sital. It is traditional to use lotus leaves to serve sattu (powdered meal derived from grains of red gram and jau (Hordeum vulgare) and other ingredients) to the family members.

It occurs during mid-April every year and traditionally in Punjab, the festival corresponds with the first harvesting of the crops for the year. Historically, the festival has been a very joyous occasion and a time for celebration. However, since 1699, it has marked the very significant religious event of the creation of the Khalsa Panth.
Vaisakhi falls on the first day of the Vaisakh month and marks the sun's entry to the Mesha Rasi (Mesha Sankranti) marking the solar transition to Aries.  The day is also described as a sacred festival for Sikhs in India as it marks the birth of the Khalsa.
The significance of Vaisakhi as a Sikh religious festival started after the execution of Guru Tegh Bahadur for refusing to convert to Islam under the orders of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. This triggered the ascension of Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Guru of Sikhism, who subsequently inaugurated the Khalsa on Vaisakhi of 1699. The increased persecution of Sikhs by Mughal authorities followed a period of increasing strength of the Sikh movement in the Malwa region of Punjab during the period of Guru Tegh Bahadur, which would lead to his execution and the resulting foundation of the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh, to defend religious freedoms. This gave Vaisakhi the added dimension of being observed as a celebration of the formation of the Khalsa, and is also known as Khalsa Sirjana Divas or Khalsa Sajna Divas.  The Birth of the Khalsa Panth was on 30 March 1699.
Later, Ranjit Singh was proclaimed as Maharaja of the Sikh Empire on 12 April 1801 (to coincide with Vaisakhi), creating a unified political state, with Sahib Singh Bedi, a descendant of Guru Nanak, conducting the coronation.
Vaisakhi is celebrated in much the same way as Gurpurab, or a Guru's birthday anniversary, with gurdwaras being decorated and attended by Sikhs who listen to kirtan and religious discourses there. Many Sikhs also choose to be inducted into the Khalsa order on this day. After the prayers, karah parshad is then served to the congregation, and the function ends with a langar, or community lunch. The festival is marked with a nagar kirtan street procession headed by a group of Panj Pyare representatives, and music, singing, and chanting scriptures are part of the celebration.

Punjab
Fairs and melas are held in many places in Punjab to celebrate the formation of the Khalsa. According to Dogra and Dogra (2003), ""an annual fair is held at Takht Kesgarh Sahib on Baisakhi day"". A procession is lead through the city of Anandpur to mark the occasion. Other important places where large gatherings take place are Harmandar Sahib, Amritsar and Takht Sri Damdama Sahib, Talwandi Sabo. A special celebration takes place at Talwandi Sabo (where Guru Gobind Singh stayed for nine months and completed the recompilation of the Guru Granth Sahib), in the Gurudwara at Anandpur Sahib the birthplace of the Khalsa, and at the Golden Temple in Amritsar.

Vaisakhi is a harvest festival for people of Northern India. Chander and Dogra (2003) state that in Punjab, Vaisakhi marks the ripening of the rabi harvest. According to Dhillon (2015), in Punjab, this day is observed as a thanksgiving day by farmers whereby farmers pay their tribute, thanking God for the abundant harvest and also praying for future prosperity. The harvest festival is celebrated by Hindus and Sikhs. In the Punjab,  historically, during the early 20th century, Vaisakhi was a sacred day for Hindus and Sikhs and a secular festival for all Muslims and Christians. In modern times, sometimes Christians in Punjab participate in Baisakhi celebrations along with Hindus and Sikhs. The harvest festival is also characterized by the folk dance, Bhangra which traditionally is a harvest dance.
Aawat pauni is a tradition associated with harvesting in the Punjab, which involves people getting together to harvest the wheat.

Himachal Pradesh
A large number of Sikhs visit Paonta Sahib on the festival of Vaisakhi. According to Sahi (1999), Paonta Sahib ""was the abode of Guru Gobind Singh Ji for a couple of years."" Paanta Sahib Gurdwara is in Sirmaur district in Himachal Pradesh. The site is located near the river Yamuna. The tricentenary celebrations to mark the birth of the Khalsa were started from Paanta Sahib Gurdwara in 1999.

Jammu
Gurdwara Dera Nangali Sahib in Jammu was established in 1803. The Gurdwara is situated in the Poonch district of Jammu. An annual gathering takes place at the gurdwara on the on Baisakhi when many people participate in the day-long function of Baisakhi. Dera Nangali Sahib is known as a centre for Sikhism in Jammu.  The other important gurdwara is the Dera Baba Banda which is dedicated to Banda Bahadur. The gurdwara is located near Reasi. Baisakhi celebrations take place at this Dera.

Kashmir
Sikhs in Kashmir celebrate Vaisakhi as a religious festival to mark the foundation of the Khalsa. Unlike in the North Indian plains where Vaisalhi is also associated with harvesting, Sikhs in Kashmir mark the day when Guru Gobind Singh baptised the Panj Pyare. Bajan Keertans are held in all gurdwaras in Kashmir. However, the main celebration takes place at Chatti Pathshahi Gurdwara in Rainawari. Sikhs will visit friends and family in Vaisakhi. People will wear special clothes and prepare special food to mark the festival. Sikhs will also visit the gardens and markets. The mode of celebration is believed to be different to the way the festival is celebrated elsewhere.

Nihang
The Nihang (Punjabi: ਨਿਹੰਗ) or Akali lit. 'the immortals' is an armed Sikh warrior order originating in the Indian subcontinent. Nihang are believed to have originated either from Fateh Singh and the attire he wore or from the ""Akali Dal"" (lit. Army of the Immortal) started by Guru Hargobind. Early Sikh military history was dominated by the Nihang, known for their victories where they were heavily outnumbered. Traditionally known for their bravery and ruthlessness in the battlefield, the Nihang once formed the irregular guerrilla squads of the armed forces of the Sikh Empire, the Sikh Khalsa Army.
Nihangs mark Vaisakhi in their own unique manner. They will engage in martial arts and participate in Gatkas. They will also exhibit displays of horsemanship. According to Singh and Fenech (2014), Nihangs will move to the city of Amritsar on Vaisakhi day.

Sikh celebrations outside India
Pakistan
Pakistan has many sites that are of historic importance to the Sikh faith, such as the birthplace of Guru Nanak. These sites attract pilgrims from India and abroad every year on Vaisakhi. Pakistan used to have many more Sikhs, but a vast majority moved to India during the 1947 India-Pakistan partition. Contemporary Pakistan has about 20,000 Sikhs in a total population of about 200 million Pakistanis, or about 0.01%. These Sikhs, and thousands more who arrive from other parts of the world for pilgrimage, observe Vaisakhi in Western Punjab (Pakistan) with festivities centered on the Panja Sahib complex in Hasan Abdal, Gurudwaras in Nankana Sahib, and in various historical sites in Lahore.
In western Punjab, Punjabi Muslims used to celebrate Baisakhi as a harvest festival, but Islamist policies of Zia-ul-Haq led to the ending of its observance, becoming solely viewed as a Sikh celebration rather than a pan-Punjabi one. According to Aziz-ud-din Ahmed, Lahore used to have Baisakhi Mela after the harvesting of the wheat crop in April. However, adds Ahmed, the city started losing its cultural vibrancy in 1970s after Zia-ul-Haq came to power, and in recent years ""the Pakistan Muslim League (N) government in Punjab banned kite flying through an official edict more under the pressure of those who want a puritanical version of Islam to be practiced in the name of religion than anything else"". Unlike the Indian state of Punjab that recognizes the Vaisakhi Sikh festival as an official holiday, the festival is not an official holiday in Punjab or Sindh provinces of Pakistan as Sikhs constitute a very small number in terms of population.
In April 2010, the Federal Ministry of Minorities in Pakistan announced that Baisakhi would be officially recognized as a holiday. The Pakistani government welcomes Sikh pilgrims from India to celebrate Baisakhi within its borders.

Canada
British Columbia
In the Province of British Columbia, large, local Sikh communities in the cities of Vancouver, Abbotsford, and Surrey hold their annual Vaisakhi celebrations in April, which include two Nagar Kirtan (parades).
In Vancouver, the parade was first held in 1979 and is the largest annual single-day festival in the city. The parade starts at Ross Street Temple and makes its way through the traditional Punjabi Market in the Sunset neighbourhood of South Vancouver, attracting up to 300,000 people.
One week later, the festival in Surrey is one of the largest such celebrations outside of India, having attracted over 200,000 people in 2014, over 350,000 in 2015, and approached 400,000 in 2016. The 2017 attendance in Surrey reportedly topped 400,000, causing organizers to consider future distribution of the festival over several days and local cities, particularly in areas of economic disadvantage which would benefit from the generous charitable efforts seen during Vaisakhi celebrations. Record attendance was again experienced in April 2018 in the 20th annual Surrey Vaisakhi parade, with the RCMP officially estimating the crowd at over half a million people in a city with a 2016 census population of 517,887. Starting at the Gurdwara Dashmesh Darbar Temple (12885 85th Avenue in Surrey), the parade features a variety of floats, community groups, free food, live music and dancers and performers, and travels along 124th Street, turns left onto 75th Avenue, continues on 76th Avenue, onto 128th Street, then back to the Temple.
Kelowna's annual Vaisakhi parade is held a week after Surrey's parade each year and begins and ends at the Sikh Temple on Rutland Road.
Victoria's all-day Vaisakhi celebration features a parade that begins and ends at Gurdwara Singh Sabha, 470 Cecelia Road. The 2018 celebrations on 29 April would be the first held in Victoria in over 100 years.

Ontario
In the Province of Ontario, the Toronto Vaisakhi Parade is held in April, starting at the Canadian National Exhibition grounds and traveling east to Toronto City Hall, finishing almost three hours later. Following the parade, dignitaries address the gathering until late afternoon.
In the city of Brampton, the Gurudwara Sikh Sangat temple and Gobind Sarvar Gurmat School hold Vaisakhi cultural events such as yoga, pagh (turban) tying, storytelling, and food fairs.
In the city of Malton, a three-hour Nagar Kirtan parade winds from Morning Star, Goreway, Derry Rd, & Airport Rd to Malton Gurdwara Sahib.

Prairies
In the Province of Alberta, the Edmonton Vaisakhi parade is held in May and travels between the Gurdwara Singh Sabha (4504 Millwoods Road S) & Gurdwara Millwoods (2606 Millwoods Road E) temples.
In the Province of Saskatchewan, the Saskatoon Vaisakhi parade is held in May, starting and ending at the Gurudwara Sahib Temple at 331 Lowe Road.

Atlantic
In the Province of Nova Scotia, the Halifax-based Maritime Sikh Society holds Vaisakhi celebrations in April featuring Shabad Kirtan performed by professional ragis (musicians).

United Kingdom
The United Kingdom has a large Sikh community originating from the Indian sub-continent, East Africa and Afghanistan. The largest concentrations of Sikhs in the UK are to be found in the West Midlands (especially Birmingham and Wolverhampton) and London. The Southall Nagar Kirtan is held on a Sunday a week or two before Vaisakhi. The Birmingham Nagar Kirtan is held in late April in association with Birmingham City Council, and is an annual event attracting thousands of people which commences with two separate nagar kirtans setting off from gurdwaras in the city and culminating in the Vaisakhi Mela at Handsworth Park.

United States
Amongst Sikh populations in the United States, there is usually a parade commemorating the Vaisakhi celebration. In Manhattan, New York City people come out to do ""Seva"" (selfless service) such as giving out free food, and completing any other labor that needs to be done. In Los Angeles, California, the local Sikh community consisting of many gurdwaras holds a full day Kirtan (spiritual music) program followed by a parade.

Malaysia
The Sikh community, a subgroup of the Malaysian Indian ethnic minority race, is an ethnoreligious minority in Malaysia, which is why Vaisakhi is not a public holiday. However, in line with the government's efforts to promote integration among the country's different ethnic and religious groups, has announced that beginning 2013, all government servants from the Sikh Malaysian Indian community will be given a day off on Vaisakhi Day. Vaisakhi 'open houses' are also held across the country during the day of the festival, or the closest weekend to it.

Buddhism
The new year falls on or about the same day every year for many Buddhist communities in parts of South and Southeast Asia. This is likely an influence of their shared culture in the 1st millennium CE. Some examples include:

Sangken in Arunachal Pradesh and parts of Assam, India
Aluth Avuruthu in Sri Lanka.
Chol Chnam Thmey in Cambodia
Pi Mai in Laos
Songkran in Thailand
Thingyan in Myanmar
Water-Sprinkling Festival, celebrated by the Dai people in Sipsongpanna in Yunnan, China

As a harvest festival
Vaisakhi is a harvest festival for people of Northern India. Chander and Dogra (2003) state that in Punjab, Vaisakhi marks the ripening of the rabi harvest. Vaisakhi, the Hindu Solar new year, also marks the Nepalese, Punjabi and Bengali New year.  Fairs or Melas (fair) are held in many parts of North India to mark the new year and the harvesting season. Vaisakhi fairs take place in various places, including Jammu City, Kathua, Udhampur, Reasi and Samba, in the Pinjore complex near Chandigarh, in Himachal Pradesh cities of Rewalsar, Shimla, Mandi and Prashar Lakes. According to Ann Louise Wood, Vaisakhi is a festival that is celebrated by the Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims of Punjab.

First event
When July 5, 1998 arrived and no alien fleet appeared in the sky, members of the Church began citing a large number of conspiracy theories to explain why the predicted end of the world did not take place. The manual page of the ddate program claims that the Church ""declared that it had got the year upside down"" and that X-Day will actually take place in 8661. The most popular explanation for the failure of the prophecy in the Church is usually summarized with the statement, ""the calendar is wrong and July 5th, 1998 has not really arrived yet."" Because of this, the Church has held annual gatherings around July 5 of each year since 1998 to celebrate X-Day and greet the arrival of the anticipated alien ""Sex Goddesses.""  No flying saucer rendezvous has been confirmed as of 2022, but members of the Church have been undaunted. A more recent theory suggests that the X-ists did indeed come to Earth on July 5, 1998 as foretold by ""Bob,"" but through one of the most pervasive Conspiracy coverups, Earth and Mars were switched, and the ""Earth"" we know is actually Mars. And thus, as there was nobody on the True Earth at the time of their arrival, there was nobody there to witness the Rupture.
The X-Day celebration has become well known in underground culture circles, especially in pagan communities. Many underground rock bands have performed at X-Day, and the event has evolved into a festival similar to Burning Man, lasting for three to five days, with rock concerts, artistic events, bonfires, and parties taking place day and night. Of the various X-Day celebrations that have taken place, the largest and most popular each year was held at the Brushwood Folklore Center in Sherman, New York until 2011, when it was relocated to the Wisteria Event Campground in Pomeroy, Ohio. In 2021 it was announced that the ""official"" X-Day would be moved again to the Land of ID resort in Land o' Lakes, Florida.

Event activities
Regular events at X-Day include a symbolic effigy burning of J.R. ""Bob"" Dobbs (the founder of the Church of the SubGenius); a baptism (""Bob""tism) where participants have their sins ""washed away"", ""and receive new ones in return""; concerts and performances by underground rock bands and performance artists; theme camps; and an auction where participants are encouraged to donate strange, unusual, and offensive items of all sorts (including themselves).
""Burners"" familiar with the Burning Man event have been upset by the fact that X-Day is not a commerce-free event in the fashion of Burning Man – the bands and participants at X-Day are, in fact, encouraged to sell their own items, music CDs and albums, and other paraphernalia. The Church of the SubGenius has responded to these complaints with the statement that it is not a non-profit church:  ""We're for-profit, we want profit, and we want to cast out false prophets.""  However, the Church's status as an independent corporation with no corporate affiliations has ensured that large, mainstream companies have avoided the X-Day celebration, allowing independent artists and underground performers to flourish. The Church claims to be the only religious organization that is ""proud to pay its taxes"".

History
In 2007, the celebration notably coincided with Roswell, New Mexico's 60th anniversary celebration of a purported 'UFO incident'.

History
The earliest precursor to Pioneer Day celebrations in Utah occurred on July 24, 1849, when the Nauvoo Brass Band led a commemoration of the second anniversary of the Latter-day Saints entering the Salt Lake Valley.
The celebration of Pioneer Day in 1857 was interrupted with news of the approach of Johnston's Army, heralding the beginning of the Utah War. Immediately following the occupation of the Utah Territory by federal troops, Pioneer Day was sparsely celebrated. Pioneer Day continually expanded into the surrounding areas as the Mormon Corridor spread throughout the Intermountain West. In 1880, Latter-day Saints commemorated the Golden Jubilee of the church's formal organization in 1830; tens of thousands of people in hundreds of communities participated in enthusiastic celebrations.
In the years that followed, federal enforcement efforts of anti-polygamy laws (including the 1882 Edmunds Act) resulted in greatly subdued celebrations. The 1886 commemoration was particularly notable for its mourning theme, with the Salt Lake Tabernacle decorated in black instead of the usually colorful bunting, and the eulogizing of Latter-day Saints who were in hiding or imprisoned for polygamy offenses. By 1897, the celebration included not only the 50th anniversary of the initial arrival in the Salt Lake Valley, but also the end of the polygamy issue, the completion of the Salt Lake Temple, and statehood for Utah.
The centennial in 1947 and the sesquicentennial in 1997 were especially large celebrations in Utah. One writer indicated that the 1947 celebrations seemed to incorporate the entire year, with July 24 only being an apex to the events.
The holiday generates a great deal of road traffic; Utah Department of Public Safety statistics states Pioneer Day has the second highest holiday traffic fatality rate in Utah, with the earlier July 4 Independence Day having the highest rate.
The holiday has received criticism for its lack of inclusiveness for non-Mormons. As a result, a small, growing contingent has started celebrating Pie and Beer Day instead of the traditional Pioneer Day. Pie and Beer day is a play on words: ""pie and beer"" sounds like ""pioneer."" Pie and Beer Day was created as a counter culture alternative.

It has been held at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, since 2003, with the exception of 2021 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was previously held at the Astrodome. According to Xinhua, it is ""considered as the biggest event of the year in Houston"".
In 2007, the rodeo was deemed ""the year of the volunteer."" In 2017, attendance reached a record high of 2,611,176 people and 33,000 volunteers. In 2025, a new attendance record was set with 2,735,695 people. The event is 20 days long. It is kicked off by the Downtown Rodeo Roundup held near Houston City Hall, the Downtown Rodeo parade, and the ConocoPhillips Rodeo Run – a 10k and 5k walk & run and the World's Championship Bar-B-Que Contest. The show features championship rodeo action, livestock competitions, concerts, a carnival, pig racing, barbecue and the Rodeo Uncorked! International Wine Competition, shopping, sales and livestock auctions. Traditional trail rides, which start in different areas of Texas and end in Houston, precede the Rodeo events. The City of Houston celebrates this event with Go Texan Day, where residents are encouraged to dress in western wear the Friday before the rodeo begins.

History
Early years
In the early part of the 20th century, Houston-area ranchers developed a new breed of cattle, the American Brahman, which was a blend of four breeds of cattle from India. The cattle were well-adapted to the hot, swampy conditions of the Texas Gulf Coast. In the early 1920s, James W. Sartwelle, a stockyard manager from Sealy, Texas, founded the American Brahman Breeders Association. Ranchers had no opportunities to show their cattle and raise awareness of the breed. Some attempted to show at the Southwestern Exposition and Livestock Show in Fort Worth, Texas, but they weren't allowed into the main arena.
In January 1932, Sartwelle invited six other businessmen to a lunch at the Texas State Hotel. They decided to host a livestock exposition in Houston.  Sartwelle was named the first president of the new Houston Fat Stock Show.  Their inaugural event was held in late April 1932 at the Democratic Convention Hall in downtown Houston. It was primarily a regional event, designed to showcase the agriculture and livestock, including Brahmans, in the area around Houston. The show lasted one week and ran a deficit of $2,800.  Approximately 2,000 people attended the exposition, where they were also entertained by the Future Farmers Band, comprising 68 high school students from around the state. The Grand Champion Steer was purchased by a local restaurant owner for $504.
The Fat Stock Show was held annually for the next four years. Realizing they had outgrown the space, organizers began looking for a larger venue.  Shortly after the 1936 show ended, Sam Houston Hall was torn down. Sam Houston Coliseum, a 10,000-seat arena, would take its place. To allow for construction time, the 1937 exposition was cancelled. The year off allowed Fat Stock show organizers to solidify plans for a larger event. When the show resumed in 1938, it included a parade through downtown Houston, a carnival and midway, and a rodeo with a total purse of $640.50.
In the 1940s, despite World War II, organizers added musical entertainment. Local talent was invited to perform after the rodeo on some evenings. In 1942, singing cowboy Gene Autry became the first nationally recognized entertainer to perform at the show.
Attendance flagged in the early 1950s. To attract more attention to the event, organizers decided to hold a cattle drive. In 1952, the media were invited to join cowboys on a 75 miles (121 km) trek from Brenham, Texas to the Fat Stock Show. The publicity stunt was well received. The following year, the Salt Grass Trail Association again held the cattle drive. Other areas of the state organized their own trail rides to the show. This began the transition from a smaller regional event to larger, statewide notice.
Archer Romero, one of the key proponents of the trail ride, took over as president of the Fat Stock Show in 1954. That year, he founded the Go Texan Committee to further publicize the show. The committee would designate a day shortly before the show commenced as Go Texan Day. They encouraged Houston residents to dress in Western wear. The day had the dual purpose of celebrating Texas culture and advertising the show.
In 1957, Myrtis Dightman organized the first trail ride for African-Americans. He led 10 other cowboys in a ride from Prairie View, Texas to Houston. Because of their color, they were not welcomed in Memorial Park, where trail riders typically spent the night. Armed guards were there to ensure that the men could enter safely.
That same year, the show granted its first major scholarship. Ben Dickerson was given $2,000 ($16,000 in 2016) towards his education. This was the first step a major shift in the show's purpose. Over the next few decades, the show placed an increasing emphasis on education and scholarships.

Astrodome era
Throughout the 1950s, influential local leaders had been advocating that the city acquire a professional sports team. In 1957, the Texas State Legislature granted Harris County the ability to issue bonds to finance a new stadium, so that the city could attract a team. The county put together a commission to formulate a plan. Romero stepped down as Fat Stock Show president to join the commission. They visited stadiums in several large cities, as well as a fairgrounds in Oklahoma. After several years of research, the commission recommended that the county build both a stadium and a connected, air-conditioned coliseum. The presentation to the county commissioners listed four main uses for the new facility: 1) Major league baseball, 2) football, 3) the Fat Stock Show, and 4) various other activities.
County commissioners approved the project, sending it to a vote of Harris County residents. Just before the election, Fat Stock Show organizers announced that the show would donate 230 acres (93 ha) near South Main for the project, provided the show have input into the design. Voters approved the new stadium, and the Fat Stock Show became one of the focal residents of the new Astrodome. 
The show was renamed the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo in 1961.  The show had continued to grow, and organizers realized that Sam Houston Coliseum would not be a viable alternative for much longer. The number of exhibitors had declined because many activities were held outside in tents. The chicken, rabbit, and hog shows were cancelled because organizers could not find space for them. Construction began on the Astrohall, next to the Astrodome, in 1965. The following year, the Livestock Show and Rodeo officially moved to the Astrodome. To mark their new location, the organizing committee introduced a new logo, the Bowlegged H. The first night of the rodeo featured entertainment by the stars of the television series Gunsmoke. Some locals scoffed at the idea that the rodeo and concert could fill a 45,000-seat stadium, but more than 40,000 fans attended the rodeo the night Jimmy Dean performed that year.
Elvis Presley performed at the 1970 show, held in the Astrodome.
Louis Pearce Jr. served sixty years as a board member of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. He served on the executive committee as president and CEO, and remained an active executive committee member until his death in 2012. As a result of his dedication and significant contributions to the event, Pearce became known as ""Mr. Houston Livestock Show"".
The first Hispanic trail ride commenced in 1973. Calling themselves Los Vaqueros Rio Grande Trail Ride, the group journeyed 400 miles (640 km) from the border crossing at Reynosa, Mexico to Houston.
The Go Texan committee launched the World's Championship Bar-B-Que Contest in 1974. Seventeen teams entered the competition, which was held in the Astrodome parking lot. Teams were asked to barbecue a minimum of 10 pounds (4.5 kg) on a wood fire. The inaugural judges included actor Ben Johnson. The competition grew in popularity; by 1981 it had grown to over 200 teams, with 45,000 people visiting.
In 1988, the show added a 5k run and 10k fun run through downtown Houston. Participants would pay an entry fee, with proceeds going to the scholarship fund.

1990s
By the 1990s, the show had been expanded to 20 days. Each evening featured a rodeo, sanctioned by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). The rodeo offered hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money, second only to the National Finals Rodeo. After the rodeo, attendees would see a concert, usually by a famous entertainer. Tickets were relatively inexpensive. For $10 or a little more, a person could buy a ticket to see the livestock shows, wild west shows, the rodeo and concert, and enjoy the carnival. The livestock show was billed as the largest of its kind, with more animals shown by adolescents than anywhere else in the country. Winning livestock were auctioned at the end of the judging, and in the 1990s the combined auction take was usually over $7 million. This was far beyond market value.
The rodeo was generally limited to the top PRCA contestants, based on prize money earned throughout the year. It was popular with cowboys; Houston won the inaugural Indoor Rodeo Committee of the Year award from the PRCA in 1992 and then won each of the next four years as well. The facility had huge screens hanging from the ceiling. Attendees could watch the competition live, then see an instant replay on the screens.
In 1996, the rodeo was halted one evening. The crew on the space shuttle Columbia appeared live on the big screens to address the crowd. Later that year, country singer George Strait set a record, having played to more than 1 million Houston rodeo attendees. The 1996 rodeo earned a net profit of $16.8 million and gave more than $7.9 million away in scholarships, assistantships, and research grants.
The Hideout was created in 1997 to give attendees more entertainment options after the rodeo and concert had ended. It is a nightclub for adults over 21 to dance and drink.

21st century
A new venue, Reliant Stadium (now NRG Stadium), was built on the Astrodome grounds in 2002. The rodeo marked its last night in the Astrodome on March 3, 2002, with a performance by country legend George Strait. The show was recorded and became Strait's first official live album, For the Last Time: Live from the Astrodome. Following the show, the Astrohall was torn down. A new exhibition space, Reliant Center, was constructed on the grounds, expanding exhibition capacity to 1.4 million square feet. Rodeo executives moved their offices into the second floor of the center. When the rodeo opened in 2003 in its new homes, Strait performed on opening night.  In the first two seasons at Reliant, the Hideout was cancelled, but it resumed in 2005, now located within the Astrodome.
In 2004, show organizers added a new event, Rodeo Uncorked! International. Vintners from around the world entered their wines into a competition. These were then auctioned, raising $313,700. The following year, the wine auction raised more than $500,000.  To give livestock show attendees the opportunity to taste the wines, the show launched the Wine Garden in 2008.
Attendance at the rodeo began falling. Attendees would purchase a ticket and arrive just before the concert, leaving a largely empty stadium for the rodeo itself. Joe Bruce Hancock, then the general manager of the rodeo, theorized that the audience was more urban and less familiar with rodeo events. The current show structure moved slowly and made it difficult for this type of audience to follow what was happening. As one of the PRCA-sanctioned rodeos, show organizers had little ability to make changes. The PRCA required that certain events be held, dictated the general structure of the rodeo, and insisted that each organizing committee use the PRCA national registration system. This meant that rodeos did not know which contestants were going to be appearing, or on which days.
The Houston rodeo committee requested a waiver from the PRCA in 2008. Houston would still remit 6% of the rodeo purse to the PRCA, but they would change the format and the registration system. Now, the rodeo knew who would be competing on which days and could market those individual appearances. The rodeo was restructured into a playoff format. Attendance at the rodeo skyrocketed.  Champion bareback rider Bobby Mote said competitors appreciated the changes: ""It was exciting to be a part of because people were really getting into it. Finally, we were performing for a real crowd in Houston.""  The finale of the 2008 rodeo was the PRCA's Xtreme Bulls tour.  The same year, HLSR was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame along with 15 other PRCA rodeos that had previously been granted special recognition.
During the 2009 state legislative session, local state senator Mario Gallegos filed a bill that would require the livestock show organizing committee to comply with the state open records rules. The bill would also encourage the rodeo to contract with more minority-owned business and to add minorities to the livestock show's executive committee. At the time, the 19-member executive committee composed entirely of men, without a single Hispanic or African-American representative. Livestock show President Leroy Shafer insisted that the legislation was unprecedented, and that non-profits should not be held to the same standards as public entities. Shafer maintained that the executive committee membership was determined in large part by length of volunteer service, with the members having served, on average, for 37.5 years. According to Shafer, in time minorities and women would accumulate the years of service required to be on the committee. Minority leaders in Houston advocated a boycott. The controversy caused new Harris County sheriff Adrian Garcia to decline an invitation to be co-grand marshal of the rodeo parade, although Garcia still marched in the parade as part of the sheriff's office mounted patrol.
When the Astrodome was permanently closed in 2009, the Hideout moved to a giant tent on the grounds of the facility.
The rodeo's waiver from the PRCA expired in 2011. Houston applied for a renewal but were denied. The PRCA was under new management, who insisted that all of their rodeos should abide by the same rules. The show ended its contract with the organization, making the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo an independent rodeo. As an unsanctioned rodeo, none of the prize money would count towards competitors' world standings, and thus qualification for the National Finals Rodeo. Some competitors were upset with the change, as winning the RodeoHouston $50,000 prize had generally been enough to qualify a cowboy for the National Finals Rodeo.  However, because the $1.75 million purse was the largest one in rodeo at that time, there was little difficulty in attracting cowboys. Because they were now independent, the show could now invite specific competitors who might not otherwise have qualified to appear, such as local cowboy, 8-time world champion calf roper Fred Whitfield.  Of the 280 competitors invited to attend in 2012, all but one accepted.
In an additional change, the rodeo dropped the PRCA's Xtreme Bulls tour from its last evening. As a replacement, they offered the Cinch RodeoHouston Super Shootout, inviting the champions from the top 10 rodeos in North America to compete in bull riding, saddle-bronc and bareback riding, and barrel racing.  Two of the rodeos represented, the Calgary Stampede and the Ponoka Stampede, were also non-PRCA sanctioned invitational rodeos.   Total attendance in 2011 topped 2.26 million, an increase of almost 119,000 people over 2010.
In 2019 & 2020 and resuming in 2022, RodeoHouston has been sanctioned by the PRCA again. The Super Series is PRCA-sanctioned and money won here by contestants counts toward the world standings for the National Finals Rodeo. However, the Super Shootout was unsanctioned and money won here did not count toward the PRCA world standings. Also in 2019, RodeoHouston won the PRCA Large Indoor Rodeo of the Year Award.
On March 11, 2020 after running for 8 of 20 planned days, the rodeo was shut down by the city of Houston after evidence emerged of community spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The Montgomery County constable deputy in his 40s who tested positive for COVID-19 had attended a barbeque cookoff at the rodeo. The man was hospitalized and at least 18 rodeo attendees tested positive for coronavirus, though it is unclear whether they all contracted it at the event. It was the only time in the event's history the rodeo got shut down.
The 2021 edition of the rodeo was originally rescheduled to May due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but after several weeks, it was cancelled altogether, making it the event's first cancellation in 84 years, with the 89th edition instead being deferred to 2022.
In the 2022 spring season, the Houston rodeo was officially reopened to the public, celebrating its second-highest attended record since 2017, with over 2.4 million reported guests in attendance.  An official 2023 season was announced.
It was announced that as of 2023, the Super Shootout would no longer be a part of the rodeo.

Events
Rodeo Uncorked! RoundUp and Best Bites Competition
Almost 3,000 bottles of wine are submitted each year for judging in the Rodeo International Wine Competition.  High scoring wines are served to the public at the Rodeo Uncorked! RoundUp and Best Bites Competition before the HLSR begins. More than 5,000 people purchase tickets to attend the event. There, they can sample food from more than 100 local restaurants and vote on their pick for tastiest food.
During the livestock show, attendees can purchase glasses of these wine entries at the Wine Garden, an outdoor area comprising six tents that shelter 30,000 square feet of space. Live music is offered in the Wine Garden area each evening.

Go Texan Day
The unofficial kickoff of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is Go Texan Day. Traditionally held the Friday before the rodeo begins, the day is meant to encourage the Houston community to celebrate Western culture. Houston-area residents are encouraged to wear Western attire, such as jeans, cowboy boots, and cowboy hats. The day is an unofficial holiday, and local school districts and many businesses encourage their students and employees to participate. Writing in The New York Times, journalist Manny Fernandez described Go Texan Day as """"the one day of the year on which people in Houston dress the way people outside Houston think people in Houston dress"".

Trail rides
From 1952 to 2020 & since 2022, traditional trail rides have been a part of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.  As of 2017, there were 13 official trail rides, totaling over 3,000 riders.  The trail rides range in size from a dozen to over one thousand people who ride on horseback or in horse-drawn wagons from various areas of the state to Houston.  They make their way at about 3 miles (4.8 km) per hour, covering up to 17 miles (27 km) each day.  Many of the routes take place in part along major highways and busy city streets, making safety a major concern.
The trail rides last from a few days to three weeks, depending on the distance they cover. Some of the participants are able to join only on weekends or at the end of the trip. The days start very early, and often end with live music or a small celebration. Many riders choose to camp in recreational vehicles rather than in the open. Each morning, they drive their vehicles and horse trailers to the next camping spot, then have a bus or convoy take them back so they can retrace their path on horseback. Participants can bring their own provisions, or, in some cases, purchase meals at a chuck wagon that is also following the trail.
The rides converge at Memorial Park in Houston on Go Texan Day, the Friday before the livestock show and rodeo begins.  The city closes some roads downtown to allow the riders to reach their destination safely. The resulting traffic interruption cause annual complaints from those who work downtown.  The following day, all of the trail riders participate in the parade.

Rodeo Parade and Rodeo Run
The official kickoff of the show is the annual Rodeo Parade. It is held the Saturday before the show begins and runs through downtown Houston.  The parade features members of the 13 trail rides, influential Houstonians, bands, and floats.
Preceding the parade is the annual Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo Run. More than 10,000 people compete annually in 5k and 10k fun runs. All proceeds go to the show's scholarship fund. The run generally begins near Bagby Street and ends at Eleanor Tinsley Park.
When the Rodeo was cancelled in 2021, the fun runs went virtual.

World's Championship Bar-B-Que Contest
The Thursday, Friday, and Saturday before the livestock show begins, the World's Championship Bar-B-Que Contest, established in 1974, is held on the grounds of NRG Park.  It is one of the largest barbecue cookoffs in the United States, but it is not sanctioned by the Kansas City Barbecue Society. More than 250 teams, including a handful from outside of the United States, compete to be named best entry in several categories, including brisket, chicken, and ribs.  The barbecue must be cooked on a wood fire; electric or gas fires are prohibited.
Entries are judged on a 50-point scale, with the most points gained for taste and tenderness, and lesser amounts available for smell and the look and feel of the entry.  Winners are named in each category, and then an overall Grand Champion is named.  Teams can also compete for non-food-related awards, such as cleanest area, most unique pit, and most colorful team.
Each barbecue team has their own tent on the grounds. Many offer their own entertainment, generally cover bands or djs. Entrance into each tents is by invitation only. Many teams sell sponsorships that provide access to their tent, with the money often going to charity. Attendees without an invitation to a specific tent can congregate in one of the three general admission areas, each with its own live entertainment.  A record 264,132 people attended the World's Championship Barbecue Contest in 2013.
The 51st is scheduled for 28 February–2 March 2025.

Rodeo and concert
One of the largest draws for the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is the 20 consecutive evenings of rodeo and concert, held in NRG Stadium. Tickets are relatively inexpensive, averaging about $29 in 2016, and also grant admission to the livestock show and fairgrounds. More than 43,000 season tickets are sold every year, with the remaining seats 30,000 seats available for individual-show sale.  Members of the HLSR are given an opportunity to buy individual tickets before the general public.
RodeoHouston is sanctioned by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA). It offers one of the largest prize purses in North America, over $2 million, which count for the PRCA's National Finals Rodeo. RodeoHouston has received the PRCA Large Indoor Rodeo of the Year award a total of ten times (1991-1996, 1998-1999, 2004, and 2019). It features 280 of the top professional cowboys. They compete in a playoff format, with the ultimate champion in each event earning $50,000. For one day, contestants compete in the RodeoHouston SuperShootout. Champions from each of the top 10 rodeos in North America are invited to compete as teams in a subset of rodeo events. In 2020 & since 2022, the entire rodeo has been televised live on The Cowboy Channel.
After the professional rodeo concludes, children are given an opportunity to compete. Each evening, 30 high school students from across the state compete in the calf scramble. They are given the opportunity to chase down (on foot) and catch one of 15 calves, put a halter on them, and drag them back to the center of the stadium. Winners are given money to purchase their own heifer or steer to show the following year. Immediately following the calf scramble is mutton busting. Five- and six-year-olds wearing protective gear try to ride a sheep across a portion of the arena. On the last night of the rodeo, the winners from each of the previous evenings compete again to see who will become grand champion.
A rotating stage is then brought into the arena for the nightly concert. The majority of evenings are performances by Country music artists, although some nights are dedicated to Pop, Hip-hop/R&B, and Rock music. The annual Go Tejano Day, which features Regional Mexican artists, generally draws the largest crowds. The winner of the annual Mariachi Invitational competition is invited to perform onstage with the Go Tejano Day act.

Grounds
Visitors who are not attending the rodeo and concert can purchase a lower-cost general admission ticket to gain access to all of NRG Park except the stadium.
According to livestock show CEO Joel Cowley, ""if we can draw people here for a concert or a carnival or a rodeo and teach them something about agriculture, it’s a win in regard to our mission.""  NRG Center contains AgVenture, which provides educational displays about agriculture and the origins of the food for sale at grocery stores.  More than 61,000 school children visited AgVenture in 2015 on official tours.  Displays include an area where attendees can see cows, pigs, and sheep give birth or see chickens hatch.  There are also displays with live rabbits and honeybees.  NRG Center also hosts a large vendor area.
The grounds feature an area where children can do pretend farm chores and compete in races using pedal-driven tractors. There is also a petting zoo, pony and camel rides, and a full carnival and midway.  
Other competitions are held throughout the three weeks at NRG Center and NRG Arena. These include open cattle shows and a paint horse competition. Children with mental and physical disabilities are invited to compete in the Lil' Rustlers Rodeo, which offers imitation rodeo events, such as riding a stick horse.
Free educational seminars are available throughout the three weeks of the livestock show. They are open to the public and cover topic related to wildlife, agricultural in general, and farming and hunting.
Adults can visit The Hideout, a temporary dance hall located in a large tent near NRG Arena. After the show in NRG Stadium concludes, The Hideout features live music from new artists. Several past performers at The Hideout, including the Dixie Chicks, Blake Shelton, Keith Urban, and the Eli Young Band, later became headliners at the main rodeo show. Approximately 2,000-3,000 people visit The Hideout each evening.

Livestock show
HLSR is the largest indoor livestock show in the world. For a full week, cattle auctions are held in NRG Arena for professional breeders to sell their stock. The livestock show has a larger international presence than any other. In 2017, the Ministers of Agriculture from Russia and Colombia made official visits to HLSR, joining more than 2,600 other international businessmen representing 88 countries. The HLSR International Committee estimated that they facilitated more than $2.6 million in agriculture sales between livestock show participants and international visitors in 2016.
Junior market auctions are also held. Children from around the state show the livestock that they have raised, including cattle, market barrow, market goats, market lambs, market broilers, market turkeys, and rabbits. The livestock are judged, with the winners auctioned off.  It is the largest set of animals to be shown and judged of any livestock show.  Most champion animals sell for well over market value.  Winning children are guaranteed a certain amount of scholarship money; if the bid is larger than that amount, the excess funds are directed to the general scholarship fund. The 2024 Livestock and Horse Show competitions drew 37,510 entries, with junior auction sales totaling $26,198,052.

Impact
HLSR is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization and ranks as the 7th-largest Better Business Bureau accredited charity in Houston.  Its primary source of revenue is an annual livestock show and rodeo and the events leading up to it. HLSR has 85 full-time employees and over 35,000 volunteers, divided into 109 committees. Volunteers provide over 2.1 million hours (about 239 and a half years) of service, representing a total of $51 million dollars. All of them are required to pay a minimum fee of $50, and some committees require a larger donation. The most popular committees have a wait list.
In 2024, the total attendance for the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo was 2.5 million people, with the overall total attendance record being over 2.6 million in 2017. It is the largest cultural event in Houston, and its attendance numbers dwarf those of annual attendance for most professional sports teams and most major cultural events in other cities. In comparison, New Orleans' Mardi Gras generally draws about 1.4 million visitors.
In 2024, the organization reported operating revenue of $223,676,691.  The Corral Club, which covers the sale of much of the alcohol on the grounds, but not that within the stadium, sold more alcohol in the three weeks of the HLSR than any other mixed-beverage permit holder in the state for the month of March 2016, and in the year prior was only outsold by the stadium where the Dallas Cowboys play.
A 2010 economic impact analysis estimate that the HLSR funneled $220 million into the Houston economy, with almost half of that coming from visitors outside of the Houston metro region. HLSR and its suppliers and vendors paid over $27 million in taxes to local entities. The study's author estimates that by 2017, the HLSR would be contributing almost $500 million to the local economy each year, the equivalent of hosting the Super Bowl every year.
HLSR awarded $26.07 million in scholarships, grants, and graduate assistantships in 2017. More than 750 students received scholarships, many of them worth $20,000 over four years. Recipients can pursue any field of study but are required to attend a university or college in Texas. Eleven different colleges were awarded funds to pay for graduate assistants. The remainder of the money was allocated for grants to other nonprofits or educational facilities to provide programs to help educate youth about agriculture or pioneer heritage.  Since 1932, HLSR boasts that it has given away over $430 million.

The festival's main components are: Thunder Over Louisville, the largest annual fireworks display in North America; the Great Steamboat Race, featuring the Belle of Louisville and the Pegasus Parade.

History
The Kentucky Derby Festival Association started the first week-long festival in 1935, including a parade, a riverfront regatta and an orchestral concert.  The first director was Olympic gold medalist Arnold Jackson. In 1937, a Derby Festival king and queen were crowned, marking the start of this tradition.  After the floods of 1937, the festival was discontinued and it was not until 1956 when the modern-day Kentucky Derby Festival was reborn. In 2020, the festival was cancelled due to COVID-19, the first such cancellation since 1938.
In 1962 Tom ""Cactus"" Brooks received the first Kentucky Derby Festival Silver Horseshoe Award, ""given to a person who had made a difference in the community and in youth development"".

Official events
The Royal Court
The Royal Court is among the oldest traditions of the Kentucky Derby Festival tradition, dating back to the 1950s by The Fillies, Inc. The Royal Court consists of a group of five young women chosen to preside over events related to the Kentucky Derby. These women officially represent both the Derby Festival and the city of Louisville. In January, a court of Derby Princesses is selected from a pool of more than 1000 applicants. Thirty finalists are selected and the pool is then reduced to five young women who make up the court. Criteria for the selection of the court members includes knowledge of the Derby Festival, poise, intelligence, personality, academic excellence and campus/community involvement.
The court attends nearly 70 events during the two-week period leading up to the Kentucky Derby. The queen is selected by a spin of the wheel at the Annual Fillies Derby Ball. The festival saw this method of queen selections as the most fair way to select from their court and the tradition continues today. Each member of the court is awarded a $2000 scholarship, an entire wardrobe for the festival, VIP access to all events and a chauffeur for the entire two weeks of the official Kentucky Derby Festival.

Thunder Over Louisville
The festival's first major event is Thunder Over Louisville. Thunder kicks off with a day-long air show and one of the largest fireworks displays in North America.

Fest-A-Ville
During the festival, much of Waterfront Park is billed as ""Fest-A-Ville"". It hosts a number of events, including the Chow Wagon, rides, and concerts.

Poster
Each year, an official Derby Festival poster is unveiled and prints are sold to help finance festival events.

Pegasus Parade
The first event held by KDF was the 1956 Pegasus Parade. The parade is held annually on the Thursday before Derby.
NBC Today Show weatherman Willard Scott was the host of WAVE TV's broadcast coverage of the Pegasus Parade from 1982 through 2005.

Sports
Various sport competitions are held as part of the Festival, including the Derby Festival Volleyball Classic. From 1973 to 2017, the Festival hosted the Derby Festival Basketball Classic. Since 1974, a pro-am golf tournament has been held.

Races
A number of races take place in the festival. The Kentucky Derby Festival miniMarathon and Marathon occur the Saturday before the Kentucky Derby. The mini has been held since 1974. That same Saturday is typically also when the Great Balloon Race is held, the culmination of the hot air balloon-themed BalloonFest.
Recognition is given to Louisville's restaurant employees with the Run for the Rosé, where waiters and waitresses run an obstacle course while carrying trays of glasses filled with wine.
For the annual bed races, businesses create themed mobile beds that are paraded before being race on an indoor track with costumed employees. The Great Steamboat Race usually takes place in the week before Derby, where the Belle of Louisville typically takes on at least one challenger.

Miscellaneous
Since 1997, a spelling bee has been held for the festival.

Pegasus pins
Since 1973, KDF has sold a plastic pin for the Kentucky Derby featuring a pegasus. The pin is used as proof of purchase for admission to a number of the KDF events.

Derby cruising
A controversial aspect of the Derby Festival is ""Derby Cruising."" Though it is not an official or licensed event during Derby Festival, it takes place in the historically black areas of West Broadway on Derby day and the Friday before it. Cruising consists of motorcycles and cars (many elaborately modified) driving slowly down Broadway, pedestrians crowding the sidewalks, and several blocks closed for a festival with rides and street vendors. The gridlock associated with cruising made it difficult for police to respond to instances of violence during 2005 Derby cruising. In 2006, police made an effort to stop cruising, shutting down Broadway except to emergency vehicles, which resulted in suggestions of racial profiling and much public debate about the legitimacy of Broadway cruising as a free alternative to other festivities.
In 2007, police announced similar plans, although slightly more of Broadway was to remain open, including access to Shawnee Park. The 2007 plan sparked a lawsuit by business owners and a civil rights foundation, claiming the shutdown of Broadway during Derby week violated their constitutional rights and cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars in business. A federal judge allowed the plans to proceed, citing concerns about ""public safety and the free flow of traffic"".
In 2008, police again banned cruising, but with a new plan allowing traffic to flow but to have a high number of officers on hand to enforce the city's noise and cruising ordinances, the latter of which prevents vehicles from blocking a roadway. Police reported that arrests were down from 2007, although they did shut down a 10-block portion of Broadway for a short time on Derby evening after gridlock developed.

First held in 1924, it is one of the oldest civic celebrations in the Commonwealth of Virginia.

History
The festival was first held Saturday, May 3, 1924, and was originally celebrated as a one-day event (although not held in 1942–1945 due to World War II). Features include a Grand Feature Parade, Firefighters' Parade (first held on Thursday, April 18, 1929), a carnival and midway, luncheons, races, walks, dances and concerts, as well as a field show competition which formerly gave out the Queen's Cup trophy to the winner (although the trophy was retired in 1977, by Princess Anne High School of Virginia Beach, Virginia after winning the competition three straight years). The Queen, Queen Shenandoah, has been crowned every year at John Handley High School (with the exception of 2007, due to ongoing renovations), starting with the original Queen, Elizabeth Steck (Arthur).
A loss of interest during the 1930s, prompted the appointment of Tom Baldridge to the seat of Executive Director of the festival. He was also employed at MGM in the publicity department, which allowed him the opportunity to schedule celebrities, in turn renewing public interest in the festival. The period of the 1960s and 1970s introduced various new aspects to the festival including: the first visit by a U.S. President, Lyndon B. Johnson (1964), the beginning of attendance by sports celebrities Jack Dempsey (1965), and the premier of Sunday in the Park (1975). The Cole Brothers Circus of the Stars, still a favorite of children, first appeared at the festival in 1981.

The festival today
The festival is run by the private Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival organization and attracts over 250,000 people. Highlights include the Old Town Wine & Fine Arts Festival and the Apple Blossom Carnival.
The festival is known for its many guest celebrities and events. During the spring, in preparation for the festival, the citizens of Winchester hold an annual clean-up, followed by decoration of the city in green, pink and white (festival colors), in order to make Winchester more presentable for its anticipated guests.
On March 17, 2020 it was announced that planning for the 2020 festival was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, effectively cancelling the event for that year.
The festival was held in 2021 with the theme “Back in Bloom.” Offering 21 events, this 2021 festival was condensed when compared with earlier instances of the festival, which generally presented more than twice that number of events. Restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic were in place for the 2021 festival, such as the requirement that a maximum of 900 people attend the Apple Blossom Carnival at any one time.

Beale Street Music Festival (BSMF)
About
The Beale Street Music Festival is a three-day music festival that has both a mix of big-name stars and local musical acts. Held during the first weekend of May in the city's Tom Lee Park at the foot of Beale Street, it is considered to be the kick-off event of the entire Memphis in May International Festival celebration. It typically hosts over 100,000 people during the weekend. The Beale Street Music Festival is the only program that has been held every year since the inception of Memphis in May in 1977. Its history can be traced back to the 1800s, when African-American musicians throughout the South would come to Beale Street and perform.

Past Performers
The Beale Street Music Festival is known for featuring an eclectic mix of genres on its lineup every year, from blues and rock 'n roll to rap and pop. The list of bands and musicians that have performed at the festival continue to grow each year, but the list includes Stevie Ray Vaughan, Ray Charles, B.B. King in '91 (d.2015, lived in Memphis), John Lee Hooker in '91, Booker T. and the M.G.'s in '99, Jerry Lee Lewis from Memphis in '03, Box Tops from Memphis in '97, Big Star in '99, Fuel from the Jackson, TN area in '04, Saliva from Memphis in '04, Willie Nelson, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Al Green in '09 (now a preacher in Memphis), Isaac Hayes from Memphis in '00 (d.2008), John Prine, James Brown, Bob Dylan, Black Crowes, Van Morrison, Dave Matthews Band, Widespread Panic, Foo Fighters, The Killers, Snoop Dogg, Kid Rock, John Mayer, Journey, Nelly, Steely Dan, Allman Brothers, Santana, James Taylor, Bobby ""Blue"" Bland, Korn, The Avett Brothers, Mumford & Sons, Kings of Leon from Nashville in '17, Paramore from Nashville in '15, 10 Years from Knoxville in '06, Soundgarden, Wiz Khalifa, Jane's Addiction, Chuck Berry, The Black Keys, Avenged Sevenfold, Alabama Shakes, Lenny Kravitz, Ed Sheeran, Neil Young, Beck, Paul Simon, Ziggy Marley, Sturgill Simpson, Aretha Franklin in '09 (d.2018, born in Memphis), Earth, Wind & Fire in '10 (Maurice White was born in Memphis and d.2016), Yo Gotti in '16, Three 6 Mafia (from Memphis) in '06, Weezer, and many more.
Many of the festival's best known performers were immortalized in portraits by iconic Memphis painter George Hunt, who produced the Beale Street Music Festival's commemorative poster art for 28 years before his passing in December 2020.

International Week
Every year the festival recognizes a different country, most recently saluting Ghana in 2022. A week of events that typically begin the day after the Beale Street Music Fest, International Week is dedicated to a country and showcases the foods and culture of that nation. While International Week provides a learning experience for the community at large, the core is a comprehensive educational program for area youth in public and private schools throughout Memphis and Shelby County. The goal of International Week is for area students, by the time they graduate from high school, to have had the opportunity to experience the customs and cultures of 12 countries. Three of the festival's honored countries — Japan, Canada, and the Netherlands – have been featured twice.
Perhaps most important are the trade delegates that visit Memphis and have introductions to suitable, high-level trade partners.

Honored countries
Through the years, the Memphis in May International Festival has played host to ambassadors, exhibits and performance troupes from 38 countries. The milestone twentieth annual event in 1996 honored all previous selected countries. The 2019 event honored the bicentennials of the founding of the city of Memphis and of the establishment of Shelby County. Festivities were cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Malaysia has been selected as the focus for 2023.

World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest (WCBCC)
History
The WCBCC started in 1978 with 26 teams. The contest drew 50 teams in 1979, 80 in 1980, and 180 teams from nine states in 1981. It has now grown to be the largest pork barbecue competition in the world.
More than 250 teams from 20+ states and several countries compete, and an estimated 100,000 people attend the competition. Media from around the world, including BBC and The Food Network, come to the city to cover the event.
Credit for the original idea of a barbecue contest goes to Rodney Baber, chairman of the Memphis in May events committee in 1977, and his co-worker Jack Powell, Tennessee's reigning chili champ at the time.
The original champion at the first competition was Bessie Louise Cathey, who won a $500 prize, a sizable return for her $12 entry fee. Today, the prizes for each event range from $300 to $15,000 for the main cooking competition, and from $250 to $2,500 for the ancillary contests. Today's entry fees range from $700 to $2,600 just for renting the necessary booth space, and an extra $60 per competition entry. Some teams regularly budget amounts in excess of $15,000 just for the competition and booth.
In 1989, when MIM officials discovered that there was a feast in Honolulu which earned the title of ""largest barbecue"" in the Guinness Book of Records, they calculated the amount of food prepared at the WCBCC. The total was 55,297 pounds of pork, and thus earned the WCBCC a record in the 1990 edition. Over 16 tons of pork were smoked at the 2016 WCBCC.
The 2017 World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest was the first time the event spanned four days instead of three. In addition, the Big Bob Gibson Bar-B-Q team became the first five-time champion of the event (2017, '14, '11, '03, '00).
No contests were held in 2020-21.

Food events
The competition has three official meat categories: rib, shoulder and whole hog.

It is a celebration of the heritage of Fort Wayne, established during the French and Indian War at the confluence of three rivers: the Maumee, St. Marys, and St. Joseph.

History
At the first Three Rivers Festival in 1969, an estimated 100,000 people attended a grand parade and 60 events on the Columbia Street Landing.
The 1973 edition attracted one million visitors. Among the highlights was an air show by the Navy's Blue Angels. In 1976, the festival included an international beer can collectors convention. That year, attendance topped 2 million. In 1977, the festival added fireworks for the first time. That edition's opening day parade was the second largest in the state. The opening of the 1979 festival was marked by 700 balloons released from the top of a city building.
By 1980, the festival had grown to 206 events across Fort Wayne. The following year, the festival introduced a children's parade and attempted to set a record for the World's Longest Hot Dog, at 527 feet (160.6 m) long. In 1980 the festival featured the World's Biggest Pretzel at 10 feet (3.0 m) in diameter.
In 1991, a $20,000 Arts United grant expanded Sunday in the Park to art events at Seniors Day and the Children's Festival. By 1999, the Art in the Park was expanded to include Main Street, featuring a juried show of 85 national artists. That same year, the Three Rivers Festival had a crowd of 500,000, maintaining its position as the second-largest event in Indiana.
In 2021, the festival held its inaugural drag show. The two-hour event featured Fort Wayne local, Della Licious.
In February 2025, it was announced that the 2025 festival would be cancelled as the owners filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after the festival's boarding ultimately decided to begin bankruptcy proceedings.

Events
The Three Rivers Festival events are centered in Headwaters Park in downtown Fort Wayne, Indiana.

Art In The Park
Art in the Park takes place on the first weekend of the festival. It includes a juried fine arts show and sale, located on Freimann Square, Main Street and Barr Street. Over 100 artists from across the country sell oils, watercolors, photography, sculpture, pottery, and more.

Opening Day Parade
The two-hour parade starts in the West Central neighborhood and winds through downtown Fort Wayne. A local musical group typically opens the parade with the national anthem, followed by many parade units, area high school marching bands, local celebrities, and approximately 100 other entries.

Fireworks Finale
The finale of the festival is a fireworks show, noted as one of Northeast Indiana's largest pyrotechnic show.

Financial Background & Sponsors
Three Rivers Festival is a 501(c)4 not-for-profit organization founded in 1969, and funded entirely by vendor participation fees, souvenir sales, refreshment sales, entertainment ticket sales, and the sponsorship and support of area businesses.
The Festival Title sponsor for the 2009 and 2010 editions was Fort Wayne Newspapers. PNC, Sweetwater and STAR 88.3 were other major sponsors in 2010, with National Serv-all sponsoring the edition's Fireworks Finale.

The festival is held every year around October 1 on a Sunday on which the Cleveland Browns either have an away game or are not playing. It is touted as the largest one-day festival in Ohio, with attendance over 100,000.

History
The festival is the brainchild of the late Dick Goddard, the former long-time weatherman at Cleveland's WJW-TV. The Woolly Bear Caterpillar is similarly celebrated for its mythical association to winter forecasting. After the caterpillars' eggs hatch in fall, folklore suggests the severity of an upcoming winter can be gauged by observing the amount of black versus orange in the caterpillars' bands.
Attracting 2,000 spectators in the first year, the number grew to an estimated 15,000 by the eighth festival and quickly overwhelmed the town of Birmingham. Of the 13 cities that expressed interest, organizers selected Vermilion as the new home.
The ""Woollybear 500"" is a comedic race  that starts off with Vermilion's police and fire chiefs selecting woollybears to race. The woollybears are obtained by the Vermilion Chamber and details of the training and skills of said woollybears are not divulged to the participants. The race is monitored by professionals from TV-8. No woollybears are harmed in the making of these races.
The 2020 Woollybear Festival was the first since the event's inception not to be held because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

When the Ms. International competition was hosted, until 2013, it was the second-most-prestigious event in professional female bodybuilding (after Ms. Olympia).

History
A lucrative sports competition, the ASF offers a number of large prizes. Most notably, first prize in bodybuilding consists of a $130,000 check, a Hummer vehicle, and an Audemars Piguet watch. Since the Mr. Olympia bodybuilding title pre-dates and offers higher prize money than the ASF, a rivalry in prestige and popularity has sprung up. The ASF is always hotly contested, often with one or two competition points separating the winners.
All-star cheerleading competitions span a two-day period (usually all day Saturday, and to midday Sunday). More than 4,000 competitors entered the cheerleading event in 2014. Each team (of 15–30 cheerleaders) prepares to perform a two and one-half minute routine. After the teams' routines are complete, they are scored by a panel of judges, each judge being an expert on one area of cheerleading (jumps, tumbling, stunting, etc.). Once scoring is complete, every team entered in the competition is called to the mat for awards, during which each team has a chance of winning multiple times. The ASF's awards consist of the following: National Champion jackets, trophies for every team, custom medals, limited edition patches and Grand Champion banners, and possible partial or full paid bid to Cheerleading World contests.
On June 7, 2013, the ASF's event promoter, Jim Lorimer, announced that from 2014 on, the ASF's ""212"" (a professional, men's bodybuilding division) would permanently replace the Ms. International women's bodybuilding competition. Lorimer, in a statement, said ""The Arnold Sports Festival was proud to support women's bodybuilding through the Ms. International for the past quarter century, but in keeping with demands of our fans, the time has come to introduce the Arnold Classic 212 beginning in 2014. We are excited to create a professional competitive platform for some of the IFBB Pro League's most popular competitors.""
On March 3, 2020 Ohio governor Mike DeWine cancelled most of the Arnold Sports Festival due to the oncoming COVID-19 pandemic in Ohio, before any cases or deaths had been reported. The cancellation was widely regarded as 'radical' at the time.

Curiosities
Arnold Classic Ohio is the largest multi-sport championship in the world, ahead of even the Olympics.
There are around 20,000 athletes from more than 80 countries competing in 60 sports, while the 2024 Olympic Games brought almost 11,000 athletes in 32 sports and 48 disciplines. The Arnold is second only to the number of countries: 206 at the Olympics.
The event also promotes several amateur sports for fans to learn about and practice.
The Arnold Classic Ohio is the second most prestigious event in professional bodybuilding, behind only the Mr. Olympia.
Jim Lorimer, who founded the Arnold Classic with Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1989, was a special agent for the FBI.
Like Arnold, Lorimer ventured into politics, becoming mayor of Worthington, Ohio.
The biggest Arnold Classic Ohio champion is a woman, Iris Kyle (USA), with 7 titles (interestingly, she is also the biggest Mr. Olympia winner, with 11 titles). Among men, Dexter Jackson (USA) is the biggest winner with 5 titles.

History
United States Army veteran Burton Ervin, considered the father of Bridge Day, jumped from the New River Gorge Bridge on August 17, 1979 at 10:20 p.m. with over 200 spectators in attendance. There is a plaque at the bridge commemorating the event.

BASE jumping
Bridge Day is the only day of the year people are allowed to BASE jump off the bridge into the New River Gorge 876 feet (267 meters) below, one of the few exceptions to a general ban on BASE jumping within the U.S. National Park System. People are also allowed to rappel from the span on Bridge Day.  About four hundred BASE jumpers participate in each year's festival. In 2015 the BASE jumping community boycotted the event.
There have been three deaths and a wingsuit accident during Bridge Day involving BASE jumpers:

In 1983, Michael Glenn Williams from Birmingham, Alabama, drowned when his gear was caught in the current after he made a successful jump. The one rescue boat that was in the river at the time was busy with other jumpers, and could not make it to him. In later years, more than one rescue boat was always used, and parachutists were not allowed to jump until it was confirmed that one of the rescue boats was available.
In 1987, Steven Gyrsting of Paoli, Pennsylvania, jumped using gear that was not BASE-specific gear and was killed after he was unable to open his reserve chute in time when his main chute failed to deploy.
During the 2006 festival, Brian Lee Schubert died when he failed to deploy his parachute in time.  In 1966, he had been one of the first to BASE jump from El Capitan in Yosemite National Park.
In 2011, Christopher Brewer of Pensacola, Florida, jumped wearing a wingsuit and survived after failing to open his parachute in time. He was fully conscious and paralyzed after landing in the New River, 876 feet below.

Rappelling
Rappelling off the bottom of the bridge has been part of the Bridge Day festivities since 1981.

Bungee jumping
The first confirmed bungee jumper was stunt performer Skip Stanley also known as ""Blue Bandit"" who leapt from the bridge during the 1985 Bridge Day. In 1992, New Zealander Chris Allum, bungee jumped 823 ft (251 m) from the bridge to set a world's record for the longest bungee jump from a fixed structure, stopping about 40 feet above the river. Also in 1992 a GMC Jimmy SUV was dropped on a bungee for a commercial. In 1993, Chris Allum bungee with six friends in a basket setting a world record for most people in a single bungee jump. However, considerable amount of time required for a bungee jumpers to be reel back up, in which time BASE jumpers are not allowed to jump, prompted the banning of bungee jumping at Bridge Day since 1994.

The National Storytelling Festival was founded by Jimmy Neil Smith, a high school journalism teacher, in 1973.  It has grown over the years to become a major festival both in the United States and internationally.

History
In 1973, Jimmy Neil Smith, a high school journalism teacher, and a carload of students heard Grand Ole Opry regular Jerry Clower spin a tale over the radio about coon hunting in Mississippi. Smith was inspired by that event to create a story telling festival in Northeast Tennessee.
In October 1973, the first National Storytelling Festival was held in Jonesborough, Tennessee. Hay bales and wagons were the stages, and audience and tellers together didn't number more than 60.
Two years after the first festival, Smith founded the National Association for the Preservation and Perpetuation of Storytelling (NAPPS), an organization that led America's storytelling renaissance.  In 1994, the name of the organization was shortened to the National Storytelling Association (NSA). Another name change occurred in 1998, when NSA ""divided into two separate organizations, National Storytelling Network (NSN) and International Storytelling Center (ISC)"". Today, the ISC promotes the power of storytelling and the creative applications of this ancient tradition to enrich the human experience in the home, at the workplace, and throughout the world. The National Storytelling Network is a membership organization, ""connecting people to and through storytelling"".

The Festival
Produced by the International Storytelling Center, the three-day outdoor festival features performances by internationally known artists.  In existence for almost 50 years, the Festival attracts nearly 11,000 audience members annually, including school groups whose students attend as an educational experience.
The festival builds on the Appalachian cultural tradition of storytelling. Held under circus tents scattered throughout Jonesborough, storytellers sit on stages or at the head of the tent to perform. There are usually five or six tents in close proximity so that festival goers can easily walk from tent to tent and from performance to performance.
Past storytellers include Pete Seeger, Carmen Agra Deedy, Jay O'Callahan, Donald Davis, Syd Lieberman, Andy Offutt Irwin, Sheila Kay Adams, and Kathryn Tucker Windham. The festival has expanded to include the growing ranks of Youth Storytellers, including showcasing participants and winners of the National Youth Storytelling Showcase. The festival influenced the development of a storytelling graduate degree program at the nearby East Tennessee State University.

A board of community volunteers and local/regional storytellers makes up the 503(c) non-profit organization that is responsible for organizing and overseeing the festival.

History
The history of storytelling in southern Ohio extends back to the Native Americans. The Shawnee and Mingo tribes that inhabited southern Ohio maintained their history through stories passed down from generation to generation. The pioneers who established communities in the same area brought with them the stories of their ancestors even as they created their own. The travelers, and those who helped them, along the Underground Railroad encouraged one another with their stories of hope as they passed through the southern Ohio area.
Bill McKell, a local storyteller and business leader, visited both the National Storytelling Festival and, later, a regional storytelling festival in Kentucky with his family.  With no other festivals in the Ohio area, Bill McKell spearheaded a committee of local volunteers and storytelling organizations that developed plans and secured grants and donations to hold the first Southern Ohio Storytelling Festival in Chillicothe, the historic first-capital of Ohio, in 2004.
Various venues have been used over the years, in addition to the historic Majestic Theatre, to accommodate thousands of school children that attend the festival.  The locations have included the Stevenson Center library, Bennett Hall auditorium and the Shoemaker Center gymnasium at the Ohio University-Chillicothe Branch, a tent at the Pump House Art Gallery in Yoctangee Park, 30 East Main Street, the J.A. Smith Middle School auditorium, local school libraries/gymnasiums/auditoriums and a tent in the courtyard of the Majestic Theatre.
There was no festival in 2020.

The festival
The festival begins on Thursday evening with a ""meet the storytellers"" reception that is open to the public and includes a concert that previews each of the festival's storytellers.  Thousands of students participate during the day on Friday. Students around the state of Ohio also participate through the videoconferencing network provided by the South Central Ohio Computer Association.  Ghost stories were added in 2009 and have been held on Friday evenings in the historic Majestic Theatre.
Past performers include Bill Harley, Carmen Agra Deedy, Donald Davis, Elizabeth Ellis, Connie Regan-Blake, Sheila Kay Adams, Bobby Norfolk, Bil Lepp, Antonio Rocha, Len Cabral, Kate Long, Lyn Ford, Kevin Cordi, Bill Harley, Andy Offutt Irwin and Jim Flanagan.  Participants are encouraged to share their own stories with an open microphone during Saturday's schedule.

Festival origins
In 1989, Karen Jackman Ashton, President of the Friends of the Orem Public Library, was looking for projects to promote community involvement in the Library. Ashton has been volunteering at the Library for years, presenting Storytime for preschoolers and helping with other Children's Library programs. When she saw an advertisement for a National Storytelling Festival in Tennessee, she decided to attend and gather more ideas for stories and programs for the Orem Library.
She went to the National Festival expecting to find ladies telling stories to children in a library. Instead, she found thousands of adults crowding into tents, listening to dynamic performers relating tales of history, culture, folk, and family life, as well as magical stories of “what if . . .!” The entire town of Jonesborough (population 3,000) had mobilized to accommodate the 10,000+ people who annually attend the three-day festival.
Ashton recognized in the storytelling festival the idea she was searching for and The Friends launched the first Timpanogos Storytelling Festival just eight months after Ashton presented the idea. The Ashton family opened their home to the community, set up performance areas on their property, and persuaded neighbors to do the same. Three Eastern storytellers of national fame and local talent including James Arrington, Marvin Payne, and Gaye Beeson performed for two days.
News of the festival spread rapidly. By the second year, the Friends had expanded the hours of the festival, planned an additional evening performance at the Scera Theater, borrowed another field for a fourth performance tent, and invited school groups to the Friday morning performances. Five of the best storytellers in the nation were on the program, and auditions had been held to determine the successful regional tellers. Acoustic musicians performed during the intermissions throughout the day, supplementing performances by storytellers on the fiddle, banjo, harmonica, and spoons.

Expansion and growth
The Timpanogos Storytelling Festival has grown each year—in both audience size and prestige. Attendance at annual festival events total 26,000 and the festival is recognized throughout the national storytelling world as a standard setter. The festival and its organizers have received national media attention and awards. Storytelling event organizers from around the nation attend the Timpanogos Festival for training. The Timpanogos Storytelling Festival has garnered this reputation not only because of the great talent featured, but also because of the scenic setting, the terrific audience, the extraordinary community support, and its excellence in organization.
In 1999, the National Storytelling Network honored Ashton with the Leadership Award in recognition of her exemplary leadership and significant contributions to the community through storytelling. In the same year, the Utah Storytelling Guild (spawned by the festival and now supporting the Festival) received the National Storytelling Network Service Award. Janet Low, Festival Coordinator, was awarded the Service Award in 2000 and Debi Richan, Festival Vice-President, received this national award in 2004. 
In 2005, the festival opened at the new Mt. Timpanogos Park in Provo Canyon.  Designed by the City of Orem for the annual festival, the park allows festival growth to continue with more and larger performance tents.
The Timpanogos Storytelling Festival has been supported with volunteer work and donations from individuals and community groups such as the American Legion, Kiwanis, Golden Kiwanis, youth groups, student clubs, the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, and the Utah Storytelling Guild.
In 2017 the festival moved locations to Thanksgiving Point's Ashton Gardens. A virtual festival was held in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 35th festival will take place on 5-7 September 2024.

The first patent of human transporter was filed in 1994 and granted in 1997, followed by others, including one submitted in June 1999 and granted in October 2001.
Prior to its introduction, a news report about a proposal for a book about the invention, development, and financing of the Segway PT  led to speculation about the device and its importance. John Doerr speculated that it would be more important than the Internet. South Park devoted an episode to making fun of the hype before the product was released. Steve Jobs was quoted as saying that it was ""as big a deal as the PC"", (he later expressed a negative opinion, saying that it ""sucked"", presumably referring to ""the design"" – but also referred to the (presumably high) price point, asking, ""You're sure your market is upscale consumers for transportation?"") The device was unveiled on 3 December 2001, following months of public speculation, in Bryant Park, New York City, on the ABC News morning program Good Morning America, with the first units delivered to customers in early 2002.
The original Segway PT models featured three speed settings: 6 miles per hour (9.7 km/h), 8 miles per hour (13 km/h) with faster turning, and 10 miles per hour (16 km/h). Steering of early versions was controlled using a twist grip that varied the speeds of the two motors. The range of the p-Series was 6–10 miles (9.7–16.1 km) on a fully charged nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery with a recharge time of four to six hours. In September 2003, the Segway PT was recalled, because if users ignored repeated low-battery warnings on the PTs, it could ultimately lead them to fall.
In August 2006, Segway Inc. discontinued all previous models and introduced the i2 and x2 products, which were steered by leaning the handlebars to the right or left, had a maximum speed of 12.5 mph (20.1 km/h) from a pair of two-horsepower (1.5 kW) Brushless DC electric motors with regenerative braking and a range of up to 15–25 mi (24–40 km), depending on terrain, riding style, and state of the batteries. Recharging took eight to ten hours. The i2 and x2 also introduced the wireless InfoKey which could show mileage and a trip odometer, and put the vehicle into security mode, which locked the wheels and set off an alarm if it was moved, and could also be used to turn on the PT from up to 15 feet (4.6 m) away.
Segway Inc. was acquired by British businessman Jimi Heselden from its U.S. inventor Dean Kamen in December 2009. A year later, Heselden died after he ""plunged into the River Wharfe while riding a rugged country version"" of Segway PT.

Versions of the product prior to 2011 included (in order of release):

Segway i167 (2001 revealed, 2002 shipped)
Segway e167: As i167, with addition of electric kickstand
Segway p133: Smaller platform and wheels and less powerful motors than the i and e Series with top speed of 10 miles per hour (16 km/h) in the p-Series
Segway i180: With lithium-ion batteries
Segway XT: The first Segway designed specifically for recreation
Segway i2 (2006): The first on-road Segway PT with LeanSteer
Segway x2 (2006): The first off-road Segway PT with LeanSteer
In March 2014, Segway Inc. announced third generation designs, including the i2 SE and x2 SE sport, new LeanSteer frame and powerbase designs, with integrated lighting.

Subsidiary of Ninebot
Ninebot, a Beijing-based transportation robotics startup and a rival of Segway Inc., acquired Segway Inc. in April 2015, having raised $80M from Xiaomi and Sequoia Capital. The acquisition came months after the U.S. International Trade Commission agreed to investigate Segway Inc.'s claim that Ninebot and other companies were infringing on its patents and copyrights. Segway Inc. requested the blocking of imports of competing scooters into the United States.
In June 2016, Segway Inc. launched the Segway miniPRO, a smaller self-balancing scooter.

End of production
Only 140,000 units were sold during the lifetime of the product, and in the later years the Segway PT only made up 1.5% of total company profit. Factors contributing to the end of production include the price (US$5,000 at launch), and the learning curve in learning to balance on a Segway PT which has led to notable accidents involving Usain Bolt, George W. Bush, Ellen DeGeneres, Ian Healy, and Segway Inc. previous owner Jimi Heselden. While the Segway has remained popular for security and tourism, electric scooters have been more popular for personal mobility.

UTVs
In February 2022, Segway entered the UTV (Utility Terrain Vehicle) market.

Technology
The dynamics of the Segway PT are similar to a classic control problem, the inverted pendulum. It uses brushless DC electric motors in each wheel powered by lithium-ion batteries with balance achieved using tilt sensors, and gyroscopic sensors developed by BAE Systems' Advanced Technology Centre.

Usage
In 2011, the Segway i2 was being marketed to the emergency medical services community.
In 2018, the police of Stockholm adopted Segway i2 as a permanent transportation method for the patrollers of the old town.
The Segway miniPro is also available to be used as the mobility section of a robot.
Disability Rights Advocates for Technology worked to supply Segway PTs to veterans who had trouble walking. (Segway Inc. cannot market its devices in the US as medical devices. Kamen sold the intellectual property rights for medical purposes to Johnson & Johnson, makers of the iBOT, a self-balancing wheelchair.)
The maximum speed of the Segway PT is 12.5 miles per hour (20.1 km/h). The product is capable of covering 24 miles (39 km) on a fully charged lithium-ion battery, depending on terrain, riding style, and the condition of the batteries. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission does not have Segway-specific recommendations but does say that bicycle helmets are adequate for ""low-speed, motor-assisted"" scooters.

History
The first Tall Stacks festival was held in October 1988 as a part of Cincinnati's bicentennial celebration. Fourteen riverboats made appearances in the three-day festival, which included tours of the boats, cruises and races between the rivals Delta Queen and Belle of Louisville — a renewal of their annual race during the Kentucky Derby Festival in Louisville, Kentucky. More than 700,000 people attended.
Subsequent festivals:

1992: The event expanded to four days. Attendance increased to 800,000, which was the largest attendance for any event in Cincinnati until the BLINK Light and Art Festival broke the record in 2019 and again in 2022.
1995: The schedule was moved up a year to prevent a near-conflict with the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. The event expanded to five days and 19 riverboats. The Kentucky cities added a Civil War re-enactment to the festivities and attendance increased again to 850,000, a new record.
1999: Though attendance was down, Tall Stacks '99 drew 660,000 and was named the US's top tourism event by the American Bus Association. Nineteen riverboats again traveled to the festival.

2003: The festival took on its most recent formal name and drew a record 900,000 visitors. ""Theme cruises"" were an added attraction, such as wine tasting cruises, Cincinnati Zoo cruises, and more. Musical acts included Creedence Clearwater Revisited, Lucinda Williams, Emmylou Harris, Shawn Colvin, The Jayhawks, Delbert McClinton, John Hammond, B. B. King, Ricky Skaggs, Mary Chapin Carpenter, and more than 150 other national, regional, and local bands.
2006: 17 riverboats took part in the festival, including the Delta Queen, Belle of Louisville, General Jackson, Natchez, Mississippi Queen and Majestic. On the Newport side of the river at the site of the Newport Barracks, a series of American Civil War displays was established, which taught about military life during this period. The US Army Corps of Engineers had displays about the river.
2009: The event was cancelled due to lack of sponsorship and has not been held since.

History
Origins, development, and spread
The European roots of the United States originate with the English and Spanish settlers of colonial North America during British and Spanish rule. The varieties of English people, as opposed to the other peoples on the British Isles, were the overwhelming majority ethnic group in the 17th century (the population of the colonies in 1700 was 250,000) and were 47.9% of percent of the total population of 3.9 million. They constituted 60% of the whites at the first census in 1790 (%: 3.5 Welsh, 8.5 Scotch Irish, 4.3 Scots, 4.7 Irish, 7.2 German, 2.7 Dutch, 1.7 French, and 2 Swedish). The English ethnic group contributed to the major cultural and social mindset and attitudes that evolved into the American character. Of the total population in each colony, they numbered from 30% in Pennsylvania to 85% in Massachusetts. Large non-English immigrant populations from the 1720s to 1775, such as the Germans (100,000 or more), Scotch Irish (250,000), added enriched and modified the English cultural substrate. The religious outlook was some versions of Protestantism (1.6% of the population comprised English, German, and Irish Catholics).
Jeffersonian democracy was a foundational American cultural innovation, which is still a core part of the country's identity. Thomas Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia was perhaps the first influential domestic cultural critique by an American and was written in reaction to the views of some influential Europeans that America's native flora and fauna (including humans) were degenerate.

Non-indigenous cultural influences have been brought by historical immigration, especially from Germany in much of the country, Ireland and Italy in the Northeast, and Japan in Hawaii. Latin American culture is especially pronounced in former Spanish areas but has also been introduced by immigration, as have Asian American cultures (especially in the Northeast and West Coast regions). Caribbean culture has been increasingly introduced by immigration and is pronounced in many urban areas. Since the abolition of slavery, the Caribbean has been the source of the earliest and largest Black immigrant group, a significant source of growth of the Black population in the U.S. and has made major cultural impacts in education, music, sports and entertainment.
Indigenous cultures remains strong in both reservation and urban communities, including traditional government and communal organization of property now legally managed by Indian reservations (large reservations are mostly in the West, especially Oklahoma, Arizona and South Dakota). The fate of indigenous cultures after contact with Europeans is quite varied. For example, Taíno culture in U.S. Caribbean territories is undergoing cultural revitalization and like many Native American languages, the Taíno language is no longer spoken. By contrast, the Hawaiian language and culture of the Native Hawaiians has survived in Hawaii alongside that of immigrants from the mainland U.S. (starting before the 1898 annexation) and to some degree Asian immigrants. Indigenous Hawaiian influences on mainstream American culture include surfing and Hawaiian shirts. Most languages native to what is now U.S. territory are endangered, and the economic and mainstream cultural dominance of the English language threatens the surviving ones in most places. Some of the most common native languages include Samoan, Hawaiian, Navajo, Cherokee, Sioux, and a spectrum of Inuit languages. (See Indigenous languages of the Americas for a fuller listing, plus Chamorro, and Carolinian in the Pacific territories.) Ethnic Samoans are a majority in American Samoa; Chamorro are still the largest ethnic group in Guam (though a minority), and along with Refaluwasch are smaller minorities in the Northern Mariana Islands.

American culture includes both conservative and liberal elements, scientific and religious competitiveness, political structures, risk taking and free expression, materialist and moral elements. Despite certain consistent ideological principles (e.g. individualism, egalitarianism, and faith in freedom and republicanism), American culture has a variety of expressions due to its geographical scale and demographics.
As a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, the U.S. has been shaped by the world's largest immigrant population. The country is home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values, and exerts major cultural influence on a global scale, with the phenomenon being termed Americanization.

Regional variations
Semi-distinct cultural regions of the United States include New England, the Mid-Atlantic, the South, the Midwest, the Southwest, and the West—an area that can be further subdivided into the Pacific States and the Mountain States.
According to cultural geographer Colin Woodward there are as many as eleven cultural areas of the United States, which spring from their settlement history. In the east, from north to south: there are Puritan areas (""Yankeedom"") of New England which spread across the northern Great Lakes to the northern reaches of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers; the New Netherlands area in the densely populated New York metropolitan area; the Midland area which spread from Pennsylvania to the lower Great Lakes and the trans-Mississippi upper midwest; Greater Appalachia which angles from West Virginia through the lower midwest and upper-south to trans-Mississippi Arkansas, and southern Oklahoma; the Deep South from the Carolinas to Florida and west to Texas. In the west, there is the southwestern ""El Norte"" areas originally colonized by Spain, the ""Left Coast"" colonized quickly on the 19th century by a mix of Yankees and upper Appalachians, and the large but sparsely populated interior West.
The west coast of the continental United States, consisting of California, Oregon, and Washington state, is also sometimes referred to as the Left Coast, indicating its left-leaning political orientation and tendency towards social liberalism.
The South is sometimes informally called the ""Bible Belt"" due to socially conservative evangelical Protestantism, which is a significant part of the region's culture. Christian church attendance across all denominations is generally higher there than the national average. This region is usually contrasted with the mainline Protestantism and Catholicism of the Northeast, the religiously diverse Midwest and Great Lakes, the Mormon Corridor in Utah and southern Idaho, and the relatively secular West. The percentage of non-religious people is the highest in the northeastern and New England state of Vermont at 34%, compared to 6% in the Bible Belt state of Alabama.
Strong cultural differences have a long history in the U.S., with the southern slave society in the antebellum period serving as a prime example. Social and economic tensions between the Northern and Southern states were so severe that they eventually caused the South to declare itself an independent nation, the Confederate States of America; thus initiating the American Civil War.

Languages
Although the United States has no official language at the federal level, 28 states have passed legislation making English the official language, and it is considered to be the de facto national language. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, more than 97% of Americans can speak English well, and for 81%, it is the only language spoken at home. The national dialect is known as American English, which itself consists of numerous regional dialects, but has some shared unifying features that distinguish it from British English and other varieties of English. There are four large dialect regions in the United States—the North, the Midland, the South, and the West—and several dialects more focused within metropolitan areas such as those of New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston. A standard dialect called ""General American"" (analogous in some respects to the received pronunciation elsewhere in the English-speaking world), lacking the distinctive noticeable features of any particular region, is believed by some to exist as well; it is sometimes regionally associated with the Midwest. American Sign Language, used mainly by the deaf, is also native to the United States.
More than 300 languages nationwide, and up to 800 languages in New York City, besides English, have native speakers in the United States—some are spoken by indigenous peoples (about 150 living languages) and others imported by immigrants. English is not the first language of most immigrants in the US, though many do arrive knowing how to speak it, especially from countries where English is broadly used. This not only includes immigrants from countries such as Canada, Jamaica, and the UK, where English is the primary language, but also countries where English is an official language, such as India, Nigeria, and the Philippines.
According to the 2000 census, there were nearly 30 million native speakers of Spanish in the United States. Spanish has official status in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, where it is the primary language spoken, and the state of New Mexico; numerous Spanish enclaves exist around the country as well. Bilingual speakers may use both English and Spanish reasonably well and may code-switch according to their dialog partner or context, a phenomenon known as Spanglish.
Indigenous languages of the United States include the Native-American languages (including Navajo, Yupik, Dakota, and Apache), which are spoken on the country's numerous Indian reservations and at cultural events such as pow wows; Hawaiian, which has official status in the state of Hawaii; Chamorro, which has official status in the commonwealths of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands; Carolinian, which has official status in the commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; and Samoan, which has official status in the commonwealth of American Samoa.

Customs and traditions
Cuisine
The cuisine of the United States is extremely diverse, owing to the vastness of the country, the relatively large population (1⁄3 of a billion people) and the significant number of native and immigrant influences. Mainstream American culinary arts are similar to those in other Western countries. Wheat and corn are the primary cereal grains. Traditional American cuisine uses ingredients such as turkey, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn (maize), squash, and maple syrup, as well as indigenous foods employed by American Indians and early European settlers, African slaves, and their descendants.

Iconic American dishes such as apple pie, donuts, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants and domestic innovations. French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are consumed.The types of food served at home vary greatly and depend upon the region of the country and the family's own cultural heritage. Recent immigrants tend to eat food similar to that of their country of origin, and Americanized versions of these cultural foods, such as Chinese American cuisine or Italian American cuisine often eventually appear. Vietnamese cuisine, Korean cuisine, and Thai cuisine in authentic forms are often readily available in large cities. German cuisine has a profound impact on American cuisine, especially Midwestern cuisine; potatoes, noodles, roasts, stews, cakes, and other pastries are the most iconic ingredients in both cuisines. Dishes such as the hamburger, pot roast, baked ham, and hot dogs are examples of American dishes derived from German cuisine.

Different regions of the United States have their own cuisine and styles of cooking. The states of Louisiana and Mississippi, for example, are known for their Cajun and Creole cooking. Cajun and Creole cooking are influenced by French, Acadian, and Haitian cooking, although the dishes themselves are original and unique. Examples include Crawfish Étouffée, Red beans and rice, seafood or chicken gumbo, jambalaya, and boudin. Italian, German, Hungarian, and Chinese influences, traditional Native American, Caribbean, Mexican, and Greek dishes have also diffused into the general American repertoire. It is not uncommon for a middle-class family from Middle America to eat, for example, restaurant pizza, home-made pizza, enchiladas con carne, chicken paprikash, beef stroganoff, and bratwurst with sauerkraut for dinner throughout a single week.
Soul food, mostly the same as food eaten by white southerners, developed by southern African slaves, and their free descendants, is popular around the South and among many African Americans elsewhere. Syncretic cuisines such as Louisiana Creole, Cajun, Pennsylvania Dutch, and Tex-Mex are regionally important.
Americans generally prefer coffee over tea, and more than half the adult population drinks at least one cup of coffee per day. Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk (now often fat-reduced) ubiquitous breakfast beverages. During the 1980s and 1990s, the caloric intake of Americans rose by 24%; and frequent dining at fast food outlets is associated with what health officials call the American ""obesity epidemic."" Highly sweetened soft drinks are popular; sugared beverages account for 9% of the average American's daily caloric intake.
The American fast food industry, the world's first and largest, is also often viewed as being a symbol of U.S. marketing dominance. Companies such as McDonald's, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Domino's Pizza among others, have numerous outlets around the world, and pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s.

	Some representative American foods

Sports
In the 1800s, colleges were encouraged to focus on intramural sports, particularly track and field, and, in the late 1800s, American football. Physical education was incorporated into primary school curriculums in the 20th century.

Baseball is the oldest of the major American team sports. Professional baseball dates from 1869 and had no close rivals in popularity until the 1960s. Though baseball is no longer the most popular sport, it is still referred to as ""the national pastime."" Also unlike the professional levels of the other popular spectator sports in the U.S., Major League Baseball teams play almost every day. The Major League Baseball regular season consists of each of the 30 teams playing 162 games from late March to early October. The season ends with the postseason and World Series in October. Unlike most other major sports in the country, professional baseball draws most of its players from a ""minor league"" system, rather than from university athletics.

American football, known in the United States as simply ""football"", now attracts more television viewers than any other sport and is considered to be the most popular sport in the United States. The 32-team National Football League (NFL) is the most popular professional American football league.
The National Football League differs from the other three major pro sports leagues in that each of its 32 teams plays one game a week over 18 weeks, for a total of 17 games with one bye week for each team. The NFL season lasts from September to December, ending with the playoffs and Super Bowl in January and February.
Its championship game, the Super Bowl, has often been the highest rated television show, and it has an audience of over 100 million viewers annually.
College football also attracts audiences of millions. Some communities, particularly in rural areas, place great emphasis on their local high school football team. American football games usually include cheerleaders and marching bands, which aim to raise school spirit and entertain the crowd at halftime.
Basketball is another major sport, represented professionally by the National Basketball Association. It was invented in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1891, by Canadian-born physical education teacher James Naismith. College basketball is also popular, due in large part to the NCAA men's Division I basketball tournament in March, colloquially known as ""March Madness"".
Ice hockey is the fourth-leading professional team sport. Always a mainstay of Great Lakes and New England-area culture, the sport gained tenuous footholds in regions like the American South since the early 1990s, as the National Hockey League pursued a policy of expansion.

Lacrosse is a team sport of American and Canadian Native American origin and is most popular on the East Coast. NLL and MLL are the national box and outdoor lacrosse leagues. Many of the top Division I college lacrosse teams draw upwards of 7–10,000 for a game, especially in the Mid-Atlantic and New England areas.
Soccer is very popular as a participation sport, particularly among youth, and the US national teams are competitive internationally. A twenty-six-team (with four more confirmed to be added within the next few years) professional league, Major League Soccer, plays from March to October, but its television audience and overall popularity lag behind other American professional sports.
Other popular sports are tennis, softball, rodeo, swimming, water polo, fencing, shooting sports, hunting, volleyball, skiing, snowboarding, skateboarding, ultimate, disc golf, cycling, MMA, roller derby, wrestling, weightlifting, and rugby.

Relative to other parts of the world, the United States is unusually competitive in women's sports, a fact usually attributed to the Title IX anti-discrimination law, which requires most American colleges to give equal funding to men's and women's sports. Despite that, however, women's sports are not nearly as popular among spectators as men's sports.
The United States enjoys a great deal of success both in the Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics, constantly finishing among the top medal winners.

Sports and community culture
Homecoming is an annual tradition in the United States. People, towns, high schools and colleges come together, usually in late September or early October, to welcome back former residents and alumni. It is built around a central event, such as a banquet, a parade, and most often, a game of American football, or, on occasion, basketball, wrestling or ice hockey. When celebrated by schools, the activities vary. However, they usually consist of a football game, played on the school's home football field, activities for students and alumni, a parade featuring the school's marching band and sports teams, and the coronation of a Homecoming Queen.
American high schools commonly field football, basketball, baseball, softball, volleyball, soccer, golf, swimming, track and field, and cross-country teams as well.

Public holidays
The United States observes holidays derived from events in American history, Christian traditions, and national patriarchs.
Thanksgiving is the principal traditionally-American holiday, evolving from the English Pilgrim's custom of giving thanks for one's welfare. Thanksgiving is generally celebrated as a family reunion with a large afternoon feast. Independence Day (or the Fourth of July) celebrates the anniversary of the country's Declaration of Independence from Great Britain, and is generally observed by parades throughout the day and the shooting of fireworks at night.
Christmas Day, celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ, is widely celebrated and a federal holiday, though a fair amount of its current cultural importance is due to secular reasons. European colonization has led to some other Christian holidays such as Easter and St. Patrick's Day to be observed, though with varying degrees of religious fidelity.
Halloween, also known as All Hallows' Eve, is a holiday of diverse origins. It has become a holiday that is celebrated by children and teens who traditionally dress up in costumes and go door to door trick-or-treating for candy. It also brings about an emphasis on eerie and frightening urban legends and movies. Mardi Gras, which evolved from the Catholic tradition of Carnival, is observed in the state of Louisiana.

Names
The United States has few laws governing given names. Traditionally, the right to name your child or yourself as you choose has been upheld by court rulings and is rooted in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. This freedom, along with the cultural diversity within the United States has given rise to a wide variety of names and naming trends.
Creativity has also long been a part of American naming traditions and names have been used to express personality, cultural identity, and values. Naming trends vary by race, geographic area, and socioeconomic status. African Americans, for instance, have developed a very distinct naming culture. Both religious names and those inspired by popular culture are common.
A few restrictions do exist, varying by state, mostly for the sake of practicality (e.g., limiting the number of characters due to limitations in record-keeping software).

Fashion and dress
Fashion in the United States is eclectic and predominantly informal. While the diverse cultural roots of Americans are reflected in their clothing, particularly those of recent immigrants, cowboy hats and boots, and leather motorcycle jackets are emblematic of specifically-American styles.
Blue jeans were popularized as work clothes in the 1850s by merchant Levi Strauss, a German-Jewish immigrant in San Francisco, and adopted by many American teenagers a century later. They are worn in every state by people of all ages and social classes. Along with mass-marketed informal wear in general, blue jeans are arguably one of US culture's primary contributions to global fashion.
Though the informal dress is more common, certain professionals, such as bankers and lawyers, traditionally dress formally for work, and some occasions, such as weddings, funerals, dances, and some parties, typically call for formal wear. The annual Met Gala in Manhattan is known worldwide as ""fashion's biggest night"".
Some cities and regions have specialties in certain areas. For example, Miami for swimwear, Boston and the general New England area for formal menswear, Los Angeles for casual attire and womenswear, and cities like Seattle and Portland for eco-conscious fashion. Chicago is known for its sportswear, and is the premier fashion destination in the middle American market. Dallas, Houston, Austin, Nashville, and Atlanta are big markets for the fast fashion and cosmetics industries, alongside having their own distinct fashion sense that mainly incorporates cowboy boots and workwear, greater usage of makeup, lighter colors and pastels, ""college prep"" style, sandals, bigger hairstyles, and thinner, airier fabrics due to the heat and humidity of the region.

The nuclear family and family structure
Family arrangements in the United States reflect the nature of contemporary American society. The classic nuclear family is a man and a woman, united in marriage, with one or more biological children. Today, a person may grow up in a single-parent family, go on to marry and live in a childfree couple arrangement, then get divorced, live as a single for a couple of years, remarry, have children and live in a nuclear family arrangement.

Youth dependence
Exceptions to the longstanding American custom of leaving home when one reaches legal adulthood at age eighteen can occur especially among Italian and Hispanic Americans, and in expensive urban real estate markets such as New York City, California, and Honolulu, where monthly rents can be prohibitively high.

Marriage and divorce
Marriage laws are established by individual states. The typical wedding involves a couple proclaiming their commitment to one another in front of their close relatives and friends, often presided over by a religious figure such as a minister, priest, or rabbi, depending upon the faith of the couple. In traditional Christian ceremonies, the bride's father will ""give away"" (handoff) the bride to the groom. Secular weddings are also common, often presided over by a judge, Justice of the Peace, or other municipal officials. Same-sex marriage is legal in all states since June 26, 2015.
Divorce is the province of state governments, so divorce law varies from state to state. Prior to the 1970s, divorcing spouses had to allege that the other spouse was guilty of a crime or sin like abandonment or adultery; when spouses simply could not get along, lawyers were forced to manufacture ""uncontested"" divorces. The no-fault divorce revolution began in 1969 in California; New York and South Dakota were the last states to begin allowing no-fault divorce. No-fault divorce on the grounds of ""irreconcilable differences"" is now available in all states. However, many states have recently required separation periods prior to a formal divorce decree.
State law provides for child support where children are involved, and sometimes for alimony. ""Married adults now divorce two-and-a-half times as often as adults did 20 years ago and four times as often as they did 50 years ago... between 40% and 60% of new marriages will eventually end in divorce. The probability within... the first five years is 20%, and the probability of its ending within the first 10 years is 33%... Perhaps 25% of children (ages 16 and under) live with a stepparent."" The median length for a marriage in the U.S. today is 11 years with 90% of all divorces being settled out of court.

Housing
Historically, Americans mainly lived in a rural environment, with a few important cities of moderate size. The Industrial Revolution brought a period of urbanization accelerated by the GI Bill that incentivized soldiers returning from WWII to purchase a house in the suburbs.
American cities with housing prices near the national median have also been losing the middle income neighborhoods, those with median income between 80% and 120% of the metropolitan area's median household income. Here, the more affluent members of the middle-class, who are also often referred to as being professional or upper-middle-class, have left in search of larger homes in more exclusive suburbs. This trend is largely attributed to the middle-class squeeze, which has caused a starker distinction between the statistical middle class and the more privileged members of the middle class. In more expensive areas such as California, however, another trend has been taking place where an influx of more affluent middle-class households has displaced those in the actual middle of society and converted former American middle-middle-class neighborhoods into upper-middle-class neighborhoods.

Volunteerism
Alexis de Tocqueville first noted, in 1835, the American attitude towards helping others in need. A 2011 Charities Aid Foundation study found that Americans were the first most willing to help a stranger and donate time and money in the world at 60%. Many low-level crimes are punished by assigning hours of ""community service"", a requirement that the offender perform volunteer work; some high schools also require community service to graduate. Since US citizens are required to attend jury duty, they can be jurors in legal proceedings.

Drugs and alcohol
American attitudes towards drugs and alcoholic beverages have evolved considerably throughout the country's history. In the 19th century, alcohol was readily available and consumed, and no laws restricted the use of other drugs. Attitudes on drug addiction started to change, resulting in the Harrison Act, which eventually became proscriptive.
A movement to ban alcoholic beverages called the Temperance movement, emerged in the late 19th century. Several American Protestant religious groups and women's groups, such as the Women's Christian Temperance Union, supported the movement. In 1919, Prohibitionists succeeded in amending the Constitution to prohibit the sale of alcohol. Although the Prohibition period did result in a 50% decrease in alcohol consumption, banning alcohol outright proved to be unworkable, as the previously legitimate distillery industry was replaced by criminal gangs that trafficked in alcohol. Prohibition was repealed in 1933. States and localities retained the right to remain ""dry"", and to this day, a handful still do.
During the Vietnam War era, attitudes swung well away from prohibition. Commentators noted that an 18-year-old could be drafted to war but could not buy a beer.
Since 1980, the trend has been toward greater restrictions on alcohol and drug use. The focus this time, however, has been to criminalize behaviors associated with alcohol, rather than attempt to prohibit consumption outright. New York was the first state to enact tough drunk-driving laws in 1980; since then all other states have followed suit. All states have also banned the purchase of alcoholic beverages by individuals under 21.
A ""Just Say No to Drugs"" movement replaced the more liberal ethos of the 1960s. This led to stricter drug laws and greater police latitude in drug cases. Drugs are, however, widely available, and 16% of Americans 12 and older used an illicit drug in 2012.
Since the 1990s, marijuana use has become increasingly tolerated in America, and a number of states allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes. In most states marijuana is still illegal without a medical prescription. Since the 2012 general election, voters in the District of Columbia and the states of Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington approved the legalization of marijuana for recreational use. Marijuana is illegal under federal law.

Death and funerals
It is customary for Americans to hold a wake in a funeral home within a couple of days of the death of a loved one. The body of the deceased may be embalmed and dressed in fine clothing if there will be an open-casket viewing. Traditional Jewish and Muslim practices include a ritual bath and no embalming. Friends, relatives and acquaintances gather, often from distant parts of the country, to ""pay their last respects"" to the deceased. Flowers are brought to the coffin and sometimes eulogies, elegies, personal anecdotes or group prayers are recited. Otherwise, the attendees sit, stand or kneel in quiet contemplation or prayer. Kissing the corpse on the forehead is typical among Italian Americans and others. Condolences are also offered to the widow or widower and other close relatives.
A funeral may be held immediately afterward or the next day. The funeral ceremony varies according to religion and culture. American Catholics typically hold a funeral mass in a church, which sometimes takes the form of a Requiem mass. Jewish Americans may hold a service in a synagogue or temple. Pallbearers carry the coffin of the deceased to the hearse, which then proceeds in a procession to the place of final repose, usually a cemetery. The unique Jazz funeral of New Orleans features joyous and raucous music and dancing during the procession.
Mount Auburn Cemetery (founded in 1831) is known as ""America's first garden cemetery."" American cemeteries created since are distinctive for their park-like setting. Rows of graves are covered by lawns and are interspersed with trees and flowers. Headstones, mausoleums, statuary or simple plaques typically mark off the individual graves. Cremation is another common practice in the United States, though it is frowned upon by various religions. The ashes of the deceased are usually placed in an urn, which may be kept in a private house, or they are interred. Sometimes the ashes are released into the atmosphere. The ""sprinkling"" or ""scattering"" of the ashes may be part of an informal ceremony, often taking place at a scenic natural feature (a cliff, lake or mountain) that was favored by the deceased.

Arts
Architecture
Architecture in the United States is regionally diverse and has been shaped by many external forces. U.S. architecture can therefore be said to be eclectic. Traditionally American architecture has influences from English architecture to Greco Roman architecture. The overriding theme of city American Architecture is modernity, as manifest in the skyscrapers of the 20th century, with domestic and residential architecture greatly varying according to local tastes and climate, rural American and suburban architecture tends to be more traditional.

Visual arts
In the late-18th and early-19th centuries, American artists primarily painted landscapes and portraits in a realistic style or that which looked to Europe for answers on technique: for example, John Singleton Copley was born in Boston, but most of his portraiture for which he is famous follow the trends of British painters like Thomas Gainsborough and the transitional period between Rococo and Neoclassicism. The later 18th century was a time when the United States was just an infant as a nation and as far away from the phenomenon where artists would receive training as craftsmen by apprenticeship and later seeking a fortune as a professional, ideally getting a patron: Many artists benefited from the patronage of Grand Tourists eager to procure mementos of their travels. There were no temples of Rome or grand nobility to be found in the Thirteen Colonies. Later developments of the 19th century brought America one of its earliest native homegrown movements, like the Hudson River School and portrait artists with a uniquely American flavor like Winslow Homer.

A parallel development taking shape in rural America was the American craft movement, which began as a reaction to the Industrial Revolution. As the nation grew wealthier, it had patrons able to buy the works of European painters and attract foreign talent willing to teach methods and techniques from Europe to willing students as well as artists themselves; photography became a very popular medium for both journalism and in time as a medium in its own right with America having plenty of open spaces of natural beauty and growing cities in the East teeming with new arrivals and new buildings. Museums in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. began to have a booming business in acquisitions, competing for works as diverse as the then more recent work of the Impressionists to pieces from ancient Egypt, all of which captured the public imaginations and further influenced fashion and architecture. Developments in modern art in Europe came to America from exhibitions in New York City such as the Armory Show in 1913. After World War II, New York emerged as a center of the art world. Painting in the United States today covers a vast range of styles. American painting includes works by Jackson Pollock, John Singer Sargent, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Norman Rockwell, among many others.

Literature
Theater and performing arts
Theater of the United States is based in the Western tradition. The United States originated stand-up comedy and modern improvisational theatre, which involves taking suggestions from the audience.

Minstrel show
The minstrel show, though now widely recognized as racist and offensive, is also recognized as the first uniquely American theatrical art form. Minstrel shows were developed in the 19th century and they were typically performed by white actors wearing blackface makeup for the purpose of imitating and caricaturing the speech and music of African Americans. Stephen Foster was a famous composer for minstrel shows. Many of his songs such as ""Camptown Races"", ""Oh Susanna"", and ""My Old Kentucky Home"" became popular American folk songs. Tap dancing and stand-up comedy have origins in minstrel shows.
Banjos, originally hand-made by slaves for entertainment on plantations, began to be mass-produced in the United States in the 1840s as a result of their extensive use on the minstrel stage.

Drama
American theater did not take on a unique dramatic identity until the emergence of Eugene O'Neill in the early 20th century, now considered by many to be the father of American drama. O'Neill is a four-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize for drama and the only American playwright to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. After O'Neill, American drama came of age and flourished with the likes of Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, Lillian Hellman, William Inge, and Clifford Odets during the first half of the 20th century. After this fertile period, American theater broke new ground, artistically, with the absurdist forms of Edward Albee in the 1960s.

Social commentary has also been a preoccupation of American theater, often addressing issues not discussed in the mainstream. Writers such as Lorraine Hansbury, August Wilson, David Mamet and Tony Kushner have all won Pulitzer Prizes for their polemical plays on American society.

Musical theater
The United States is also the home and largest exporter of modern musical theater, producing such musical talents as Rodgers and Hammerstein, Lerner and Loewe, Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, Leonard Bernstein, George and Ira Gershwin, Kander and Ebb, and Stephen Sondheim. Broadway is one of the largest theater communities in the world and is the epicenter of American commercial theater.

Music
American music styles and influences (such as country, jazz, blues, rock, pop, techno, soul, and hip hop) and music based on them can be heard all over the world. Music in the U.S. is very diverse, and the country has the world's largest music market with a total retail value of $4.9 billion in 2014.
The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have significantly influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European and African traditions. The Smithsonian Institution states, ""African-American influences are so fundamental to American music that there would be no American music without them."" Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Known for singing in a wide variety of genres, Aretha Franklin is considered one of the all-time greatest American singers.
Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, and Little Richard were among the pioneers of rock and roll in the mid-1950s. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales. In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America's most celebrated songwriters. 
American popular music, as part of the wider U.S. pop culture, has a worldwide influence and following. Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Elvis Presley became global celebrities, as have artists of the late 20th century such as Michael Jackson, Prince, Madonna, and Whitney Houston. American professional opera singers have reached the highest level of success in that form, including Renée Fleming, Leontyne Price, Beverly Sills, Nelson Eddy, and many others.
As of 2022, Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus, Ariana Grande, Eminem, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, and many others contemporary artists dominate global streaming rankings.
The annual Coachella music festival in California is one of the largest, most famous, and most profitable music festivals in the United States and the world.

Cinema
The United States movie industry has a worldwide influence and following. Hollywood, a northern district of Los Angeles, California, is the leader in motion picture production and the most recognizable movie industry in the world. The major film studios of the United States are the primary source of the most commercially successful and most ticket selling movies in the world.
The dominant style of American cinema is classical Hollywood cinema, which developed from 1913 to 1969 and is still typical of most films made there to this day. While Frenchmen Auguste and Louis Lumière are generally credited with the birth of modern cinema, American cinema soon came to be a dominant force in the emerging industry. The world's first sync-sound musical film, The Jazz Singer, was released in 1927, and was at the forefront of sound-film development in the following decades. Orson Welles's Citizen Kane (1941) is frequently cited in critics' polls as the greatest film of all time.

Broadcasting
Television constitutes a significant part of the traditional media of the United States. Household ownership of television sets in the country is 96.7%, and the majority of households have more than one set. The peak ownership percentage of households with at least one television set occurred during the 1996–97 season, with 98.4% ownership. As a whole, the television networks of the United States is the largest and most syndicated in the world.
As of August 2013, approximately 114,200,000 American households own at least one television set.
In 2014, due to a recent surge in the number and popularity of critically acclaimed television series, many critics have said that American television is currently enjoying a golden age.

Philosophy
Early American philosophy was heavily shaped by the European Age of Enlightenment, which promoted ideals such as reason and individual liberty. Enlightenment ideals influenced the American Revolution and the Constitution of the United States. Major figures in the American Enlightenment included Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, George Mason and Thomas Paine.
Pragmatism and transcendentalism are uniquely American philosophical traditions founded in the 19th century by William James and Ralph Waldo Emerson respectively. Objectivism is a philosophical system founded by Ayn Rand which influenced libertarianism. John Rawls presented the theory of ""justice as fairness"" in A Theory of Justice (1971).
Willard Van Orman Quine, Saul Kripke, and David Lewis helped advance logic and analytic philosophy in the 20th century. Thomas Kuhn revolutionized the philosophy of science with his book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962), one of the most cited academic works of all time, and he coined the term paradigm shift.
Artificial intelligence and the philosophy of mind have been heavily influenced by American philosophers such as Daniel Dennett, Noam Chomsky, Hilary Putnam, Jerry Fodor, and John Searle, who contributed to cognitivism, the hard problem of consciousness, and the mind-body problem. The Libet experiment created by American neuroscientist Benjamin Libet raised philosophical debate regarding the neuroscience of free will. The Chinese room thought experiment presented by John Searle questions the nature of intelligence in machines, and it has been influential in cognitive science and the philosophy of artificial intelligence.

Society
Education
Education in the United States is and has historically been provided mainly by the government. Control and funding come from three levels: federal, state, and local. School attendance is mandatory and nearly universal at the elementary and high school levels (often known outside the United States as the primary and secondary levels).
Students have the option of having their education held in public schools, private schools, or home school. In most public and private schools, education is divided into three levels: elementary school, junior high school (also often called middle school), and high school. In almost all schools at these levels, children are divided by age groups into grades. Post-secondary education, better known as ""college"" in the United States, is generally governed separately from the elementary and high school systems.
In the year 2000, there were 76.6 million students enrolled in schools from kindergarten through graduate schools. Of these, 72 percent aged 12 to 17 were judged academically ""on track"" for their age (enrolled in school at or above grade level). Of those enrolled in compulsory education, 5.2 million (10.4 percent) were attending private schools. Among the country's adult population, over 85 percent have completed high school and 27 percent have received a bachelor's degree or higher.

The large majority of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top 25, and the most prestigious – Harvard University. The country also has by far the most Nobel Prize winners in history, with 403 (having won 406 awards).

Religion
Among developed countries, the U.S. is one of the most religious in terms of its demographics. According to a 2002 study by the Pew Global Attitudes Project, the U.S. was the only developed nation in the survey where a majority of citizens reported that religion played a ""very important"" role in their lives, an opinion similar to that found in Latin America. Today, governments at the national, state, and local levels are secular institutions, with what is often called the ""separation of church and state"". The most popular religion in the U.S. is Christianity, comprising the majority of the population (73.7% of adults in 2016).
Although participation in organized religion has been diminishing, the public life and popular culture of the United States incorporates many Christian ideals specifically about redemption, salvation, conscience, and morality. Examples are popular culture obsessions with confession and forgiveness, which extends from reality television to twelve-step meetings.

Most of the British Thirteen Colonies were generally not tolerant of dissident forms of worship. Civil and religious restrictions were most strictly applied by the Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony which saw various banishments applied to enforce conformity, including the branding iron, the whipping post, the bilboes and the hangman's noose. The persecuting spirit was shared by Plymouth Colony and the colonies along the Connecticut river. Mary Dyer was one of the four executed Quakers known as the Boston martyrs, and her death on the Boston gallows marked the beginning of the end of Puritan theocracy and New England independence from English rule; in 1661 Massachusetts was forbidden from executing anyone for professing Quakerism. Anti-Catholic sentiment appeared in New England with the first Pilgrim and Puritan settlers. The Pilgrims of New England held radical Protestant disapproval of Christmas. Christmas observance was outlawed in Boston in 1659. The ban by the Puritans was revoked in 1681 by an English appointed governor; however, it was not until the mid-19th century that celebrating Christmas became common in the Boston region.
The colony of Maryland, founded by the Catholic Lord Baltimore in 1634, came closest to applying freedom of religion. Fifteen years later (1649), the Maryland Toleration Act, drafted by Lord Baltimore, provided: ""No person or persons...shall from henceforth be any waies troubled, molested or discountenanced for or in respect of his or her religion nor in the free exercise thereof."" The Act allowed freedom of worship for all Trinitarian Christians in Maryland, but sentenced to death anyone who denied the divinity of Jesus.
Modeling the provisions concerning religion within the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, the framers of the United States Constitution rejected any religious test for office, and the First Amendment specifically denied the central government any power to enact any law respecting either an establishment of religion or prohibiting its free exercise. In the following decades, the animating spirit behind the constitution's Establishment Clause led to the disestablishment of the official religions within the member states. The framers were mainly influenced by secular, Enlightenment ideals, but they also considered the pragmatic concerns of minority religious groups who did not want to be under the power or influence of a state religion that did not represent them. Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence said: ""The priest has been hostile to liberty. He is always in alliance with the despot.""
Gallup polls during the early 2020s found that about 81% of Americans believe in some conception of a God and 45% report praying on a daily basis. According to their poll in December 2022, ""31% report attending a church, synagogue, mosque or temple weekly or nearly weekly today."" In the ""Bible Belt"", which is located primarily within the Southern United States, socially conservative evangelical Protestantism plays a significant role culturally. New England and the Western United States tend to be less religious. Around 6% of Americans claim a non-Christian faith; the largest of which are Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism. The United States either has the first or second-largest Jewish population in the world, and the largest outside of Israel. ""Ceremonial deism"" is common in American culture.
Around 30% of Americans describe themselves as having no religion. Membership in a house of worship fell from 70% in 1999 to 47% in 2020, much of the decline related to the number of Americans expressing no religious preference. Membership also fell among those who identified with a specific religious group. According to Gallup, trust in ""the church or organized religion"" has declined significantly since the 1970s. According to the 2022 Cooperative Election Study, younger Americans are significantly less religious. Among Generation Z, a near-majority consider themselves atheist, agnostic, or nothing in particular.

Social class and work
Though the majority of Americans in the 21st century identify themselves as middle class, American society has experienced increased income inequality. Social class, generally described as a combination of educational attainment, income and occupational prestige, is one of the greatest cultural influences in America. Nearly all cultural aspects of mundane interactions and consumer behavior in the U.S. are guided by a person's location within the country's social structure.
Distinct lifestyles, consumption patterns and values are associated with different classes. Early sociologist-economist Thorstein Veblen, for example, said that those at the top of the societal hierarchy engage in conspicuous leisure and conspicuous consumption. Upper class Americans commonly have elite Ivy League educations and are traditionally members of exclusive clubs and fraternities with connections to high society, distinguished by their enormous incomes derived from their wealth in assets. The upper-class lifestyle and values often overlap with that of the upper middle class, but with more emphasis on security and privacy in home life and for philanthropy (i.e. the ""Donor Class"") and the arts. Due to their large wealth (inherited or accrued over a lifetime of investments) and lavish, leisurely lifestyles, the upper class are more prone to idleness. The upper middle class, or the ""working rich"", commonly identify education and being cultured as prime values, similar to the upper class. Persons in this particular social class tend to speak in a more direct manner that projects authority, knowledge and thus credibility. They often tend to engage in the consumption of so-called mass luxuries, such as designer label clothing. A strong preference for natural materials, organic foods, and a strong health consciousness tend to be prominent features of the upper middle class. American middle-class individuals in general value expanding one's horizon, partially because they are more educated and can afford greater leisure and travel. Working-class individuals take great pride in doing what they consider to be ""real work"" and keep very close-knit kin networks that serve as a safeguard against frequent economic instability.
Working-class Americans and many of those in the middle class may also face occupation alienation. In contrast to upper-middle-class professionals who are mostly hired to conceptualize, supervise, and share their thoughts, many Americans have little autonomy or creative latitude in the workplace. As a result, white collar professionals tend to be significantly more satisfied with their work. In 2006, Elizabeth Warren presented her article entitled ""The Middle Class on the Precipice"", stating that individuals in the center of the income strata, who may still identify as middle class, have faced increasing economic insecurity, supporting the idea of a working-class majority. Additionally, working-class Americans who work in the public sector, excluding politicians, are respected and generally respected in the culture, notably postal workers.

Political behavior is affected by class; more affluent individuals are more likely to vote, and education and income affect whether individuals tend to vote for the Democratic or Republican party. Income also had a significant impact on health as those with higher incomes had better access to health care facilities, higher life expectancy, lower infant mortality rate and increased health consciousness. This is particularly noticeable with black voters who are often socially conservative, yet overwhelmingly vote Democratic.
In the United States, occupation is one of the prime factors of social class and is closely linked to an individual's identity. The average workweek in the U.S. for those employed full-time was 42.9 hours long with 30% of the population working more than 40 hours a week. The Average American worker earned $16.64 an hour in the first two quarters of 2006. Overall Americans worked more than their counterparts in other developed post-industrial nations. While the average worker in Denmark enjoyed 30 days of vacation annually, the average American had 16 annual vacation days.
In 2000, the average American worked 1,978 hours per year, 500 hours more than the average German, yet 100 hours less than the average Czech. Overall, the U.S. labor force is one of the most productive in the world, largely due to its workers working more than those in any other post-industrial country, except for South Korea. Americans generally hold working and being productive in high regard. Individualism, having a strong work ethic, competitiveness, and altruism are among the most cited American values. According to a 2016 study by the Charities Aid Foundation, Americans donated 1.44% of total GDP to charity, the highest in the world by a large margin.

Race, ancestry, and immigration
The United States has an ethnically diverse population, and 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members. White Americans with ancestry from Europe, the Middle East or North Africa, form the largest racial and ethnic group at 57.8% of the U.S. population. Hispanic and Latino Americans form the second-largest group and are 18.7% of the U.S. population. African Americans constitute the nation's third-largest ancestry group and are 12.1% of the total U.S. population. Asian Americans are the country's fourth-largest group, composing 5.9% of the U.S. population, while the country's 3.7 million Native Americans account for about 1%. In 2020, the median age of the U.S. population was 38.5 years.
According to the United Nations, the U.S. has the highest number of immigrant population in the world, with 50,661,149 people. In 2018, there were almost 90 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants in the U.S., accounting for 28% of the overall U.S. population. In 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7 million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3 million) were lawful permanent residents, 6% (2.2 million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5 million) were unauthorized immigrants. The U.S. led the world in refugee resettlement for decades, admitting more refugees than the rest of the world combined.
Race in the U.S. is based on physical characteristics, such as skin color, and has played an essential part in shaping American society even before the nation's conception. Until the civil rights movement of the 1960s, racial minorities in the U.S. faced institutional discrimination and both social and economic marginalization. The U.S. Census Bureau currently recognizes five racial groupings: White, African, Native, Asian, and Pacific Islander. According to the U.S. government, Hispanic Americans do not constitute a race, but rather an ethnic group. During the 2000 U.S. census, Whites made up 75.1% of the population; those who are Hispanic or Latino constituted the nation's prevalent minority with 12.5% of the population. African Americans made up 12.3% of the total population, 3.6% were Asian American, and 0.7% were Native American.

With its ratification on December 6, 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution abolished slavery in the U.S. The Northern states had outlawed slavery in their territory in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, though their industrial economies relied on raw materials produced by slaves in the South. Following the Reconstruction period in the 1870s, racist legislation emerged in the Southern states named the Jim Crow laws that provided for legal segregation. Lynching was practiced throughout the U.S., including in the Northern states, until the 1930s, while continuing well into the civil rights movement in the South.
Chinese Americans were earlier marginalized as well during a significant proportion of U.S. history. Between 1882 and 1943, the U.S. instituted the Chinese Exclusion Act barring all Chinese immigrants from entering the U.S. During the Second World War against the Empire of Japan, roughly 120,000 Japanese Americans, 62% of whom were U.S. citizens, were imprisoned in Japanese internment camps by the U.S. government following the attack on Pearl Harbor, an American military base, by Japanese forces in December 1941.
Due to exclusion from or marginalization by earlier mainstream society, there emerged a unique subculture among the racial minorities in the U.S. During the 1920s, Harlem, New York City became home to the Harlem Renaissance. Music styles such as jazz, blues, rap, rock and roll, and numerous folk songs such as Blue Tail Fly (Jimmy Crack Corn) originated within the realms of African American culture and were later adopted by the mainstream. Chinatowns can be found in many cities across the country and Asian cuisine has become a common staple in mainstream America. The Hispanic community has also had a dramatic impact on American culture. Today, Catholics are the largest religious denomination in the U.S. and outnumber Protestants in the Southwest and California. Mariachi music and Mexican cuisine are commonly found throughout the Southwest, and some Latin dishes, such as burritos and tacos, are found practically everywhere in the nation.
Asian Americans have median household income and educational attainment exceeding that of other races. African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans have considerably lower income and education than do White Americans or Asian Americans.

Race relations
White Americans (non-Hispanic/Latino and Hispanic/Latino) are the racial majority and have a 72% share of the U.S. population, according to the 2010 U.S. census. Hispanic and Latino Americans comprise 15% of the population, making up the largest ethnic minority. Black Americans are the largest racial minority, comprising nearly 13% of the population. The White, non-Hispanic or Latino population comprises 63% of the nation's total.
Throughout most of the country's history before and after its independence, the majority race in the United States has been Caucasian—aided by historic restrictions on citizenship and immigration—and the largest racial minority has been African Americans, most of whom are descended from slaves smuggled to the Americas by the European colonial powers. This relationship has historically been the most important one since the founding of the United States. Slavery existed in the United States at the time of the country's formation in the 1770s. The Missouri Compromise declared a policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana lands north of the 36°30′ parallel. De facto, it sectionalized the country into two factions: free states, which forbid the institution of slavery; and slave states, which protected the institution. The Missouri Compromise was controversial, seen as lawfully dividing the country along sectarian lines. Although the federal government outlawed American participation in the Atlantic slave trade in 1807, after 1820, cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South, and along with it, the use of slave labor. The Second Great Awakening, especially in the period 1800–1840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism; in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations.
Slavery was partially abolished by the Emancipation Proclamation issued by the president Abraham Lincoln in 1862 for slaves in the Southeastern United States during the Civil War. With the United States' victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally by the Thirteenth Amendment. Jim Crow laws prevented full use of African American citizenship until the civil rights movement in the 1960s, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed official or legal segregation at any level and forbid placing limitations on minorities' access to public places.

In 1882, in response to Chinese immigration due to the Gold Rush and the labor needed for the transcontinental railroad, the government signed into law the Chinese Exclusion Act which banned immigration by Chinese people into the U.S. In the late 19th century, the growth of the Hispanic population in the U.S., fueled largely by Mexican immigration, generated debate over policies such as English as the official language and reform to immigration policies. The Immigration Act of 1924 established the National Origins Formula as the basis of U.S. immigration policy, largely to restrict immigration from Asia, Southern Europe, and Eastern Europe. According to the Office of the Historian of the U.S. Department of State, the purpose of the 1924 Act was ""to preserve the ideal of U.S. homogeneity"". In 1924, Indian-born Bhagat Singh Thind was twice denied citizenship as he was not deemed white. Marking a radical break from U.S. immigration policies of the past, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 opened entry to the U.S. to non-Germanic groups. This Act significantly altered the demographic mix in the U.S. as a result, creating a modern, diverse America.
A huge majority of Americans of all races disapprove of racism. Nevertheless, some Americans continue to hold negative racial/ethnic stereotypes about various racial and ethnic groups. Professor Imani Perry, of Princeton University, has argued that contemporary racism in the United States ""is frequently unintentional or unacknowledged on the part of the actor"", believing that racism mostly stems unconsciously from below the level of cognition.

Transport
Automobiles and commuting
Personal transportation is dominated by automobiles, which operate on a network of 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) of public roads, making it the longest network in the world. In 2001, 90% of Americans drove to work by car. As of 2022, the United States is the second-largest manufacturer of motor vehicles and is home to Tesla, the world's most valuable car company. General Motors held the title of the world's best-selling automaker from 1931 to 2008. Currently, the U.S. has the world's second-largest automobile market by sales and the highest vehicle ownership per capita in the world, with 816.4 vehicles per 1,000 Americans (2014). In 2017, there were 255 million non-two wheel motor vehicles, or about 910 vehicles per 1,000 people.
Beginning in the 1990s, lower energy and land costs favor the production of relatively larger cars, leading to a decline in economy cars. The culture in the 1950s and 1960s often catered to the automobile with motels and drive-in restaurants. Outside of the relatively few urban areas, it is considered a necessity for most Americans to own and drive cars. New York City is the only locality in the United States where more than half of all households do not own a car. In a car-dependent America, there is a common dislike of car dealerships and car salesmen, with only 10 percent of U.S. citizens in a Gallup poll rating them highly honest. Matilda by Roald Dahl gives an example of this stereotype: Matilda's father sells used cars by filling their engines with sawdust or reversing their odometers with a drill.

The United States emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry in the early 20th century. General Motors Corporation (GM), the company that would soon become the world's largest automaker, was founded in 1908 by William Durant. The U.S. also became the first country in the world to have a mass market for vehicle production and sales, and mass market production process. In the 1950s and 1960s, subcultures began to arise around the modification and racing of American automobiles and converting them into hot rods. Later, in the late-1960s and early-1970s Detroit manufacturers began making muscle cars and pony cars to cater to wealthier Americans seeking hot rod style & performance. This culture has evolved into a worldwide phenomenon for car enthusiasts of today, and the project car is a common sight in American suburbs.

Cultural institutions
Governmental culture institutions
The United States government does not have a ministry of culture, but there are a number of government institutions with cultural responsibilities, including the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities, the Federal Communications Commission, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution, and the National Gallery of Art.
Many state and city governments have a department dedicated to cultural affairs.

National Register of Historic Places
The National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) is the United States federal government's official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their historical significance or ""great artistic value."" For most of its history, the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service (NPS), an agency within the U.S. Department of the Interior.

Non-governmental culture institutions
Major private US-based culture institutions include the Poetry Foundation, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, the J. Paul Getty Trust, and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

Museums
In the United States, there are many museums, both public and private. Major museums in the US include the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the museums of the Smithsonian Institution, the American Museum of Natural History, the Art Institute of Chicago, and The Getty Museum.

Archives
There are various archives in the United States for the preservation of history and culture, such as the National Archives and Records Administration.

History
19th century
The rise of urban tourism in the United States during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries represented a major cultural transformation concerning urban space and leisure natural activity and as an industry. Package tours did not exist until the 1870s and 1880s, when entrepreneurs of various sorts from hotel keepers and agents for railroad lines to artists and writers recognized the profit to be gained from the prospering tourism industry. The rise of locomotive steam-powered trains during the 1800s enabled tourists to travel more easily and quickly.
In the United States, 2,800 miles (4,500 km) of rail track had been completed by 1840, by 1860 all major eastern US cities were linked by rail, and by 1869 the first trans-American railroad link was completed. Yosemite Park was developed as a tourist attraction in the late 1850s and early 1860s for an audience who wanted a national icon and place to symbolize exotic wonder of its region. Photography played an important role for the first time in the development of tourist attractions, making it possible to distribute hundreds of images showing various places of interest.
New York City, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco were all attracting numerous tourists by the 1890s. New York's population grew from 300,000 in 1840 to 800,000 in 1850. Chicago experienced a dramatic increase from 4,000 residents in 1840 to 300,000 by 1870.
The word “tourist” originally referred to those going to Europe or viewing natural wonders in New York and New England. In the 19th century dictionaries began to publish the word.
There was not much urban tourism during the 19th century, perhaps because American cities lacked the architecture and art which attracted thousands to Europe. American cities tended to offend the sensitive with ugliness and commercialism rather than inspire awe or aesthetic pleasure. Some tourists were fascinated by the rapid growth of the new urban areas: ""It is an absorbing thing to watch the process of world-making; both the formation of the natural and the conventional world,"" wrote English writer Harriet Martineau in 1837.

As American cities developed, new institutions to accommodate and care for the insane, disabled and criminal were constructed. The Hartford, Connecticut American School for the Deaf opened in 1817, Ossining, New York state prison (now known as Sing Sing) in 1825, the Connecticut State Penitentiary at Wethersfield in 1827, Mount Auburn Cemetery in 1831, the Perkins School for the Blind in 1832, and the Worcester State Hospital in 1833.  These institutions attracted the curiosity of American and foreign visitors. The English writer and actress Fanny Kemble, an admirer of the American prison system, was also concerned that nature was being destroyed in favor of new developments. Guidebooks published in the 1830s, 40s and 50s described new prisons, asylums and institutions for the deaf and blind, and urged tourists to visit these sights.
Accounts of these visits written by Charles Dickens, Harriet Martineau, Lydia Sigourney and Caroline Gilman were published in magazines and travel books. Sigourney's Scenes in My Native Land (1845) included descriptions of her tour of Niagara Falls and other places of scenic interest with accounts of her visits to prisons and asylums. Many visited these institutions because nothing like them had existed before. The buildings which housed them were themselves monumental, often placed on hilltops as a symbol of accomplishment.

Early tourism
By 1915, city touring had marked significant shifts in the way Americans perceived, organized and moved around in urban environments. Urban tourism became a profitable industry in 1915 as the number of tour agencies, railroad passenger departments, guidebook publishers and travel writers grew at a fast pace. The expense of pleasure tours between 1850 and 1915 meant that only a minority of Americans could experience the luxury of tourism. Many Americans traveled to find work, but few found time for enjoyment of the urban environment. As transportation networks improved, the length of commuting decreased, and income rose. A growing number of Americans were able to afford short vacations by 1915. Still, mass tourism was not possible until after World War II.
During the 19th century, tourism of any form had been available only to the upper and middle classes. This changed during the early 20th century. In 1895, popular publications printed articles showing the car was cheaper to operate than the horse. The development of automobiles in the early 1900s included the introduction of the Ford Model T in 1908. In 1900, 8,000 cars were registered in the US, but this had increased to 619,000 by 1911. By the time of the Model T's introduction in 1908, there were 44 US households per car. Early cars were a luxury for the wealthy, but after Ford began to dramatically drop prices after 1913, more were able to afford one.
The development of hotels with leisure complexes had become popular in the U.S. during the 1930s. The range of club type holidays available appealed to a broad segment of the holiday market. As more families traveled independently by car, hotels failed to cater to their needs. Kemmons Wilson opened the first motel as a new form of accommodation in Memphis, Tennessee in 1952.
Although thousands of tourists visited Florida during the early 1900s, it was not until after World War II that the tourist industry quickly became Florida's largest source of income. Florida's white sandy beaches, warm winter temperatures and wide range of activities such as swimming, fishing, boating and hiking all attracted tourists to the state. During the 1930s, architects designed Art Deco style buildings in Miami Beach. Visitors are still attracted to the Art Deco district of Miami. Theme parks were soon built across Florida. One of the largest resorts in the world, Walt Disney World Resort, was opened near Orlando, Florida in 1971. In its first year, the 28,000-acre (110 km2) park added $14 billion to Orlando's economy.

Late 20th century
The revolution of air travel between 1945 and 1969 contributed greatly to tourism in the United States. In that quarter century, commercial aviation evolved from 28-passenger airliners flying at less than 200 mph (320 km/h) to 150-passenger jetliners cruising continents at 600 mph (970 km/h). During this time, air travel in the U.S. evolved from a novelty into a routine for business travelers and vacationers alike. Rapid developments in aviation technology, economic prosperity in the United States and the demand for air travel all contributed to the early beginnings of commercial aviation in the US.
During the first four decades of the 20th century, long-haul journeys between large American cities were accomplished using trains. By the 1950s, air travel was part of everyday life for many Americans. This was also helped by the establishment of the Interstate Highway System as well as the reliance of automobiles of which Americans saw cars as their new personal found freedom and enjoyment. The tourism industry in the U.S. experienced exponential growth as tourists could travel almost anywhere with a fast, reliable and routine system. For some, a vacation in Hawaii was now a more frequent pleasure. Air travel changed everything from family vacations to Major League Baseball, as had steam-powered trains in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
By the end of the twentieth century, tourism had significantly grown throughout the world. The World Tourism Organisation (WTO, 1998) recorded that, in 1950, arrivals of tourists from abroad, excluding same-day visits, numbered about 25.2 million. By 1997, the figure was 612.8 million. In 1950 receipts from international movements were US$ 2.1 billion, in 1997 they were $443.7 billion.
It was also during the late 20th century that individual states began to adopt their own tourism slogans, with the aim to increase both domestic and international visitors. Some of these slogans have become iconic to the state itself, such as Michigan's ""Pure Michigan"" campaign, New York's ""I Love New York"" merchandise, and Virginia's ""Virginia is for Lovers"" slogan. Other states adopted slogans based on civilian submissions, such as Pennsylvania holding the ""Penn a Phrase"" contest, in which the slogan ""Pursue Your Happiness"" was ultimately selected. Some slogans became the targets of campaigns to rename them launched by state residents, such as a failed 2013 campaign to change Kentucky's slogan from ""Unbridled Spirit"" to ""Kentucky Kicks Ass"".

21st century
The travel and tourism industry in the U.S. was among the first commercial casualties of the September 11 attacks, a series of terrorist attacks on the U.S. Terrorists used four commercial airliners as weapons of destruction, all of which were destroyed in the attacks on New York City, Washington, D.C., and in Pennsylvania with nearly 3,000 deaths. In the first full week after flights resumed, passenger numbers fell by nearly 45 percent, from 9 million in the week before September 11 to 5 million. Hotels and travel agencies received cancellations across the world. The hotel industry suffered an estimated $700 million loss in revenue during the four days following the attacks. The situation recovered over the following months as the Federal Reserve kept the financial system afloat. The U.S. Congress issued a $5 billion grant to the nation's airlines and $10 billion in loan guarantees to keep them flying.
In the U.S., tourism is either the first, second, or third largest employer in 29 states, employing 7.3 million in 2004, to take care of 1.19 billion trips tourists took in the U.S. in 2005. The U.S. outbound holiday market is sensitive in the short term, but possibly one of the most surprising results from the September 11, 2001 attacks was that by February 2002 it had bounced back. This quick revival was generally quicker than many commentators had predicted only five months earlier.
The United States economy began to slow significantly in 2007, mostly because of a real-estate slump, gas prices and related financial problems. Many economists believe that the economy entered a recession at the end of 2007 or early in 2008. Some state budgets for tourism marketing have decreased, such as Connecticut which is facing soaring gas prices.
100 million tourists visited Florida in 2015, a record for the nation.

Attractions
There exist a broad range of tourist attractions in the United States such as amusement parks, festivals, gambling, golf courses, historical buildings and landmarks, hotels, museums, galleries, outdoor recreation, spas, restaurants and sports.

Travel warnings
In August 2019, after various mass shootings in the U.S., Amnesty International and some countries issued a travel warning.

Visitor statistics
The highest numbers of non-immigrant admissions into the United States for tourists and for business purposes in were from the following countries:

Landmarks
As of 2007, there are 2,462 registered National Historic Landmarks (NHL) recognized by the United States government.  Each major US city has thousands of landmarks. For example, New York City has 23,000 landmarks designated by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. These landmarks include various individual buildings, interiors, historic districts, and scenic sites which help define the culture and character of New York City.

Natural monuments
There are many natural monuments in the United States and they are a large tourist venue.

Sports
Sporting events and their associated venues make up a significant percentage of tourist dollars in the US. Estimates of the US sports industry's size vary from $213 billion to $410 billion. In 1997, 25% of tourism receipts in the United States were related to sports tourism; this would have valued the market at approximately $350 billion annually. Many US sporting events routinely attract international visitors. The 1997 New York City Marathon attracted 12,000 participants from outside the US, out of 28,000 participants.

Hotels
Hotels can be both housing for tourists visiting a particular region or city, and destinations themselves, with many hotels having historic and cultural status.

The federal government does not require private businesses to close or offer paid time off, as is the case for most state and local governments, so employers determine which holidays to observe.
Several federal holidays are widely observed by private businesses with paid time off. These include New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Businesses often close or grant paid time off for New Year's Eve, Christmas Eve, and the Day after Thanksgiving, but none of these are federal holidays. Other federal holidays are less widely observed by businesses. Most federal holidays are celebrated on a Monday or Friday to create a three-day weekend.

Overview
There are no national holidays on which the law requires all businesses to close. Federal holidays are only established for certain federally chartered and regulated businesses, government contractors, and the city of Washington, DC. All other public holidays are created by the States. Most states allow local jurisdictions, cities, villages, etc., to establish local holidays. As a result, holidays have not historically been governed at the federal level, and federal law does not govern business openings.
Many states have additional holidays that the federal government does not observe. Most prominent among these are holidays to celebrate statehood. Since 2000, some city and state-level celebrations of Malcolm X Day and Rosa Parks Day have been created, in addition to the federal Martin Luther King Jr. Day, to honor and recognize African American contributions to the United States. Missouri honors Rosa Parks on her birthday. 
Colorado became the first state to establish a paid state holiday honoring a woman in 2020 with the designation of the first Monday in October as Frances Xavier Cabrini Day.

Many businesses observe certain holidays, which are also not mandated by any government agency. Many workplaces celebrate religious observance as well as ethnic holidays, such as Saint Patrick's Day, Kwanzaa, Diwali, Mardi Gras, and Cinco de Mayo, as a matter of best practice.
While the popularity of each public holiday cannot easily be measured, the holiday with the highest greeting card sales is Christmas. Major retail establishments, such as shopping malls and centers, close only on Thanksgiving and Christmas, but remain open on all other holidays, with early closings on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, and sometimes on other major holidays. In the face of a rapidly tightening retail market in the 2010s, retailers have increasingly been opening on Thanksgiving evening and night to extend Black Friday and the holiday shopping season, however, the COVID-19 pandemic greatly limited this practice. 
Virtually all large companies observe and close on the major holidays (New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas). Some non-retail businesses close the day after Thanksgiving, while others, such as federal banks and post offices, are not allowed to close that day. Some smaller businesses normally open on Sundays will close on Easter Sunday if they expect to have very few customers that day.

Holiday business restrictions
Some states restrict certain business activities on some holidays. Business closures are mandated on a few holidays in some states for certain kinds of businesses by blue laws. For example, businesses that operate on more than 5,000 square feet (460 m2) cannot open on Thanksgiving in some New England states. The most notable businesses to close on such occasions are car dealerships and liquor stores. Some holidays are observed with community service, depending on the meaning of the holiday. Service is not mandated by any government agencies, whether they be federal, state, or local.

Federal holidays
The following federal holidays are observed by the majority of private businesses with paid time off:

New Year's Day (January 1)
Memorial Day (May 25–31, floating Monday)
Independence Day (July 4)
Labor Day (September 1–7, floating Monday)
Thanksgiving Day (November 22–28, floating Thursday)
Christmas Day (December 25)
Other federal holidays are less widely observed by businesses. These include:

Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. (January 15–21, floating Monday)
Washington's Birthday (February 15–21, floating Monday)
Juneteenth National Independence Day (June 19)
Columbus Day (October 8–14, floating Monday)
Veterans Day (November 11)
Established in 2021, Juneteenth is the newest federal holiday. In its second year of federal observance, 30% of private employers offered paid time off.

Holidays with religious significance
Religious and cultural holidays in the United States are characterized by a diversity of religious beliefs and practices. However, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ...."" and Article VI specifies that ""no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States."" As a result, various religious faiths have flourished, as well as perished, in the United States. In 2002, a majority of Americans reported that religion plays a ""very important"" role in their lives, a proportion unique among developed nations.
In 2012, the majority of Americans (73–80%) identified themselves as Christians and about 15–20% had no religious affiliation. In the 2008 American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS), 76% of American adults population identified themselves as Christians, with 51% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant or unaffiliated, and 25% professing Catholic beliefs. The same survey said that other religions (including, for example, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, and Hinduism) collectively made up about 4% of the adult population, another 15% of the adult population claimed no religious affiliation, and 5.2% said they did not know, or they refused to reply. In a 2012 survey by the Pew forum, 36 percent of Americans stated that they attended services nearly every week or more.

Christian holidays
With 65% of adults in the U.S. identifying as Christian in 2019, many holidays from the liturgical calendar are observed by this segment of the population. Many businesses, as well as federal, state, and local governments, are closed on Christmas. A reference in the film A Christmas Story shows a Chinese restaurant being the only establishment open on Christmas.
Some private businesses and certain other institutions are closed on Good Friday (March 29 2024, April 18 2025, April 3 2026, March 26 2027). The financial market and stock market is closed on Good Friday. Most retail stores remain open, although some might close early. Public schools and most universities are closed on Good Friday, either as a holiday of its own, or part of spring break. The postal service operates, and banks regulated by the federal government do not close for Good Friday.
Many companies, including banks, malls, shopping centers, and most private retail stores that normally open on Sundays are closed on Easter (March 31 2024, April 20 2025, April 5 2026, March 28 2027).

Hindu holidays
The Hindu holidays of Diwali and Holi are celebrated in some parts of the United States, mostly by Indian Americans or peoples of Indian descent. Holi, the ""festival of colors"" has inspired a Broadway musical based on this festival. While not officially recognized in most of the United States, the New York City Council officially recognized these as official school holidays in New York City. CNN reported that the Diwali holiday is shown in American pop culture through an episode of The Office.

Jewish holidays
The three most commonly celebrated Jewish holidays are Passover (Sunset, April 12, 2025 – nightfall, April 20, 2025), Rosh Hashanah (Sunset, September 22, 2025 – nightfall, September 24, 2025), and Yom Kippur (Sunset, October 1, 2025 – nightfall, October 2, 2025). Passover, Yom Kippur, Rosh Hashanah, and Hanukkah (Sunset, December 14, 2025 – nightfall, December 22, 2025) are recognized as an optional state level holiday in Texas. All Jewish holidays start the night before, as that is when the Jewish day begins.

Islamic holidays
The major Islamic holidays of Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha have been recognized in the United States. Awareness of these holidays can be found in calendars published by major calendar manufacturers. According to Al-Jazeera, schools in New York and Michigan (mainly Dearborn) may begin to close in observance of all Muslim holidays.

Holidays with other cultural or historical significance
Drinking holidays
According to the National Institutes of Health, about 86% of the population over 18 drinks alcohol recreationally or socially. In the United States, the holidays that are considered the most ""festive"" are generally regarded as some of the ""most drunken holidays"". Celebrations usually revolve around barbecues and beer. Although many of these holidays lack any official status, they are generally observed by the drinking culture for the fact that these holidays revolve around drinking. 
One measurement of the popularity of these holidays is the amount of alcohol purchased for the occasion. One survey names New Year's Eve as the holiday on which the most alcohol is consumed based on sales. While many holidays are listed, some are generally notable for their drinking requirement while others are known for abstinence.

African American holidays
Some holidays in the United States celebrate or recognize the struggle of African-Americans for emancipation from slavery and civil rights. Two holidays are celebrated as Federal holidays: 

Martin Luther King Jr. Day, observed on the Monday falling on or between January 15–21, commemorates the birthday of Dr. King, a significant leader of the Civil Rights Movement. The holiday was established federally in 1983 and first officially celebrated in 1986; efforts to create the holiday faced strong opposition and some southern states paired the new holiday with a holiday honoring the Confederacy
Juneteenth, observed on June 19, commemorates the announcement of the abolition of slavery in Texas in June 1865, and more generally the emancipation of enslaved African-Americans. The name is a portmanteau of June and nineteenth and has been a federal holiday since 2021.
Some states and cities have additional holidays honoring African-Americans:

Emancipation Day, observed in Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands on various days based on when enslaved people were emancipated in those jurisdictions
Harriet Tubman Day, observed in New York and in some parts of Maryland on March 10
Malcolm X Day, observed in Illinois and Berkeley, California, on May 19; also celebrated in cities such as Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. as an unofficial holiday
Rosa Parks Day, observed in Missouri on February 4, in California and Michigan on the following Monday, and in Ohio on December 1
A significant African-American cultural celebration is Kwanzaa, observed from December 26 to January 1. Created by Maulana Karenga in 1966, the holiday honors African heritage in African-American culture.

Confederate holidays
Some states celebrate holidays honoring the Confederate States of America that seceded from the United States. Many of these state holidays were created in the early twentieth century, fifty years after the end of the Civil War, as part of the myth of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy.

Confederate Memorial (or Heroes) Day is observed in Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, South Carolina, Louisiana and Texas on various days.
Robert E. Lee Day (on or around Lee's Jan 19 birthday) is still observed in Alabama and Mississippi combined with Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the only remaining states to do so. It is officially recognized in Florida, but is not widely observed there. Arkansas combined the observance of Robert E. Lee Day with Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1985. In 2017, the state passed a law removing Lee's name from the January holiday and instead establishing a state memorial day on the second Saturday of October in honor of Lee.
Confederate History Month has been declared at least once in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia as well as by various cities, usually in April to augment Confederate Memorial Day.

Other traditional and informal holidays
In addition to the federal/national holidays, many religious, ethnic, and other traditional holidays populate the calendar, as well as  lighter celebrations. These are rarely observed by businesses as holidays; indeed, many are viewed as opportunities for commercial promotion. Because of this commercialization, some critics apply the deprecatory term Hallmark holiday to such days, after the Hallmark greeting card company.
