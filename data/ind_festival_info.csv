He invited both of them to the new temple , Devi Bhramaramba agreed to travel with him. But she made a condition that no one should look back during the travel time. Devadas along with the people agreed her condition. While traveling people acknowledged the presence of Devi with her anklet sound but while crossing the river the sound of anklet is not audible so everyone turned and look back to check the presence of goddess. Devi god angry for breaking the promise and disappeared into the River. Devadas god worried and wounded himself with his sword . On seeing his devotion Devi Bhramaramba appeared as Devi Chowdeshwari and granted a boon that she will be there anytime when a person calls her with pure devotion.

It is a violent form of celebration where people from five villages fight with long bamboo sticks. Many devotees who participate in the fight get injured.

History
As per legends, Mani and Mallasura were two demons who lived in the hillock areas of Devaragutta. The demons regularly tortured the saints performing penance. The saints prayed to Lord Parameswara and Parvathi to save them from the demons. On the night of Vijayadashami, the lord took the form of moola virat in Kurmavatharam and appeared on the Devaragutta hillock to slay the demons. While dying, the demons prayed to be given human sacrifices every year which the lord denied and instead gave a fistful of blood in Rakshapada.

Rituals
Popularly known as the Banni festival of Sri Mala Malleswara Swamy temple in Devaragutta, it spans eleven days and culminates on the day of Vijaydashami where people from five villages form two separate groups to fight with each other for the purpose of claiming the idol of the deity.
The head priest commences the festival with Ganapati puja, Kankanadharana, Nischithartham for Mala Malleswara Swamy and Parvathi, and Dwajarohanam. Then the devotees offer prayers to Sri Mala Malleswara Swamy and Parvati, and carry the idols of the deities down the hillock. Thousands of devotees from the villages of Kothapeta, Neraniki Thanda, and Neraniki join the procession; they carry long sticks with metal ring tips and flaming torches to dance and perform feats.
At the same time, devotees from the rival villages of Yellarthi, Sullivan, Aluru, Netravatti, and Arizona prepare to divert the procession towards their villages as it is considered auspicious. Both groups of devotees clash, which often leads to injuries. The deities are taken to Padalakatta the next day where the temple head priest slits his thigh with a knife to offer the blood to Lord Mala Malleswara Swamy. The priest then addresses the gathered devotees and predicts the future of the villages as well as comments on the crops grown in the region.
The deities are taken to Simhasanakatta and the priest performs rituals to mark the end of that year’s Devaragutta Dasara festival.
People from nearby states such as Karnataka and Tamil Nadu travel to Devaragutta during the festival.

The Svarna Gauri Vrata (Svarṇagaurīvrata) is performed on the occasion to appease the goddess.

Svarna Gauri Vrata rituals
On this day, Women after bathing, wear new or smart clothes and dress up the girls of the family. Then they do the 'sthapana' of either jalagauri or arishinadagauri (a symbolic idol of Gauri made of turmeric). Painted and decorated clay idols of Gauri can be bought at the local market. The goddess' idol is mounted in a plate, with a cereal (rice or wheat) in it. As this puja or ritual is to be performed with 'shuchi' (cleanliness) and 'shraddhe' (dedication), the women go to temples or to another person's house, where it is performed according to set procedures or they can perform the ritual in their own homes.
A mantapa, generally decorated with banana stem and mango leaves, is built around the idol. The Gauri is decorated with garlands, decorations made of cotton, and women have a 'gauridara' (sacred thread with sixteen knots) tied to their right wrists, as blessings of the goddess and as part of the vrata. Each of the sixteen knots is worshipped with mantras during the performance of the religious practice.
An offering of baagina occurs during the festival. At least five baaginas are prepared as part of the vrata. Each baagina usually contains a packet of arshina (turmeric), kumkum, black bangles, black beads (used in the mangalsutra), a comb, a small mirror, baLe bicchoLe, coconut, blouse piece, dhaanya  (cereal), rice, toor dal, green dal, wheat or rava and jaggery cut in a cube form.
The baagina is offered in a traditional mora (winnow painted with turmeric). One such baagina is offered to Gauri and set aside. The remaining Gauri baaginas are given to the married women.

Gauri habbada mangaladravya
Another speciality of this festival is that the married woman's parents and brothers (tavaru maneyavaru) send all items required for worship (mangaladravya) to the married daughters of their family. Some send money as a substitute for mangaladravya. This good practice remains unchanged and keeps people closer. Newly-married women give sixteen pairs (jothe) baagina to married women (Sumangalis) and obtain their blessings. One baagina is kept for the Goddess Gauri (Gauramma). The main food items in this festival's feast are the delectable ""beLe hoLige"" / ""Kaayee-hoLige"", ""Huggi"" / ""Chitranna"" and ""Bajji"" .

Customs
Newlywed couples are invited to the house of their in-laws and served with festive food. In the olden days, newly-wed couples had to wait till Gauri Habba to consummate their marriage. The logic behind this practice is that if a child is conceived during Gauri Habba, which falls during the winter, the child would be born nine months later, during the summer, when it would be less prone to infections. This practice has been in place for years but has declined in recent times due to modernisation and wide contraceptive options.
Unmarried girls (kanya) in the house also wear a gauridara, but it doesn't have knots, just 16 strand cotton thread dipped in turmeric and a yellow chrysanthemum looped in it. These girls must give a variant of baagina to their own sisters, (and optionally to cousins whose mothers perform the vrata). This children's baagina consists of the decorative ornamental items (metal plastic or glass bangles, metal earrings, wearable necklace, in addition to comb, mirror, biccholay) the food items are omitted. This is given along with kumkuma (vermilion), betel leaf, betel nut, and fruit (small fruit other than coconut), and dakshine in small amount (gift money).

At least 27 pilgrims, 13 of them women, died and 20 others injured in a stampede at a major bathing spot on the banks of the Godavari river where a huge crowd of devotees had gathered on the opening day of 'Pushkaram' festival.

Etymology
""Maha"" means ""great"" and Pushkaram refers to the worship of the river in which the god Pushkar appears every 12 years. Pushakaram is spelled Pushkaralu in Telugu, Pushkaram in Tamil, Pushkara in Kannada, and Pushkar in Hindi.

Background
Pushkaram is an Indian festival dedicated to worshiping of 12 sacred rivers. The celebration happens annually, once in 12 years along each river. Each river is associated with a zodiac sign, and the river for each year's festival is based on which sign Bruhaspathi (Jupiter) is in at the time. It is believed that bathing in the sacred river during Pushkaram cleanses the devotees of their sins.
Godavari is one of the 12 sacred rivers, and the Godavari Pushkaram takes place once every 12 years, when the Jupiter is in the Leo sign. The Maha Pushkaram (""Great Pushkaram"") takes place once every 144 years.

Festival dates
The 2015 Godavari Pushkaram is believed to be a Maha Pushkaram, which happens once in 144 years. During the year 2015, Jupiter enters Leo on 14 July 2015 (Tuesday) at 6.26 AM, when the Maha Pushkaram begins, and ends after 12 days on 25 July 2015 (Saturday).
Multiple almanac writers and other skeptics have disputed that the 2015 Godavari Pushkaram is a ""Maha Pushkaram"". According to Hanmanthavajjula Subrahmanya Sarma, the president of State Drukghanitha Almanac Writers’ Association, the ""theory of 144 years is a myth"", and nobody knows ""who calculated it and how they calculated it"".

Details of locations
The places on the banks of the Godavari River where pilgrims visit famous temples are in the five districts of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The notable places are Manthani, Basar, Dharmapuri, Koti Lingala, Kaleshwaram, Bhadrachalam in Telangana and Rajahmundry, Kovvur, Narasapuram, Antarvedi in Andhra Pradesh.

Facilities
The Maha Pushkaram festival in 2015 attracted 4.81 crore people in Andhra Pradesh and 5.7 crore people in the Telangana state link from all parts of India. On this occasion, it is essential to take a holy dip in the Godavari River to get the supposed benefits of better physical and mental abilities. The Governments of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have made all arrangements for this event in their respective states by constructing ghats for bathing and improving road communications, basic amenities of water supply and sanitation, and security. In Andhra Pradesh. the budget allocated for improvement of infrastructure facilities is INR 1,295 crores.

Symbolism
An emblem titled ""Godavari Maha Pushkaram 2015"" and ""Godavari Pushkaramalu"" has been adopted by the state governments for this festival, and a special organization under the same name has also been instituted to address all issues related to the smooth functioning of the festive event. The emblem or logo with a simple design has lines to denote the rapid flow conditions of the Godavari River, a ""jyoti"" a glowing light, and the representation of offering oblation, called ""Arghyam"", to Surya, the Sun god.
Another symbolic event  proposed during the festival is to hold ""Sobha Yatra"", a procession carrying the sacred waters of the Godavari River to be mixed with water bodies in all the villages in the 13 districts which lie within the ambit of the Godavari River.
A religious symbolic performance called the ""Godavari Arathi"", a ritual of worship with a number of lamps is also proposed to be held at Rajahmundry where the river flows out to the sea.

Etymology
Gudi means 'flag'; according to Kittel, the term is of South Indian origin. The word pāḍavā is derived from the Sanskrit word pratipad for the first day of each fortnight in a lunar month, or the first day on which the moon appears after the ""new moon"" day (amāvāsya) and the first day after the full moon. A Gudhi is also hoisted on this occasion, gives this festival its name. The term padva or padavo is also associated with Balipratipada.

Significance
Gudi Padva signifies the arrival of spring and the reaping of rabi crops. The festival is linked to the day on which the Hindu god Brahma created time and the universe. To some, it commemorates the coronation of Rama in Ayodhya after his victory over Ravana, or the start of the Shalivahan calendar after he defeated the Huns in the first century. According to Anne Feldhaus, in rural Maharashtra, the festival is linked to Shiva's dance and the coming together of the community as they carry the Gudi Kavads together to a Shiva temple.

The guḍhī
During Gudi Padwa, gudi (or gudhi) are arranged at every household. It is a bright, colorful silk scarf-like cloth tied at the top of a long bamboo. On top of it, one or more boughs of neem and mango leaves are attached with a garland of flowers. It is capped with a silver, bronze, or copper pot (handi or kalash), signifying victory or achievement.
Some temples are located on the top of hills, and groups work together to help reach the kavad to the top.

Some of the significances attributed to raising a gudi are as follows:

It symbolises the victory of King Shalivahana and was hoisted by his people when he returned to Paithan.
It symbolises Brahma's flag mentioned in the Brahma Purana, and may also represent Indra's flag.
It is believed to ward off evil, invite prosperity and good luck into the house.

Festivities
Traditionally, families prepare a special dish that mixes various flavours, particularly the bitter leaves of the neem tree and sweet jaggery (gur, gul). Additional ingredients include sour tamarind and astringent dhane seeds. This, like the pacchadi recipe used in Ugadi festival, is eaten as a reminder of life's sweet and bitter experience and a belief that the neem-based mixture has health benefits.

Other names
The festival is also known as

Cheti Chand among the Sindhi people
Navreh among the Kashmiri Pandits in Jammu and Kashmir
Pahela Baishakh among the Bengalis in West Bengal and Bangladesh
Puthandu among the Tamils in Tamil Nadu
Samvatsar Padvo among Hindu Konkanis of Goa and Konkani diaspora in Kerala

Hindus regard this as the day the deity Vishnu assumed his fourth avatar in the form of a ""man-lion"", known as Narasimha, to vanquish the oppressive asura king Hiranyakashipu and protect his devotee Prahlada. The legend of Narasimha represents the victory of knowledge over ignorance and the protection offered by God to his devotees.

Legend
In Hindu mythology, Hiranyakashipu was the first incarnation of Jaya, one of the two doorkeepers of Vishnu's abode of Vaikuntha. After being cursed by the Four Kumaras, along with his brother, Vijaya, he chose to be born as an enemy of Vishnu thrice, rather than as a devotee of the deity seven times. After the death of his brother, Hiranyaksha, at the hands of Varaha, the third avatara of Vishnu, Hiranyakashipu swore revenge. The king performed a severe penance to propitiate the creator deity, Brahma, until the latter appeared to grant him a boon. The asura desired the inability to be slain neither inside his house nor outside, by day nor night, by any weapon, neither on the ground nor in the sky, by neither men nor beasts, deva nor asura, nor any being created by Brahma. He also asked for rulership of all living beings and the three worlds. His wish granted, Hiranyakashipu overran the three worlds with his invincibility and his forces, seizing the throne of Indra in Svarga, and subjugating all beings, except the Trimurti, under his rule.
Hiranyakashipu's son, Prahlada, grew devoted to Vishnu, due to spending his childhood at Narada's ashrama. Angered that his son prayed to his sworn enemy, Hiranyakashipu attempted to indoctrinate him under various teachers, including Shukra, but to no avail. The king determined that such a son must die. He employed poison, snakes, elephants, fire, and warriors to slay Prahlada, but the boy was saved by praying to Vishnu on each attempt. When the royal priests attempted to indoctrinate the prince once more, he converted the other pupils to Vaishnavism. The priests created a trishula (trident) to murder the boy, but it slew them instead, after which Prahlada restored them to life. Shambarasura and Vayu were tasked with killing him, but failed. Finally, the asura had his son tied to nooses of snakes, and hurled into the ocean, with mountains launched to crush him. Prahlada remained unscathed. Frustrated, Hiranyakashipu demanded to know where Vishnu resided, and Prahlada responded that he was omnipresent. He asked his son if Vishnu lived in a pillar of his chamber, and the latter affirmed in response. Furious, the king smashed the pillar with his mace, whence Narasimha, part-man, part-lion, appeared before him. The avatara dragged Hiranyakashipu to the doorway of the palace, and ripped him apart with his claws, his form placed upon his lap, during twilight. Thus, circumventing the boon granted to the asura king, Narasimha was able to rescue his devotee, and restore order to the universe.

History
Narasimha Jayanti is referenced in the Padma Purana and Skanda Purana as Narasimha Chaturdashi. The worship of Narasimha has been present in South India for millennia, with the Pallava dynasty popularising the sect and its practices. Inscriptions have also been found referring to the occasion dating back to the Vijayanagara Empire.

Religious practices and traditions
Narasimha Jayanti is primarily observed by Vaishnavas, the adherents of Vishnu, in the South Indian states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and northern Tamil Nadu, where the veneration of Narasimha is popular. Narasimha and Lakshmi Narasimha temples throughout the aforementioned regions hold special pujas in honour of the deity during various time periods of the occasion. In the household, the shodashopachara puja is performed in the morning, and the panchopachara puja is performed in the evening, both by men.
Members of the Sri Vaishnava tradition traditionally observe fasting until the evening, and consume food after prayer. A beverage called panakam is prepared from jaggery and water, and is distributed to the Brahmins during the festivities. 
In Karnataka, community feasts are organised by certain temples to celebrate the occasion.

Bhagavata Mela
Every year on Narasimha Jayanti, a traditional folk dance known as the bhagavata mela is publicly performed in Melattur, a village in Tamil Nadu. The term ""bhagavata"" refers to the Bhagavata Purana, a prominent Hindu text in the Vaishnava tradition, while ""mela"" refers to traditional dancers or singers. Thus, this folk dance enacts stories from the Bhagavata Purana using specific dance techniques and karnatāka musical style. One particular performance that is ""noteworthy for its dramatic impact and ritual significance"" is the story of Prahlada and Narasimha.

Festival
Villagers of Kairuppala traditionally observe the cow dung fight and the marriage between the two gods by holding an annual cow dung fight on the day after Ugadi. The village is split into two sides: the Dalit, Kuruba and Yadava communities on one side representing Bhadrakali; and the Lingayat, Muslim and Reddy communities on the other representing Virabhadra.
Hundreds of people take part in the fight. There is a large police presence at the festival in order to avoid seriously unruly incidents. Injuries do occur, but no complaints are filed. After the end of the fight, the village celebrates the marriage of Virabhadra and Bhadrakali, together. Celebrations at Kallur in Kurnool city have their own significance. Annually, donkeys from over the city are forced to walk three times around the Chowdeswari Temple in a 3-foot-deep (0.91 m) puddle of mud made for that purpose, then they are washed, decorated and worshiped. Devotees gather in large numbers at the temple to witness this ritual, which is believed to bring peace to the city.

Legend
According to local folklore, before a marriage between the goddess Bhadrakali and the god Virabhadra, there was a dispute. Sources appear to vary regarding the basis of the dispute: The Hans India states that Bhadrakali was angered by Virabhadra's unexpected advances and threatened to throw cow dung at him, while The New Indian Express states that the couple was separated for some time following an affair. At one point, villagers supporting Bhadrakali began throwing cow dung at Virabhadra, and villagers supporting Virabhadra responded with cow dung as well. The fight lasted for about an hour before the leaders of the village settled the situation and the marriage between the two gods was held.

Recent years
In 2012, about 15 people were injured, but no complaints were filed. In 2022, a local official reported that up to 50 people sustained injuries, but the police received no complaints. In 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic in India, despite India suffering one of the world's worst outbreaks and experiencing a recent surge in cases at the time, special permission to hold the festival was granted. That year, a video of a crowd of maskless festivalgoers throwing cow dung during a pandemic sparked outrage online. A police official stated that about 100 people were injured, but no one complained.

History
It was during 1757, when the king Pusapati Peda Vijaya Rama Raju of Vizianagaram was busy in the Battle of Bobbili, second Anand has taken the charge of crown and died in the year 1760. His wife also died along with him in Sati (practice). Then the wife of Peda Vijaya Rama Raju, Rani Chandrayamma has adopted Vijaya Rama Raju who belonged to Vizianagaram dynasty as per history.
If we go through the history of 104 temples constructed by Vizianagar Sanstan some history of those temples can be known by virtue of their location. But there is no specific history about Sri Pydithalli Ammavaru temple constructed by this sansthan. According to local legend, Pydithalli Ammavaru is the Grama Devata (presiding deity) of Vizianagaram. Some say that this Ammavaru is a sister of Maharanis of Vizianagaram. But there are many evidences that Pydithalli Ammvaru belongs to Vizianagaram dynasty. Even though there are no reliable evidence about birth and other details of Pydimamba, as per the local legend, an idol of Pydimamba was found on the west side of Pedda Cheruvu of Vizianagaram on the first Tuesday, following Vijaya Dasami after completion of battle of Bobbili.
It was in 1750 when the French leader Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau was staying with entire battalion near Hyderabad. Many soldiers died due to Small Pox (Masuchi). He was going through a financial crisis. Peda Vijaya Rama Raju of Vizianagaram helped him to overcome it and rebuild his battalion. In 1756 Bussy visited Rajahmundry. It is rumored that Vijaya Rama Raju gave a warm welcome to Bussy at Rajahmundry.
At that time Bobbili Maharajas were more powerful. There are some differences between Bobbili and Vizianagaram Rajas. Because of those differences and some other reasons Battle of Bobbili started on 23 January 1757. During the battle entire Bobbili fort got destroyed and many Bobbili soldiers died in the battle. The wife of Vijaya Rama Raju and Sister Sri. Pydimamba tried to stop the battle by hearing the news but were not successful. By that time, only Sri Pydimamba, sister of Vijayaramaraju was suffering from Small Pox. While she was in the puja of Goddess she learned that Vijayaramaraju was in trouble. She wanted to inform her brother regarding this and tried to convey the message through Vizianagaram soldiers, but every one was in the battle. She started with Patiwada Appalanaidu to convey the message in a horse cart. But, by that time, she got the news that his brother Vijaya Rama Raju died in the hands of Tandrapapa Rayudu, She became unconscious. Patiwada Applanaidu sprinkled water over her face and she regained consciousness and told Appalanaidu that she will not live anymore and She is going to merge with the village Goddess. Her statue will be found at the west bank of Pedda Cheruvu (A pond located at the heart of Vizianagaram lies to the west of Vizianagaram Fort). The fishermen found the idol of Pydimamba and constructed a temple called Vanam Gudi for goddess, opposite to Vizianagaram Railway Station which was the first temple for Pydimamba, the second temple is located at Three Lanterns junction.

Procession
Sirimanu Utsav is being celebrated every year on the first Tuesday following Vijayadasami. Sirimanu means a big trunk. It is believed that approximately 15 days before Sirimanu Utsav, goddess Pydimamba would come in the dream of temple Pujari and tell him where the Sirimanu for that year could be found. Pujari would go in search of Sirimanu and will cut the Sirimanu after performing traditional puja. That Sirimanu can be located anywhere. The owner must agree to cut his tree for Utsav. That tree will be shaped neatly into Sirimanu and will be placed over the chariot. This Sirimanu will be brought to the Three Lanters junction around 2:00 pm. Temple Pujari will pay obeissance to the Goddess before taking his seat on the Sirimanu chariot. This sirimanu will move 3 times between Vizianagaram fort and Pydimamba temple between 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm. There will be a chariot in the shape of White elephant in front of Srimanu. The Vizianagaram Rajahs will sit in the front Tower of the fort and watch the Utsav. Pujari will be presented with new clothes by Rajas and puja is performed.

Importance of the White Elephant
Many people do not know about the White Elephant moving in front of Sirimanu chariot. But in the olden days Maharajas used to sit on a white elephant and participate in Sirimanu Utsav. Now statue of white elephant is taken in procession in front of Sirimanu as a part of tradition.

Importance of Anjali Chariot
Sri Pydimamba died before she got married. So five married women will be seated on the Anjali chariot which goes in front of Sirimanu as a part of tradition. As five married women are sitting on this chariot, this is called Anjali chariot. In addition, Paladhara, an umbrella made with fishing nets decorated with flowers and fruits is another important accompaniment to the Anjali Chariot.

Importance of Paladhara and Fishermen's net
As per history, when Goddess statue was found on west side of Pedda Cheruvu, Patiwda Appalanaidu tried to bring the statue out by calling professional swimmers of Yata Veedhi. They agreed to bring the statue out without taking money on the condition that their people would be allowed to participate in the srimanu utasav with umbrella made of fishing nets. Patiwada Appalanaidu agreed to their condition and convinced Rajas to permit them to participate in Sirimanothsavam.

Etymology
The word Brahmotsavam is a combination of two Sanskrit words—Brahma and utsavam (festival)—and Brahma reportedly conducted the first festival. Brahma also means ""grand"" or ""large"". Srivari Brahmotsavam is also known as ""Venkateswara Salakatla Brahmotsavams"" and ""Venkateswara Navaratri Brahmotsavams"".

Two festivals
When there is an extra month in the Telugu calendar, two Brahmotsavam are held viz., Salakatla and Navarathri. Both festivals were held in 2015, 2018, 2020 and 2023
Brahmotsavam 2024
This year, in 2024, since there is no Adhika Maasa, there will only be one Brahmotsavam, which is the annual Salakatla Brahmotsavam. 
The Salakatla Brahmotsavam and the Navaratri Brahmotsavam will be held together..
The TTD Brahmotsavam 2024 will take place from October 3 to October 12.

In Salakatla Brahmotsavam, Rathotsavam (Big Chariot) is held on the morning of the eighth day; during Navaratri Brahmotsavam, Golden Chariot (Swarna Rathotsavam) is held that morning of the eighth day. In Salakatla Brahmotsavam, there will be flag hoisting (Dwajarohanam) on 1st day and flag-lowering (Dwajaavarohanam) on the evening of the ninth day.

History and legend
According to the legend of Tirumala, Brahma descends to earth to conduct the festival. Sri Venkteswara Sahasranamastotra refers to Brahma performing the festival, signified by a small, empty wooden chariot (brahmaratham) which moves ahead of the processions of the Venkateswara processional deity Malayappa.
The first reference to festivals in the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple was in 966 CE, when the Pallava queen Samavai endowed land and ordered its revenue to celebrate festivals in the temple. Until 1582, Brahmotsavams were held as often as 12 times a year.

Celebrations
The Brahmotsavam is held over nine days at the beginning of the Hindu calendar month of Āśvina, paralleling Navaratri. The evening before the first day, the rite of Ankurarpana (the sowing of seeds to signify fertility and abundance) is performed. The main first-day activity is Dwajarohana, the raising of the Garuda flag to signify the beginning of the festival. Religious activities during the festival include daily homas and processions on streets surrounding the temple. The final day commemorates Venkateswara's birth star. The Sudarshana Chakra is bathed in the temple tank with the devotees. The Chakra is then placed on a high platform, and the devotees walk under it and are blessed with its dripping water. The festival ends with Dhvajavarohanam, the lowering of the Garuda flag.

Dwajarohanam
A ceremony on the first day, when a flag with a picture of Garuda (the vehicle of Vishnu) is hoisted over the temple. The flag is believed to be a symbolic invitation to the Hindu deities to attend the festival. After the ceremony, the Andhra Pradesh chief minister offers new silk clothes to Venkateswara.
Garuda Vahanam
On the evening of the fifth day, Venkateswara and Garuda are carried in a procession and decorated with garlands of flowers. Every year, the Tirupati Venkateswara garland is sent to the Srivilliputtur Andal Temple for the marriage festival of Andal.
Hanumantha Vahanam
On the morning of the sixth day morning, Venkateswara and Hanuman are taken out in procession.
Chakra Snanam
On the morning of the ninth day, the Malayappa, his two consorts and the Sudarshana Chakra are carried in procession to the Varahaswamy Temple. After the abhishekam and presentation of food offerings, the Sudarshana Chakra and its devotees are bathed in the temple tank.

This folk festival is celebrated grandly at the Tirupati city famous temple of Goddess Gangamma (sister of lord Venkateshwara) called Tataiahgunta Gangamma Temple located on the east side of Tirupati city .

Legend
Sri Tataiahgunta Gangamma is Grama Devatha of Tirupati city. Once upon a time when Tirupati and surrounding areas were ruled by Palegondulu, harassment of women was enormous – they used to rape and harass any woman seen. During this time, in a village ""Avilala"", the Goddess Gangamma was born and grew into a beautiful woman. When the Palegondulu wanted to harm Goddess Gangamma, she with her grace and power was about to kill him. Palegondulu, fearing her, hid in a remote place. 
To take him out of hiding, the Gangamma planned ""Ganga Jathara"" where the people in Tirupathi do vichitra veshadarana and curse Gangamma for a period of 7 days. On the seventh day, the Palegondulu comes out of hiding and was killed by Goddess Gangamma for the LokaKalyanam (well being of all people).

About
Ganga Jatara, the folk festival of Tirupati, begins with the formal Chatimpu (announcement) around midnight of Tuesday. The Gangamma Jatara is held by the viswakarma Mirasi Achari family – Eepuri Devarjuluachari and Kasi shankara Achari take charge of Jatara festival and make all arrangements.
The Gangamma Jatara is a very famous local festival for the people of Tirupati. It is done every year in May. As the Gangamma temple was in the banks of Thathaya gunta, the temple is famously known as ""Tataiahgunta Gangamma Temple"".
Priests performed the initiatory rituals and tied `Vadibalu' to the `Viswaroopa Sthambam' in front of the temple, that set the stage for the fete. Men making the Chatimpu roam through the old town beating dappus to announce that the festival has begun and hence the residents should not leave the town till the festival is over.
Priests make the traditional huge clay idol of the goddess at the temple's portico. Everyone during the festival comes and prays to the goddess to offer her pongal, sarees, turmeric and kumkum, etc.
During the last day of festival, the portico will be smashed it into pieces at the auspicious moment. Devotees then clamour around to get the clay smithereens, which they consider as sacred, to be either preserved in the ‘Puja' room or consumed by mixing it in water. Though there is a ban on animal sacrifice, goats and fowls were chopped at will at a corner of the temple.
This festival is being celebrated on 13, 14 and 15 May every year, in most of the areas in undivided chittoor district (like Tirupati, Chittoor and Palamaner  etc.), Andhra Pradesh, India.

The Festival
Day 0: Chatimpu

The day after chatimpu is Bhairagi Vesham. On this day, (Wednesday) people used to smear their body with white color paste (Namam Kommu) and wear a garland made of ""Rella kaya"" (fruit). They will hold neem leaves with the hand and also tie their waist with neem leaves. Devotees will walk to the temple through the city and will leave those neem leaves and Rella Kaya graland there at the temple after the darshan of the Goddess. Devotees will do such procession on each day for the rest of the festival duration.

Day 6: Sunnapu kundalu
On the sixth day of the festival, the devotees anoint their body with white paste and apply dots with charcoal. And carries a pot (Veyyi kalla Dutta) on their head. Upon reaching the temple the devotees goes around the temple three times carrying the pot on their head. Leaves the pot there in the temple after the 3rd round and go for the goddess Darshan.

Day 7: Gangamma Jatara
The last day of the festival is celebrated as Ganga Jatara. During this day, all Gangamma temples in Tirupati are flocked with lakhs of devotees. People used to visit the temple and offer ""pongallu"" and/or Sarees to Gangamma. Few Devotees used to have darshan of Gangamma by wearing ""Sapparalu"" (A special gopuram like object made of bamboo) along with ""Dappu Vaidyam"" (A musical instrument). ""Ragi Ambali"" is served to the devotees visiting temples all over the city.
After midnight, a clay idol of Gangamma (Viswaroopam) is installed in front of the Temple. A guy will dress up like ""Perantallu"" and will remove the chempa (cheek) of viswaroopam which is referred to as ""Chempa Tholagimpu"". The clay is later distributed to the Devotees who are believed to have curing powers. By this event the entire seven-day Jatara will come to an end.

Offerings
Animals
Devotees offer the goddess goats and hens.

Pongal
Women prepare pongal (a dish prepared with rice, mung beans and sugar) in the temple and offer it to the goddess.

Walking on knees
Similarly, there is another practice for women to come on their knees from their homes to the temple. First, they roll a coconut on the road and then walk on their knees up to the point, pick up the coconut and roll it again. These practices bear testimony to the strong faith the native residents of Tirupati have in the goddess.

It also falls sometimes on the day after Amavasya with 27th Nakshatra Revati. Ugadi day is pivoted on the first New Moon after March Equinox.
The day is observed by drawing colourful patterns on the floor called Muggulu/ Rangoli, mango leaf decorations on doors called torana, buying and giving gifts such as new clothes, giving charity to the poor, oil massages followed by special baths, preparing and sharing a special food called pachadi, and visiting Hindu temples.

The same day is observed as a New Year by Hindus in many other parts of India, such as Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra, Goa and is a national public holiday in Mauritius.

Etymology
The name Yugadi or Ugadi is derived from the Sanskrit words yuga (age) and ādi (beginning): ""the beginning of a new age"". Yugadi or Ugadi falls on ""Chaitra Shudhdha Paadyami"" or the first day of the bright half of the Indian month of Chaitra. This generally falls in late March or early April of the Gregorian calendar.
The Telugu people use the term Ugadi (ఉగాది) and the Kannadigas use the term Yugadi (ಯುಗಾದಿ) for this festival.

Practices
The Kannada and Telugu communities in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu celebrate the festival with great fanfare; gatherings of the extended family and a sumptuous feast are 'de rigueur'. The day begins early with ritual showers, rubbing the body with perfumed oil, followed by prayers.

Preparations for the festival begin a week ahead. Houses are given a thorough clean. People buy new clothes, including dhoti, and buy new items for the festival, decorate the entrance of their houses with fresh mango leaves. Mango leaves and coconuts are considered auspicious in the Hindu tradition, and they are used on Ugadi. People also clean the front of their house with water and cow dung paste, then draw colorful floral designs. People offer prayers in temples. The celebration of Ugadi is marked by religious zeal and social merriment. According to Vasudha Narayanan, a professor of Religion at the University of Florida:

The pacchadi festive dish symbolically reminds the people that the following year – as all of life – will consist of not just sweet experiences, but a combination of sweet, sour, salty, and bitter episodes. Just as the different substances are bound together, one is reminded that no event or episode is wholly good or bad. Even in the midst of bitter experiences, there are sweet moments. One is also reminded that the experience of taste is transitory and ephemeral; so too, is life, and one has to learn to put pain and pleasure in proper temporal perspective.

Special dishes are prepared for the occasion. In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, foods such as pulihora, bobbatlu (Bhakshalu/ polelu/ oligale), New Year Burelu and Pachadi, and preparations made with raw mango go well with the occasion. Of these, pachadi (or Ugadi pacchadi) is the most notable, and consists of a chutney-like dish which combines ingredients to give all six flavours of food : sweet, sour, salty, spicy, bitter and astringent. This festive Hindu food is made from tamarind paste (sour), neem flowers (bitter), brown sugar or sweet jaggery (sweet), table salt (salt), green chilli (spicy) and raw mango (astringent). It is a symbolic reminder of complex phases of life one should reasonably expect in the new year.
In Karnataka, foods such as Holige or Obattu, and mango pickles are made. In addition, a speciality of yugadi in Karnataka is to create ""bEvu-bella"" a mixture of neem and jaggery, to signify both the sweet and the bitter or the sihi-kahi(ಸಿಹಿ-ಕಹಿ). This symbolizes life's own experiences with a little bit of bitterness and a hint of sweetness.

Related festivals
Maharashtran Hindus refer to the festival, observed on the same day, as Gudi Padwa (Marathi: गुढी पाडवा). The Sindhis celebrate the same day as Cheti Chand, which is the beginning of their calendar year. Manipuris also celebrate their New Year as Sajibu Nongma Panba on the same day.
The Hindus of Bali in Indonesia also celebrate their new year on the same day as Nyepi. Ugadi is one of the five Hindu national public holidays in Mauritius.

It is observed on the 11th lunar day of the waxing lunar fortnight of the solar month of Dhanu. This falls between 16 December and 13 January in the Gregorian calendar.

Legend
The origin of Vaikuntha Ekadashi is mentioned in a legend of the Padma Purana. There was once an asura named Murāsura, who was a nightmare to the devas, owing to a boon he had received from Brahma. They sought the assistance of Vishnu, who fought against the asura in a battle, but was unable to defeat him. He travelled to a cave called Simhavati in the vicinity of Badarikashrama, where he was pursued by Murāsura. There, Vishnu summoned Yogamaya, a goddess created from his divine energy, who slew the asura. Vishnu, who was pleased, offered the goddess the epithet 'Ekadashi', and declared that she would be capable of vanquishing the sins of all the people of Earth. In Vaishnava tradition, it is held all those who observe a fast on the occasion and worship Ekadashi would attain Vaikuntha. Thus came into being the first Ekadashi, which was a Dhanurmasa Shukla Paksha Ekadashi.
According to a later story, there was once a Vaishnava king of Ayodhya called Ambarisha, who always maintained his vow of fasting for the occasion. Once, after three days of fasting for the occasion, he was about to break his fast, when the sage Durvasa appeared at his city's gates. The king received the sage with honour, and offered him a meal, which the latter accepted, but went first to perform his ritual ablutions. Even as Ambarisha waited for a long while, the sage did not return, and the auspicious moment of breaking his fast approached. He faced a dilemma: If he did not break his fast before the day was over, the act of his fasting would not bear fruit; However, if he ate a single morsel of food before Durvasa returned, that was regarded as disrespectful. He decided to simply sip some water, which broke his fast, but was hoped to not prove to seem insulting to the sage. Durvasa was infuriated when he returned, and tore a clump of hair from his head, which was sent charging to attack the king. The Sudarshana Chakra of Vishnu intervened to destroy the clump, which then proceeded to chase the sage. Durvasa fled, attempting to seek the protection of Brahma and Shiva, but the two deities denied him refuge. Finally, Durvasa begged for his life from Vishnu himself, who informed him that his salvation lay at the hands of his devotees. Accordingly, Durvasa sought forgiveness from Ambarisha, and was saved.
According to another legend, Vishnu opened the gate of Vaikuntha (his abode) for two asuras (demons) in spite of their being against him. They also asked for this boon: Whoever listens to their story, and sees the image of Vishnu coming out of the door called Vaikuntha Dvaram, would reach Vaikuntha as well. Temples all over India make a door kind of structure on this day for devotees to walk through.

Significance
Vaishnavism
Vaishnavas (Devotees of Vishnu) believe that ‘Vaikuntha Dvaram’ (the gate to Vaikuntha) is opened on this day. The Margashirsha Shukla Paksha Ekadashi in the Lunar calendar is known as a 'Mokshada Ekadashi.' Special prayers from the Vedas, Naalayira Divya Prabandham, Vaikuntha Gadyam as well as the Vaikuntha Dvara Puja, Prakarothsvam (Sri Veli), Oonjal Seva (swing pooja), Oonjal Prabhandham, yagnas, discourses, and speeches are arranged at several Vishnu temples around the world on this auspicious day.
Vaikuntha refers to the abode of the Hindu preserver deity, Vishnu. Vaishnavas consider the feet of Vishnu to be Vishnupada, or Parama Padam (Ultimate feet), as it is regarded to be the realm for Vishnu and his devotees to reside in the suddha-sattva, or the supreme state of purity and goodness.
In Vishnu temples, Vaikuntha Ekadashi is part and parcel of Dhanurmasam (Margaḻi) vratam and its puja. Fasting for the entire month of Dhanurmasam is practised by several Vaishnavas, including temperance and food restrictions for Sri Vaishnavas.
According to the Vishnu Purana, fasting on Vaikuntha Ekadashi is equivalent to fasting on the remaining 23 ekadashis of the (Hindu) year. However, according to Vaishnava tradition, fasting is mandatory on all ekadashis of both Shukla paksha and Krishna paksha. Fasting on Ekadashi is considered holier than any other religious observation.  Complete fasting has to be observed on Ekadashi, the 11th day of the paksha. That is why the meal on the Dvadashi (the 12th day) is designed to be wholesome, nutritious, and filling.

Fasting
Vaikuntha Ekadashi fasting is an important aspect of those associated with it. People fast the whole day and keep vigil. Special prayers are offered to Vishnu and devotees engage in Japa (chanting of Vishnu's name) and Dhyana (Meditation). On 'Dashami', the previous day of the observance, devotees who take up Vaikuntha Ekadashi fasting are to take only lunch. On Ekadashi, the next day, they have to maintain a complete fast and engage in prayers and meditation of Vishnu. They are strictly prohibited from taking rice. That night, people keep vigil the whole night and visit the temple of Vishnu, mostly in the wee hours of the morning.
The Shaiva sect observes the day as Trikoti Ekadashi, a religious observance where adherents regard it to be the date when all the deities in the Hindu pantheon pay obeisance to Shiva.

Celebrations
The celebrations of the occasion span across all Venkateswara temples. The most important for this particular festival is considered to be in Srirangam which is specifically known for the Svarga Vasal opening. The next most important is considered to be in Tirupati in the Tirumala hills, which houses the highly venerated abode of Venkateswara.

Srirangam
At the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam Vaikuntha Ekadashi celebrations last for 20 days, divided into two parts: pagal pathu (morning part 10 days) and Ira pathu (night part 10 days). Vishnu, as the mulavar (central temple idol) of Ranganatha, is regarded to bless devotees in his Muthangi, an armuor of pearls, on all 20 days. On the 10th day of Pagal Pathu (previous day of Vaikuntha Ekadashi), the utsavar (processional idol), named Namperumal, is believed to bless devotees, in his form as Mohini.
On Vaikuntha Ekadashi, during daybreak, Namperumal is regarded to bless devotees, clad in an armour of diamonds and gems, and brought to the thousand-pillared hall from the sanctum sanctorum, through the northern gate known as Paramapada Vasal, the gate to Vaikuntha. This gate is opened once in a year, only on the occasion of Vaikuntha Ekadashi. It is said that anyone who goes through the Paramapada Vasal will attain Vaikuntha. For this reason, it is also known as the Svarga Vasal.

Tirupati
The Tirumala Venkateswara Temple also has a similar concept to celebrate Mukkoti Ekadasi, as it is known in the Telugu-speaking regions. Tirumala has a special entrance called Vaikunta Dvaram that encircles the sanctum sanctorum. The dvaram (gateway) is opened only on Vaikunta Ekadasi, and it is believed that any person who passes through this 'Vaikunta Dvaram' on this particular day attains Vaikunta. The temple witnesses heavy inflow of pilgrims and dignitaries for Vaikunta Ekadashi.

Nyokum has been derived from the combination of two words - Nyok means land (earth) and Kum means collectiveness  or togetherness. Therefore, the Nyokum festival may very well be interpreted as inviting all the Gods and Goddesses of the universe, with the Nyokum Goddess as the principal deity, to a particular venue at a particular time. The festival is commonly celebrated by the people from all class and walk of life for better productivity, prosperity and happiness of all human beings.","Nyokum is a festival celebrated by the Nyishi tribe of the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh. The Word 
Nyokum has been derived from the combination of two words - Nyok means land (earth) and Kum means collectiveness  or togetherness. Therefore, the Nyokum festival may very well be interpreted as inviting all the Gods and Goddesses of the universe, with the Nyokum Goddess as the principal deity, to a particular venue at a particular time. The festival is commonly celebrated by the people from all class and walk of life for better productivity, prosperity and happiness of all human beings.

Significance
The festival has a close link with cultivation. The Nyokum goddess, the goddess of prosperity is invoked for her blessings so that there may be more and more production of food-grains in the next harvesting season, that the visit of famine may be warded off, and that drought or flood may not hamper cultivation, nor should any insect or animal destroy plants and crops. The Goddess is invoked so that the human race may be strengthened and regenerated. All should be free from unnatural death due to accident, war and epidemic.

Ui or Oram Nyoko is the place meant for the life after death. It is also believed that there are numerous deities and spirits on earth. These are the deities and spirits of mountains, rivers, forest, animals crops, household and so on and so forth. Some of the spirits are benevolent and others are malevolent. The Nyishi believe that human being's can live a life of peace and prosperity on this earth only when a perfect harmony is maintained between man, God and nature. They also believe that prosperity and happiness can come to a man when God and nature are pleased. Misery, hardship and natural calamities like famine, flood, drought, earthquake, epidemic, warfare, accidental death and such unwanted incidents occur due to the displeasure and wrath of the God and Goddess of nature. It is, therefore, the Nyishi worship to propitiate the benevolent Gods and Goddess to protect and bring prosperity to them and to ward off the malevolent spirits from disturbing the peace and tranquility in their life, Nyokum Yullow is one of such propitiation.

Rituals
The main prayer structure of the Nyishi is made of bamboo, called the yugang. Alongside the yugang sacrificial animals are tethered. Like cows, mithuns, and goats. Often one finds small chickens hung from bamboo poles of the yugang. The nyubh or the traditional priest specifies the number and kinds of animals for sacrifice, or any other offering to be made. There are no idols in this worship. Neither is there any permanent structure. Besides the animal sacrifice, beer made from millet seeds and rice paste is used.
People turn up wearing their traditional clothes during this time. The men dress in a cotton eri robe draped from the shoulder and reaching the thighs. From their neck hangs a variety of bead jewellery necklaces. Often semi precious stones like turquoise adorn these necklaces. The men's attire is topped by a bamboo woven cap on the head. This cap is decorated with feathers or furs of wild animals. The beak of the hornbill is a favorite ornament for the traditional cap. The women also dress in their finery of par ej, earrings bead necklaces, topped with a headdress made of finely scaped bamboo.
There is singing and dancing before the head priest or nyubh comes with his attendants to perform the main ritual. Guests are welcomed with rice paste powder, and opo or millet seed beer which is scooped in dried gourd ladles. The song and dance are performed in a group. Usually men and women hold hands in a circular form and sing and dance these lines Nyokum bo tapa debe. And sometimes men dance mock fights with dao (short sword) and shield made of animal hide.

Rikham Pada the Folk Dance of the Nyishi Tribe
Rikham Pada means giant, handsome, undefeatable and matured man
Rinyam Yami means young and handsome looking boy
Both Rikham Pada and Rinyam Yami were two brothers.
They (Rikham Pada & Rinyam Yami) were attire with beautiful traditional dresses which adding up their handsomeness, the most beautiful girls of the universe were after them. So marriage proposals were impending like shooting star, flowing of pure and milky river water,
Rikham Pada was man of principle, therefore he rejected them. So their imagination of marrying to Rikham pada was depicting in the form of song and dances.

It is held according to the Buddhist calendar days of 28th to 30th of Dawachukchipa, which corresponds to 10 to 12 January of the Gregorian calendar, and is a Monpa celebration. The objective of the festival is to ward off any kind of external aggression and to protect people from natural disasters.

Features
In the three-day festival, costumed dances are very popular and held in the courtyard of the monastery with the objective of removing evil spirits and usher all round prosperity and happiness to the people in the ensuing year. The popular dances performed with artists donning colorful costumes and masks are: the Pha Chan and the Losjker Chungiye, the latter is performed by the monks of the monastery. Each dance represents a myth and costumes and masks represent animal forms such as cows, tigers, sheep, monkeys and so forth.
The first day's festival is called Torgya and involves worship of the image created specially for the occasion. The creation of the images starts 16 days prior to the festival. The image is created to a height of 3 feet (0.91 m) with a width of 2 feet (0.61 m), and is exclusively crafted by 14 lamas of the monastery. Right from day one of making the image till it is completed, scriptures are recited by the monks of the monastery to the accompaniment of beating of drums by another group of lamas. The ingredients used for making the image are ghee, barley, milk and molasses, and it is done in honour of Lama Tsongkapa. The quantity of barley used in making the image will be more than other ingredients. The image is named as Torma. Concurrent with the making of the image, dry bamboo leaves are gathered from distant places and formed into a mound, in the shape of a temple, which is known as ""Mechang"". The Head Lama (Khambu) of the monastery burns the Mechang in the presence of other Lamas.
At the same time, the image ""Torma"" is brought out in a procession to the location of the mound. It is carried by Lamas of the monastery, known as Arpo, wearing bells around their waist. Two other Lamas also accompany the Torma, one wearing a male mask made of yak horn and the other wearing a female mask, also made of yak horn. These two Lamas are called the Choige yap-yum ('yap' meaning ""male"" and 'yum' meaning ""female""); this is supposed to signify the male and female servants of Lama Tsongkapa. The procession of the Torma is accompanied by other Lamas carrying swords, beating drums and cymbals. On reaching the location of the Mechang, the Torma is ritually touched by the Head Lama, and then consumed into the flaming fire of the Mechang. The practice of touching the Torma by the Head Lama is called the Sangonna-Torgya. On completion of this religious practice, the Head Lama returns to the Monastery accompanied by other Lamas.
The ritual on the final day of the festival is known as ""Wang"" performed at the monastery. On this occasion, sweets called Tseril are prepared by mixing barley and sugar or molasses and then solidifying it, which is then made into small balls. Prayers are then offered by the Head Lama, which is followed by distribution of the Tseril. Along with the sweets, local beer called Tse-Chang is also served in a bowl made of human skull. The oblation of Tse-Chang is distributed in a very small quantity, of say a few drops to the devotees. After this ritual, the Head Lama gives blessings, called the Tse-Boom. He blesses all the assembled devotees by touching their heads; during this process the other lamas tie small strips of cloth, of half to one inch width, of white, red or blue or other colors, on the wrist of devotees. Concurrently, strips of yellow cloth are tied by a senior Lama around the neck of all lamas and Anis (nuns), as a sign of blessings for happiness and long life.

This tradition that dates back two centuries, livens up the small town of Jamugurihat.

History
Barechaharia Bhaona has changed a lot in the 220 years since its inception, when Hukai Dekagiri first organised it at Raghudoloni-Pothar (paddy field) of the village Pasigaon in present day Jamugurihat of Assam in 1797. This festival is celebrated every five years on the full moon day of Chot (usually in March or April) as per the Assamese Calendar. Recently however, locals have agreed to celebrate this event on the full moon day of Fagoon (usually in February or March) to avoid conflict with the April Bordoichila (""thunderstorm""). 
Typically the Bhaona is a dramatization of stories from Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Puranas. However, in this style created by the Mahapurush Sankardev, a Vaishnavite saint is depicted with Bhakti Rasa in the form of different Raga & Tala. The saint's main goal was to bring together the diverse society through entertainment and share the teachings of Vaishnavism. The blending of religion and culture has helped this festival last over the years, while keeping its storytelling alive.

Bhaona customs
The Bhaona is held in a Namghar, the traditional prayer house of a village unit called Khel, and also in Sattras, a monastery-like institution promoting the Sankari culture, founded by Sankardev. In the traditional Bhaona, there are a group singers and drummers who begin the orchestra (Jora) in Sankari style followed by the entry of Sutradhar who recites slokas and narrates the entire story of the drama to be performed. The director, known as Gayanbora, lets other performers know when to make their entry onto the stage. Nam prasanga meanskirtana also is an integral part of the Bhaona. Brajabuli is used to script the dialogues. The concept of Barechaharia Bhaona is derived from the traditional Bhaona and in this festival, unlike other Bhaona, it is performed simultaneously by teams from the different villages of the region on several stages with the holy altar in the center.

History
Indigenous origin
The word Bihu has been derived from the Deori (a Boro-Garo language)  word Bisu which means ""excessive joy"".  original form of Bihu continue among the  Chutias, Sonowal Kacharis, Thengal Kacharis  and Deoris. These groups, known as Sadiyal Kacharis were associated with the historical Kingdom of Sadiya. The other branches of Bodo-Kacharis which include Boros, Dimasas, Rabhas, Tiwas, etc. have also been celebrating Bihu since ancient times. The Boros call it Baisagu, while the Dimasas, Tiwa and Rabha call it Bushu or Bushu Dima,Pisu, Dumsi respectively.
In local folklore, it is said that Bordoisila (Bardai Sikhla in Bodo) (meaning north-westerly winds in Assamese) was the daughter of God Earth who married to a bridegroom of some distant land. Bordoisila visits her mother's home once in year during spring time which indicates the beginning of Bihu and leaves after a few days which indicates the end of Bihu. Assam experience strong gale (wind) at that period which marks the beginning of Bihu and another strong gale after her departure which is devastating. The word Bordoisila is derived from the Bodo word Bordaisikhla which means ""girl of storm"" (Sikhla meaning girl and Bardai meaning storm). There is even a dance with the same name performed among Boro people during Baisagu which points to the origin of Bihu in the Bodo-Kachari groups.

The first reference of Bihu can be found in the copperplate inscription of the Chutia king Lakshminarayan. The inscription was found in Ghilamara region of Lakhimpur district in the year 1935 and it was issued in the year 1401 A.D. It states that the king Lakshminarayan has donated land grants to Brahmins on the auspicious occasion of Bihu. It reads,“Etasmay Shashana prada Lakshminarayana NripaUtrijya Bisuye Punya Ravidev Dvijanme”
This means that on the pious occasion of Bihu, a Brahmin named Dvija Ravidev was granted land by the king. This indicates that Bihu played an important role in the social life of people of Assam at that period.
Yet another reference of Bihu can be found in the Deodhai Buranji which mentions that the capital of the Chutia kingdom, Sadiya was suddenly attacked by the Ahom forces on the first day of Bihu/Bisu in 1524 (first Wednesday of Bohag/Vaisakha), when the people were busy celebrating Bihu. The Ahom general Phrasenmung Borgohain upon the advice of a Chutia general (who sided with the enemies) played the Bihu Dhul (on Ujha Bisu day i.e. 7th Bohag/Vaisakha) to trick the Chutias which ultimately led to their defeat.

In early texts, Bohag Bihu celebrations started from the first week of Chot in Assamese month. The period from the first week of Chaitra till the end was known as Raati Bihu or Chotor Bihu. During this period, young people danced at night in the grounds of the Than (temple). The last day of Chaitra or the first Tuesday of Bohag was when the Rati Bihu ended. This was known as the Uruka (derived from the Deori-Chutia Urukuwa meaning to end). The temple dancers Deodhani danced the entire night and were believed to be possessed by the goddess Kechai-khati (kolimoti), signaling that she had descended upon earth from heaven (Bihu nomai ona). This belief of the goddess arriving during the Bihu season each year can still be found in Bihu songs as,""Kolimoti e bai ghuri BohagoloiAhibi ne nai?Ami thakim ami thakimBaatoloi sai."" The day after Uruka, i.e. the first Wednesday was celebrated as Goru Bihu. This tradition of cattle rites is same as that followed by the Boros in Bwisagu indicating the common roots of both the festivals. During the night of Goru-bihu, people danced Bihu in separate groups in the Thans where animal sacrifice took place. After the sacrifices to the goddess, the young folk visited the households of the village, which was the start of Husori. This old tradition of starting Husori from the temple is still followed by the Deoris, some Sonowals, Chutias and Morans as well as the people of Sadiya. In other communities, the temple has been replaced by the Namghar. The festivities of Bohag Bihu continued for a week and ended with the rite by which the goddess was bid farewell. In this rite, a boat was first prepared out of banana stem and decorated with flowers and offerings. Then, it was carried to the banks of the river where a duck/chicken was put inside the boat and allowed to float as a symbol of sacrifice. After performing the rite, the people returned to their homes, singing along the way with the beats of the Dhul and the tunes of the Pepa.
Some old Assamese Bihu folklore still hint to this tradition.

“Hasoti e chot Bisoti e chot.Budhe Goru Bihu Mangale Uruka.Bihu goi asili kot.”“Boge dhari khale luitor hihu,Mangal bare Uruka Budh bare Goru Bihu Tar pasor dina Manisor Bihu.”“Husori e chot asili kot.Sadiyar ahotor tolot,Husori e chot asili kot.Ami je ulomu jot Dubori nogoje tot.”“Kundilor agolit ukhokoi Himolu.Tate loi kuruwai bah.Sadiyar rajate sari haal goxani Taloi namaskar koru.Hunare jakhala Rupor hetamari Ahe sari haali nami.”
The modern form of Bihu dance was derived from the Faat Bihu dance celebrated in Dhakuakhana, Lakhimpur. The performers were called by the Ahom king Rudra Singha in 1694 to dance in the royal arena Rang Ghar. The origin of Faat Bihu can be traced to Sadiya. The word Faat in Deori-Chutia language means ""to migrate"". After the defeat of the Sadiyal Kacharis in Sadiya, the survivors were displaced from Sadiya to different places in the kingdom. A group of these people moved from Sadiya, to Dibrugarh and finally settled down in Harhi Sapori, Dhakuakhana. These people had brought the idols of god and goddess along with them and established a temple now known as Harhi Dewaloi. It was here that the first form of modern Bihu dance was developed. Later, in the 19th century, this form of Bihu dance was adopted by the other communities as well and started being performed in Mahguli sapori, Dhakuakhana by Chutias, Sonowals, Deoris, Ahoms, Mishing etc.

Ahom contribution
Ahoms used to celebrate their own spring festival Chyeng-Ken; the rituals of Chyeng-Ken are described in Khyek-Lai-Bet manuscript. But later on they adopted Bihu as their spring festival. Ahom King Rudra Singha gave patronage to Bihu and was also the first one to celebrate Bihu in the courtyard of Rang Ghar. This policy was later followed by his successors.

Indo-Aryan contribution
The Indo-Aryans upon their arrival in Assam helped in gradually sanskritisation of the native Bihu/Bisu to bring it to the present form. Being the pioneers of Astronomy, they further associated the term Bisu with the Visuvan day for coincidence of the Bohag Bihu with other springtime festivals observed elsewhere in India on this day and adopted the festival of the natives.

The three Bihu Festivals
Bohag Bihu
Bohag Bihu (mid-April, also called Rongali Bihu), the most popular Bihu celebrates the onset of the Assamese New Year (around 14–15 April) and the coming of Spring. This marks the first day of the Hindu solar calendar and is also observed in Bengal, Manipur, Mithila, Nepal, Orissa, Punjab, Kerala and Tamil Nadu though called by different names. It's a time of merriment and feasting and continues, in general, for seven days. The farmers prepare the fields for cultivation of paddy and there is a feeling of joy around. The women make pitha, laroos (traditional food made of rice, coconut) various drinks by local tribes such as Chuje by Deoris, Nam-Lao by Tai-Ahom, Aapong by Mising tribe and Jolpan which gives the real essence of the season.

The first day of the bihu is called goru bihu or cow bihu, where the cows are washed and worshipped, which falls on the last day of the previous year, usually on 14 April. This is followed by manuh (human) bihu on 15 April, the New Year Day. This is the day of getting cleaned up, wearing new cloths and celebrating and getting ready for the new year with fresh vigor. The third day is Gosai (Gods) bihu; statues of Gods, worshiped in all households are cleaned and worshiped asking for a smooth new year.

The folk songs associated with the Bohag Bihu are called Bihugeets or Bihu songs. The form of celebration and rites vary among different demographic groups.

The Seven days
Bohag Bihu or Rongali Bihu festival continues for seven days and called as Haat Bihu. The seven days are known as Chot Bihu, Goru Bihu, Manuh Bihu, Kutum Bihu, Senehi Bihu, Mela Bihu and Chera Bihu.

Goru Bihu: The goru bihu or cattle worship rites are observed on the last day of the year.  The cattle are washed, smeared with ground turmeric and other pastes, struck with sprigs of dighalati and makhiyati and endeared to be healthy and productive (lao kha, bengena kha, bosore bosore barhi ja / maar xoru, baper xoru, toi hobi bor bor goru—eat gourd, eat brinjal, grow from year to year / your mother is small, your father is small, but you be a large one).  The old cattle ropes are cast away through the legs and new ropes are tied to them, and they are allowed to roam anywhere they wished for the entire day.

Manuh Bihu: The New Year Day, the day after the goru bihu, is called the manuh bihu.  Elders are shown respect, with gifts of bihuwan (a gamosa), a hachoti (kerchief), a cheleng etc., and their blessings are sought.  Children are given new clothes, and Husori singing begins on this day, and people visit their relatives and friends.
Husori: Village elders move from household to households singing carols, also in the style of bihu geets, called husoris. 

 It possibly derives from the Dimasa Kachari word formation ha (land) and char (move over): hachari.  Villages could have more than one Husori band, and they would visit households in a village non-contiguous to itself, first singing carols at the Naamghar.  The husari singers then visit individual households, by first announcing their arrival at the gate (podulimukh) with drum beats.  The singers are traditionally welcomed into the courtyard where they sing the husori songs and perform a ring dance.  At the end of the performance they are thanked with an offering dakshina of paan (betel leaf) tamul (areka nut) in a xorai (brass dish with stand), whereupon the singers bless the household for the coming year.  If there is a bereavement in the family, or the family does not invite the husori singers due to an illness, the husori band offers blessings from podulimukh and move on. Generally the singers are all male.
Faat Bihu: This is a very old form of Bihu, characterized by spontaneity, popular in the Lakhimpur area of Assam.
Mukoli Bihu: Young unmarried men and women attired in traditional golden silk muga dance the bihu and sing bihu songs in the open fields.  The songs have themes of romance and sexual love, requited or unrequited.  Sometimes the songs describe tragic events too but treated very lightly.  The dance celebrates female sexuality.

Jeng Bihu: This is Bihu dance and song performed and watched only by women. The name ""jeng"" comes from the fact that in earlier days women in the villages used to surround the place of their performance with sticks dug into the ground called jeng in Assamese. It is also called gos tolor bihu (Bihu beneath the tree).
Baisago: The Bodo-Kachari people celebrate for seven days—the first day for cattle (Magou), the second day for man (Mansoi) and ancestor worship, feasting, singing and merriment.  Songs follow the same themes as the Bihu songs.

Bihutoli Bihu: The rural festival made its transition to urban life when it was first time brought to the stage in Lataxil field in Guwahati by the Guwahati Bihu Sanmilani in 1962, promoted by leading citizens like Radha Govinda Baruah and others.  Bihu to a great extent has been popularized by the Bihu 'Samrat'( king ), of Assam, Khagen Mahanta. Unlike the rural version, the dancers danced on a makeshift elevated stage in an open area that came to be known as a Bihutoli.  Many such Bihutolis have sprouted since then in Guwahati and other urban areas. The performances are not confined to the Bihu dance form but may incorporate all forms of theatrical performances to keep the audience enthralled well into the early hours.  Performances could include standup comedy, to concerts by solo singers.  The stage form of Bihu has become so popular, that organizers have begun extending the celebrations to bohagi bidai, or farewell to the Bohag month, which is similar performances held a month later.
Saat Bihu: Rongali Bihu also called saat Bihu (seven Bihus). It celebrates seven days, it's called so. On the other hand, Rangali Bihu is constitute of seven different types of Bihu -Goru Bihu (Cow Bihu), Manuh Bihu, Xat Bihu, Senehi Bihu, Maiki Bihu, Rongali Bihu, and Sera Bihu. Actually, the first day to pay respect to cows and other days for social activities.

Kati Bihu
Kongali Bihu (mid-October, also called Kati-Bihu) has a different flavor as there is less merriment and the atmosphere has a sense of constraining and solemnity. During this time of the year, the paddy in the fields are in the growing stage and the granaries of the farmers are almost empty. On this day, earthen lamps (saki) are lit at the foot of the household tulsi plant, the granary, the garden (bari) and the paddy fields. In ancient times, earthen lamps were lit all around the paddy fields to attract the insects, thus acting as a natural insecticide. To protect the maturing paddy, cultivators whirl a piece of bamboo and recite rowa-khowa chants and spells to ward off pests and the evil eye. During the evening, cattle are fed specially made rice items called pitha. Kati Bihu is known as Kati Gasa by the Bodo people and Gathi Sainjora by the Dimasa people. The Bodo people light lamps at the foot of the siju (Euphorbia neriifolia) tree.  This Bihu is also associated with the lighting of akaxi gonga or akaxbonti, lamps at the tip of a tall bamboo pole, to show the souls of the dead the way to heaven, a practice that is common to many communities in India, as well as Asia and Europe. Kati bihu is generally celebrated around 19 October, as it is almost mid-October.

Magh Bihu
Bhogali Bihu (mid-January, also called Magh Bihu) comes from the word Bhog that is eating and enjoyment. It is a harvest festival and marks the end of harvesting season. Since the granaries are full, there is a lot of feasting and eating during this period. On the eve of the day called uruka, i.e., the last day of pausa, menfolk, more particularly young men go to the field, preferably near a river, build a makeshift cottage called Bhelaghar with the hay of the harvest fields and the bonfire or Meji, . the most important thing for the night. During the night, they prepare food and there is community feasting everywhere. There is also the exchange of sweets and greetings at this time. The entire night (called Uruka) is spent around a Meji  with people singing bihu songs, beating Dhol, a typical kind of drums or playing games. Boys roam about in the dark stealing firewood and vegetables for fun. The next morning they take a bath and burn the main Meji. People gather around the Meji and throw Pithas (rice cakes) and betel nuts to it while burning it at the same time. They offer their prayers to the god of Fire and mark the end of the harvesting year. Thereafter they come back home carrying pieces of half burnt firewood for being thrown among fruit trees for favorable results. All the trees in the compound are tied to bamboo strips or paddy stems. Different types of sports like Buffalo-fight, Egg-fight, Cock-fight, Nightingale-fight etc. are held throughout the day. There are other conventional festivals observed by various ethnic-cultural groups. Me-dam-me-phi, Ali-aye-ligang, Porag, Garja, Hapsa Hatarnai, Kherai are few among them. The koch celebrates this bihu as pushna.

Instruments used in Bihu
Dhol (Drum)
Taal
Pepa (An instrument made of buffalo horn)
Toka
Baanhi (Flute)
Xutuli
Gogona (An instrument made of Bambo)

The festival is of mostly aboriginal origin comprising Tibeto-Burman and Tai elements. It usually falls in the 2nd week of April, historically signifying the time of harvest. Every year it falls on the 14th day of April. The holiday unites the different native communities of Assam regardless of their  backgrounds and promotes the celebration of ethnic diversity.
Rongali Utsav is a festival organised in Guwahati every year. The festival showcases tribal culture of Assam to the world.
In Assam locally the onset of 'Bohag' (Assamese Calendar) marks the starting of Rongali Bihu. The three primary types of Bihu are Bohag Bihu or Rongali Bihu, Kati Bihu or Kongali Bihu, and Magh Bihu or Bhogali Bihu. Each festival historically recognizes a different agricultural cycle of the paddy crops.  During  Rongali Bihu there are 7 pinnacle phases:  'Sot', 'Raati', 'Goru', 'Manuh', 'Kutum', 'Mela' and 'Sera'.

Raati Bihu: This phase begins on the first night of the month of Sot and lasts till Uruka. This phase was usually performed beneath an ancient tree or in an open field illuminated by burning torches. It was celebrated in the villages and was meant as a gathering for the local women. The participation of men was mostly ceremonial where they played a pepa i.e. a buffalo hornpipe. Another notable musical instrument played in this phase was the bholuka baanhor toka which is a split bamboo musical instrument.
Sot Bihu: Also called Bali Husori, this phase begins on the second day of the month of Sot Mah. On this day Bihu songs and dances are organized by the young at outdoor locations, fields or a naamghor bakori (yard of community prayer hall) till the occurrence of Uruka, the formal beginning of Rongali Bihu.
Goru Bihu: This phase is related to the agricultural roots of Assam and the reverence of livestock which provided an ancient method of livelihood. On the last date of Sot month ie. the first day of Rongali Bihu is dedicated to the caring upkeep of livestock and a cattle show. Typically the collective cattle of a village are brought to a water source like a pond or a river.  The cattle are washed with a combination of symbolic herbs :  maah-halodhi (black gram and turmeric paste), whipped  dighloti (litsea salicifolia, a plant with long leaf), makhioti (flemingia strobilifera,  tonglati (a plant with flower like soft plastic butter-fly) and pieces of lau (bottle gourd) and bengena (brinjal).  People sing the following passage: ""Dighloti dighal paat, maakhi marru jaat jaat; lau khaa bengena khaa, bosore bosore bardhi jaa, maare xaru baapere xoru toi hobi bor bor goru"" . This is roughly translated as  : ""With our herbs and the leaves of dighloti, we drive away the flies which disturb you; we hope you accept our offering of brinjals and gourds, and continue to grow every year; and may you outgrow your parents"". After washing the cattle, the remaining branches of dighloti-makhioti and lau-bengena chat etc. are hung on the roof of the cattle ranch signifying their participation. Games are organised which include collecting exho ebidh haak (101 types of vegetables), with variations of activities which may include specifics like gathering amlori tup (larvae of weaver ant, Oecophylla smaragdina), binding betel leaf plants,  planting some bamboo roots, and many other symbolic harvest related ritual materials.  There is also an occasional food fight, also known as Kori Khel, Paakha Khel and koni-juj. At Dusk, the cattle are paraded back to their ranches. The cattle are decorated with new harnesses, and are fed pitha (the typical Assamese confectionery). The day's end is marked by burning rice bran to create smoke.

Manuh Bihu: The first day of the Bohag month marks Manuh Bihu ('Manuh' symbolises ""Elders"" and Ancestral Spirits). People give offerings to the elders and the ancestral spirits and ask for blessings. People have a special maah halodhi bath, put on new clothes and light saki at Gohai Ghor (the household prayer place). ""Manuh Bihu"" involves the tradition of seeking blessings from the elders in a family and presenting the ceremonial patch of Bihuwan or the Gamusa cloth, as a gift, to be worn as a symbol of  cultural pride. A 'Gamusa' is an indispensable part of indigenous Assamese life and culture with its distinctive symbolic significance. The intricacy of its handcrafting symbolically historically heralded of the ideas of friendship, love, regards, warmth, hospitality and it is intimately woven into the social fabric of Assam.
Kutum Bihu: The second date of Bohag Mah is Kutum Bihu (""Kutum"" symbolises ""Kin""). On this day people visit their families, relatives and friends and have lunch or dinner together and share news and stories.
Mela Bihu: The third day of Bihu is marked by the celebration of Bihu with cultural events and competitions in outdoor locales (Mela symbolises ""Fair""). In the ancient days, the King and his staff used to come out to such fairs or bihutolis to mingle in the Bihu celebrations. This tradition of events is continued till date with Bihu Melas or Bihu functions. The fairs are attended by people from all over Assam and are aimed at fostering an atmosphere of the communal brotherhood and the inclusion of everyone.
Sera Bihu: Also called Bohagi Bidai, Phato Bihu it is the fourth and final day of Rongali Bihu. In different regions of Assam, people celebrate it differently but the common theme is wrapping up the celebrations with contemplation and future resolutions. It is marked by the exchange of Pithas made by different families during the Bihu week among their friends and relatives.

This event is celebrated by Sonowal Kacharis every two years in Dibrugarh, Lakhimpur (Bihpuria), Assam.

Origination
The Bohua dance has ancient origins. It is known that Lord Shiva or Khring Raja Baithow is the main God of the Sonowal Kacharis. It is mentioned in the Bhagavad and other Puranic texts that Daksha, the son of Lord Brahma, was the king of Tribhuvan. Daksha's youngest daughter Sati, who Daksha was very fond of, fell in love with Lord Shiva when she was a teenager. However, King Daksha didn't want to give his dear daughter's hand to Lord Shiva, who had no wealth, was always nude, and whose companions were ghosts and demons. Lord Brahma intervened and ordered Daksha to marry his daughter to Lord Shiva and Daksha obeyed. One day Shiva went to visit Daksha along with other guests. When Daksha came to see them everyone except Shiva greeted him! Angered by his dishonor, Daksha promised to take revenge upon Shiva himself. One day Daksha decided to organize a Mahayajna only to take revenge upon Shiva. He invited Yamraj, all the demigods and even the kings and queens. Everyone except lord Shiva was invited. When Shiva and Sati learned of this, she desired to visit her father's Mahayajna. After much reluctance Shiva let her go. But when she reached her father's house, Dakshya ridiculed her in front of everyone. Unable to bear this ridicule from her father, Sati left her body on the Mahajagya. When this news reached Kailash, ghosts and demons appeared on the yajna to vandalize it. When Lord Shiva arrived, a drop of sweat from his forehead fell on the ground and a warrior named Birbharda was created. This fearless warrior with the order of Shiva beheaded Dakshya! After this incident, the wife of King Dakshya came crying to Shiva and begged him to restore her husband's life. The powerful Lord Shiva then put the head of a sacrificed goat in Dakshya's body and lo! He was alive again! After his resurrection, the king and his queen danced in joy. Everyone praised the mighty Lord Shiva for his divine powers. The Sonowal Kacharis therefore performed the Bohua dance in praise of Lord Shiva. This dance signifies the beginning of a new life, a clean society, and the riddance of bad omen. In this way the Bohua dance has been performed for many generations.

Etymology and references in literature
Hindu literature is replete with references of terms like Dolotsava and Dola Yatra. Garga Samhita, a Vaishnav text has reference to Dolotsava of Shri Krishna in the month of Chaitra.
The Sanskrit word Dola means a swing, while utsava means a festival or a feast. Hence, Dolotsava literally means swing festival or swing feast and refers to religious service of swinging the idol of a deity on a swing.
Similarly, word Dola Yatra is compound of two Sanskrit words: Dola and yatra . Yatra refers to procession and thus Dola yatra refers to swing procession.

Over the years, Durga Puja has morphed into an inseparable part of Indian culture with a diverse group of people celebrating this festival in their unique way while on tradition.

Names
In West Bengal, Odisha, Assam, Jharkhand and Tripura, Durga Puja is also called Akalbodhan (literally, ""untimely awakening of Durga""), Sharadiya pujo or puja (""autumnal worship""), Sharodotsab (""festival of autumn""), Maha pujo (""grand puja""), Maayer pujo (""worship of the Mother""), Durga pujo, or merely Puja(In Odisha, Bihar) or Pujo. In Bangladesh, Durga Puja has historically been celebrated as Bhagabati puja. Maa Durga is known as the Goddess of Power (feminine) which represents triumph of Goodness over evil.
Durga Puja is also referred to by the names of related Shakta Hindu festivals such as Navaratri, celebrated on the same days elsewhere in India; such as in Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Kerala, and Maharashtra, Kullu Dussehra, celebrated in Kullu Valley, Himachal Pradesh; Mysore Dussehra celebrated in Mysore, Karnataka; Bommai Golu, celebrated in Tamil Nadu; Bommala Koluvu, celebrated in Andhra Pradesh; and Bathukamma, celebrated in Telangana.

History and origins
Durga is an ancient goddess of Hinduism according to available archeological and textual evidence. However, the origins of Durga Puja are unclear and undocumented.

The name Durga, and related terms, appear in Vedic literature, such as in the Rigveda hymns 4.28, 5.34, 8.27, 8.47, 8.93 and 10.127, and in sections 10.1 and 12.4 of the Atharvaveda A deity named Durgi appears in section 10.1.7 of the Taittiriya Aranyaka. While the Vedic literature uses the word Durga, the description therein lacks legendary details about her or about Durga Puja that is found in later Hindu literature.
A key text associated with Durga Puja is Devi Mahatmya, which is recited during the festival. Durga was likely well established by the time this Hindu text was composed, the date of which scholars estimate as between 400 and 600 CE. The Devi Mahatmya scripture describes the nature of evil forces symbolised by Mahishasura as shape-shifting, deceptive, and adapting in nature, in form and in strategy to create difficulties and thus achieve their evil ends. Durga calmly understands and counters the evil in order to achieve her solemn goals.Durga, in her various forms, appears as an independent deity in the Indian texts.
In the Mahabharata, both Yudhisthira and Arjuna invoke hymns to Durga. She appears in Harivamsa in the form of Vishnu's eulogy and in Pradyumna's prayer. The prominent mention of Durga in such epics may have led to her worship.

Some versions of the Puranas mention Durga Puja to be a spring festival, while the Devi-Bhagavata Purana and two other Shakta Puranas mentions it to be an autumn festival. The Ramayana manuscripts are also inconsistent. Versions of Ramayana found in the north, west, and south of the Indian subcontinent describe Rama to be remembering Surya (the Hindu sun god) before his battle against Ravana, but the Bengali manuscripts of Ramayana, such as the Krittivasi Ramayana, a 15th-century manuscript by Krttivasa, mention Rama to be worshipping Durga. As per the legend, Rama worshipped Durga in the autumn to have her blessings before defeating Ravana. While he was preparing for the worship of the goddess, Durga hid one of the 108 flowers of lotus, very essential for her worship. Having found only 107 of 108 lotuses at the time of the worship, Rama decided to offer one of his eyes in place of that lotus. When he was about to offer his eye, Durga appeared and told him that she had only hidden the flower in order to test his devotion and she was satisfied with it. She blessed Rama and he continued with her worship. Since the gods are believed to be sleeping during autumn, the awakening rite of the Durga puja is also known as akāla bodhana.
Surviving manuscripts from the 14th-century provide guidelines for Durga Puja, while historical records suggest the royalty and wealthy families to be sponsoring major Durga Puja public festivities, since at least the 16th-century. The 11th or 12th-century Jain text Yasatilaka by Somadeva mentions an annual festival dedicated to a warrior goddess, celebrated by the king and his armed forces, and the description mirrors attributes of Durga Puja.
According to some scholars, the worship of the fierce warrior goddess Durga, and her darker and more violent manifestation Kali, became popular in the Bengal region during and after the medieval era, marked by Muslim invasions and conquests.
The significance of Durga and other goddesses in Hindu culture is stated to have increased after Islamic armies conquered regions of the Indian subcontinent. According to yet other scholars, the marginalization of Bengali Hindus during the medieval era led to a reassertion of Hindu identity and an emphasis on Durga Puja as a social festival, publicly celebrating the warrior goddess.From the medieval era up to present-day, Durga Puja has been celebrated as a socio-cultural event, while maintaining the roots of religious worship.

Rituals and practices
Texts
The puja rituals involve mantras (words manifesting spiritual transformation), shlokas (holy verses), chants and arati, and offerings. The worship begins with a reading of the Sanskrit Devī Mahātmya from the sixth-century Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa. The shlokas and mantras praise the divinity of the goddess; according to the shlokas, Durga is omnipresent as the embodiment of power, nourishment, memory, forbearance, faith, forgiveness, intellect, wealth, emotions, desires, beauty, satisfaction, righteousness, fulfillment and peace.

Relation to harvest
Durga Puja is, in part, a post-monsoon harvest festival observed on the same days in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism as those in its other traditions. The practice of including a bundle of nine different plants, called navapatrika, as a symbolism of Durga, is a testament practice to its agricultural importance. The typically selected plants include not only representative important crops, but also non-crops. This probably signifies the Hindu belief that the goddess is ""not merely the power inherent in the growth of crops but the power inherent in all vegetation"".
The festival is a social and public event in the eastern and northeastern states of India, where it dominates religious and socio-cultural life, with temporary pandals built at community squares, roadside shrines, and temples. The festival is also observed by some Shakta Hindus as a private home-based festival.
Before Durga puja there is Paata Puja, the ritual of making an idol on the day of the Rath Yatra, usually around July. 'Paata' is the wooden frame that forms the base for the idols.

Day One
Durga Puja is a ten-day event. The festival begins with Mahalaya, a day on which Hindus perform tarpaṇa by offering water and food to their dead ancestors. The day also marks the arrival of Durga from her marital home in Kailash.
The festival starts at twilight with prayers to Saraswati. She is believed to be another aspect of goddess Durga. This is also the day when the eyes are painted of the deities on the representative clay sculpture-idols, bringing them to a lifelike appearance. The day also marks prayers to Ganesha and visit to pandals and temples.

Day Two to Five
Day two to five mark the remembrance of the goddess and her manifestations, such as Kumari (goddess of fertility), Mai (mother), Ajima (grandmother), Lakshmi (goddess of wealth) and in some regions as the Saptamatrikas (seven mothers) or Navadurga (nine aspects of Durga). On the sixth day major festivities and social celebrations start. The first nine days overlap with Navaratri festivities in other traditions of Hinduism.The specific practices vary by region.

Day Six to Nine
The next significant day of the festival is the sixth day (Shashthi), on which devotees welcomes the goddess and festive celebrations are inaugurated. Rituals typically performed on the sixth day include:
Bodhana: Involves rites to awaken and welcome the goddess to be a guest. The amorphous sight of the goddess is consecrated into a ghata or noggin while the visible sight is consecrated into the murti or idol. These rituals are known as ghatasthapana and  pranapratistha respectively.
Adhivasa: Anointing ritual wherein symbolic offerings are made to Durga, with each item representing a remembrance of subtle forms of her.
On the seventh day (Saptami), eighth (Ashtami) and ninth (Navami) days, the goddess along with Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha, and Kartikeya are revered and these days mark the main days of worship with recitation of scriptures, puja, legends of Durga in Devi Mahatmya, social visits to elaborately decorated and illuminated pandals (temporary structures meant for hosting the puja), among others.

Navapatrika snan: Bathing of the navapatrika with holy water done on the seventh day of the festival.
Sandhi puja and Ashtami pushpanjali: The eighth day begins with elaborate pushpanjali rituals. The cusp of the ending of the eighth day and beginning of the ninth day is considered to be the moment when per scriptures Durga engaged in a fierce battle against Mahishasura and was attacked by the demons Chanda and Munda. Goddess Chamunda emerged from the third eye of Durga and killed Chanda and Munda at the cusp of Ashtami and Navami, the eighth and ninth days respectively. This moment is marked by the sandhi puja, involving the offering of 108 lotuses and lighting of 108 lamps. It is a forty-eight minutes long ritual commemorating the climax of battle. The rituals are performed in the last 24 minutes of Ashtami and the first 24 minutes of Navami. In some regions, devotees sacrifice an animal such as a buffalo or goat, but in many regions, there is not an actual animal sacrifice and a symbolic sacrifice substitutes it. The surrogate effigy is smeared in red vermilion to symbolize the blood spilled. The goddess is then offered food (bhog). Some places also engage in devotional service.

Homa and bhog: The ninth day of festival is marked with the homa (fire oblation) rituals and bhog. Some places also perform kumari puja on this day.

Day Ten
Sindoor khela and immersion: The tenth and last day, called Vijaya Dashami is marked by sindoor khela, where women smear sindoor or vermillion on the sculpture-idols and also smear each other with it. This ritual signifies the wishing of a blissful marital life for married women. Historically the ritual has been restricted to married women. The tenth day is the day when Durga emerged victorious against Mahishasura and it ends with a procession where the clay sculpture-idols are ceremoniously taken to a river or coast for immersion rites. Following the immersion, Durga is believed to return to her mythological marital home of Kailasa to Shiva and the cosmos in general. People distribute sweets and gifts, visit their friends and family members on the tenth day. Some communities such as those near Varanasi mark the day after Vijaya Dashami, called Ekadashi, by visiting a Durga temple.

Dhunuchi naach and dhuno pora: Dhunuchi naach involves a dance ritual performed with dhunuchi (incense burner). Drummers called dhakis, carrying large leather-strung Dhaks, Dhols and other traditional drums depending on the region, to create music, to which people dance either during or not during aarati. Some places, especially home pujas, also observe dhuno pora, a ritual involving married women carrying dhunuchis burning with incense and dried coconuts, on a cloth on their head and hands,

Decorations, sculptures, and stages
The process of the creation of clay sculpture-idols (pratima or murti) for the puja, from the collection of clay to the ornamentation is a ceremonial process. Though the festival is observed post-monsoon harvest, the artisans begin making the sculpture-idols months before, during summer. The process begins with prayers to Ganesha and to the perceived divinity in materials such as bamboo frames in which the sculpture-idols are cast.

Clay, or alluvial soil, collected from different regions form the base. This choice is a tradition wherein Durga, perceived as the creative energy and material, is believed to be present everywhere and in everything in the universe. In certain traditions in Kolkata, a custom is to include soil samples in the clay mixture for Durga from areas believed to be nishiddho pallis (forbidden territories; territories inhabited by the ""social outcasts"" such as brothels).
The clay base is combined with straw, kneaded, and then molded into a cast made from hay and bamboo. This is layered to a fine final shape, cleaned, painted, and polished. A layer of a fiber called jute, mixed in with clay, is also attached to the top to prevent the statue from cracking in the months ahead. The heads of the statues are more complex and are usually made separately. The limbs of the statues are mostly shaped from bundles of straws. Then, starting about August, the local artisans hand-paint the sculpture-idols which are later dressed in clothing, are decorated and bejewelled, and displayed at the puja altars.
The procedure for and proportions of the sculpture-idols are described in arts-related Sanskrit texts of Hinduism, such as the Vishvakarma Sashtra.

Environmental impact
The sculpture-idols for the puja are traditionally made of biodegradable materials such as straw, clay, soil, and wood. In today's times, brighter colored statues have increased in popularity and have diversified the use of non-biodegradable, cheaper or more colorful substitute synthetic raw materials. Environmental activists have raised concerns about the paint used to produce the statue, stating that the heavy metals in these paints pollute rivers when the statues are immersed at the end of the Durga festival.
Brighter colors that are also biodegradable and eco-friendly, as well as the traditional natural colors, are typically more expensive compared to the non biodegradable paints. The Indian state of West Bengal has banned the use of hazardous paints, and various state government have started distributing lead-free paints to artisans at no cost to prevent pollution.

Animal sacrifice, symbolic sacrifice
Shakta Hindu communities mark the slaying of Mahishasura and the victory of Durga with a symbolic or actual sacrifice. Most communities prefer symbolic sacrifice, where a statue of the asura is made of flour or equivalent, is immolated and smeared with vermilion, symbolic of the blood that had spilled during the battle. Other substitutes include a vegetable or a sweet dish considered equivalent to the animal. In certain instances, devotees consider animal sacrifice distasteful, and practice alternate means of expressing devotion while respecting the views of others in their tradition.
In communities performing actual sacrifice, an animal is sacrificed, mainly at temples. In Nepal, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam, animal sacrifices are performed at Shakta temples to commemorate the legend of Durga slaying Mahishasura. This involves slaying of a fowl, pig, goat, or male water-buffalo. Large scale animal sacrifices are rare among Hindus outside the regions of Bengal, Odisha, Assam, and Nepal. In these regions, festivals are primarily when significant animal sacrifices are  observed.
The Rajputs of Rajasthan worship their weapons and horses in the related festival of Navaratri, and some historically observed the sacrifice of a goat, a practice that continues in some places. The sacrifice ritual, supervised he the priest, requires slaying of the animal with a single stroke. In the past this ritual was considered a rite of passage into manhood and readiness as a warrior. The Kuldevi (clan deity) among these Rajput communities is a warrior goddess, with local legends tracing reverence for her during Rajput-Muslim wars.

Pandals and theme-based pujas
Months before the start of Durga Puja, youth members of the community collect funds and donations, engage priests and artisans, buy votive materials and help build pandals centered around a theme, which has rose to prominence in recent years. Such themes have included sex work, celebration of humanity, marginalization of queer persons and transgender persons, folk culture, celebration of cinema, womanhood,  pro-environment themes, while others have chosen metaphorical themes such as celebration of maati (literally, soil or ash) and ""finding one's own light"". Pandals have also been replicated on existing temples, structures, and monuments and yet others have been made of elements such as metal scraps, nails, and turmeric among others. Durga Puja pandals have also been centered around themes to acknowledge political events such as the 2019 Balakot airstrike and to protest against the National Register of Citizens of India.
The budget required for such theme-based pujas is significantly higher than traditional pujas. For such theme-based pujas, the preparations and the building of pandals are a significant arts-related economic activity, often attracting major sponsors. Such commercialized pujas attract crowds of visitors. The growth of competitiveness in theme-based pandals has escalated costs and scale of Durga Puja in eastern states of India. Some segments of the society criticize the billboards, the economic competition, and seek return to basics. The competition takes many forms, such as the height of statue. In 2015, an 88-foot statue of Durga in Kolkata's Deshapriya Park attracted numerous devotees, with some estimates placing visitors at one million.

Regional celebrations and observances
There exists variation in Durga Puja worship practices and rituals, as is the case with other Hindu festivals, in the Indian subcontinent. Hinduism accepts flexibility and leaves the set of practices to the choice of the individuals concerned. Different localized rituals may be observed regionally, with these variations accepted across temples, pandals, and within families.
The festival is most commonly associated with Bengali Hindus, and with the community having variability and differences in practices. There may exist differences of practice between the puja of theme-based Pandals, family pujas (with puja of erstwhile aristocrat families known as bonedi puja), and community pujas (known as barowari pujas) of neighbourhoods or apartments.
The rituals of the puja also varies from being Vedic, Puranic, or Tantric, or a combination of these. The Bengali Durga Puja rituals typically combine all three. The non-Bengali Durga Puja rituals tend to be essentially Vedic (srauta) in nature but they too incorporate esoteric elements making the puja an example of a culmination of Vedic-Tantric practices.
Historical evidence suggests that the Durga Puja has evolved over time, becoming more elaborate, social, and creative. The festival had earlier been a domestic puja, a form of practice that still remains popular. But it had also come to be celebrated in the sarvajanin (public) form, where communities get together, pool their resources and efforts to set up pandals and illuminations, and celebrate the event as a ""mega-show to share"". The origins of this variation are unclear, with some sources suggesting a family in Kolkata reviving such celebration in 1411 CE. While other set of sources suggest that a Bengali landlord, named Kamsanarayan, held a mega-show puja in late 16th-century Bengal. Yet, this festival of Bengal is likely much older with the discovery of 11th and 12th-century Durga Puja manual manuscripts such as Durgotsavaviveka, Durgotsava Prayoga, Vasantaviveka and Kalaviveka. The rituals associated with the Durga Puja migrated to other regions from Bengal, such as in Varanasi, a city that has historically attracted sponsorship from Hindus from various parts of the Indian subcontinent including Bengal. In contemporary India, Durga Puja is celebrated in various styles and forms.
In Kolkata, Durga Puja is an annual festival celebrated magnificently. Kolkata alone hosted more than 3,000 Barowari pujas in Kolkata in 2022, with more than 200 pujas were organized in the city with a budget of over one crore rupees. Kolkata has been inscribed on the list of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists in December 2021.
In Bishnupur, West Bengal, Durga Puja holds a unique and significant place. The district boasts the Rajbari Durga Puja, also known as the Mrinmoyee Maa er pujo, which dates back to 994 AD. This makes it the oldest Durga Puja in the entire Bengal region, encompassing present-day Bangladesh, Odisha, and Tripura.
In Basirhat, West Bengal, the scale and intensity of durga puja celebration is among the biggest in North 24 Parganas district with more than 100 installations in the city. For more than 150 years, the Durga idol has been immersed on boats in this city. On the day of Vijayadashami, people usually come in Basirhat to see the immersion festival. The idols and installations have changed in the modern era, but the immersion continues to be done in the Ichamati River by boat according to the ancient tradition. A fair is held on both banks of the river centering on the immersion. The special attraction of this fair is wooden furniture and various wooden items.

Durga Puja is a widely celebrated festival in the Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh (eastern parts), Assam, and Odisha. It is celebrated over a five-day period. Streets are decked up with festive lights, loudspeakers play festive songs as well as recitation of hymns and chants by priests, and pandals are erected by communities. The roads become overcrowded with revellers, devotees, and pandal-hoppers visiting the pandals on puja days. It often creates chaotic traffic conditions. Shops, eateries, and restaurants stay open all night; fairs are also set up and cultural programmes are held. People form organizing committees, which plan and oversee the pandal during the festivities. Today, Durga Puja has turned into a consumerist social carnival, a major public spectacle and a major arts event riding on the wave of commercialisation, corporate sponsorship, and craze for award-winning. For private domestic pujas, families dedicate an area of their homes, known as thakur dalan, for Durga Puja where the sculpture-idols for worship is placed and decorated with home-dyed fabric, sola ornamentations, and gold and silver foil decorations. Elaborate rituals like arati are performed and prasad is distributed after being offered to the deities. As a tradition, married daughters visit their parents and celebrate the Durga Puja with them, a symbolism alluding to Durga who is popularly believed to return to her natal home during the puja.

Durga Puja is also a gift-giving and shopping season for communities celebrating it, with people buying gifts for not only family members but also for close relatives and friends. New clothes are the traditional gift, and people wear them to go out together during Durga Puja. During puja holidays, people may also go to places of tourist attractions while others return home to spend Durga Puja with their family. It's a common trend amongst youngsters and even those who are older to go pandal-hopping and enjoy the celebrations.
The organising committees of each puja pandal hires a purohita (priest) who performs the puja rituals on behalf of the community. For the priests, Durga Puja is a time of activity wherein he pursues the timely completion of Vedic-Puranic-Tantric ritual sequences to make various offerings and perform fire oblations, in full public view, while the socio-cultural festivities occur in parallel. The complex puja rituals include periods of accurate and melodic scripture recitation. The puja involves crowds of people visiting the pandals, with smaller groups visiting family pujas, to witness the celebrations. On the last day, the sculpture-idols are carried out in immersion processions across Bengal, following which they are ritually immersed into rivers or other waterbodies. The immersion ceremony continues till a couple of days after the last day of puja.

According to some scholars, the ritual of immersing the Durga sculpture-idol into the river attracted the attention of colonial era travelers to the Bengal region from Europe, such as Garcin de Tassy and Emma Roberts. In 1831, Tassy reported that similar rituals were annually observed by the Muslim community in Bengal. Shia Bengali Muslims observed Muharram over ten days, taking out processions in memory of the martyrdom of Imam Husayn ibn Ali, and then cast a memorial Imam's cenotaph into a river on the tenth day. Tassy further stated that the Bengali rituals of Muharram included the same offerings at the annual observation of Muharram that the Hindu rituals included during Durga Puja. According to yet other scholars, the ritual of immersion in water by Hindus for Durga Puja in Bengal and Ganesh Chaturthi in the western states of India, may have grown because members of the Hindu community attempted to create a competing procession and immersion ritual to that of Muharram, allowed by the colonial British Indian government in the 19th and early 20th-centuries.

In Maharashtra, the city of Nashik and other places such as CIDCO, Rajeevnagar, Panchavati, and Mahatmanagar host Durga Puja celebrations. While in Delhi, the first community Durga Puja was organized near Kashmiri Gate by a group of expatriate Bengalis, in 1910, a year before Delhi was declared the capital of British India. This group came to be the Delhi Durga Puja Samiti, popularly known as the Kashmere Gate Durga Puja. The Durga Puja at Timarpur, Delhi was started in the year 1914. In 2011, over 800 Durga Pujas were held in Delhi, with a few hundred more in Gurgaon and NOIDA.

In Odisha, Durga Puja is the most important festival of the people of the state. Durga Puja is a very important festival for Odias, during the 4 days of the festival, the streets of the city turns into a wonderland throughout the state, people welcome the arrival of their maa by rejoicing themselves, eating tasty food, wearing new clothes, seeing different pandals across the city, family gathering and gift givings. In 2019, ninety-seven pandals in Cuttack alone, Odisha were reported to bedeck respective sculpture-idols with silver jewelry for Durga Puja celebrations; such club of pandals termed regionally as Chandi Medha. The state capital is famous for the modern themes and creativity In the pandals, while the Western part of the state has a more retro decoration theme to the pandal. In the northern parts of the state particularly Balasore, Durga Puja is celebrated with much fervor and the Odia diaspora abroad especially in Australia, which originates 95% from the district of Balasore celebrates the puja in the same manner which is done back home in Balasore. In September 2019, 160 pandals were reported to be hosting Durga Puja in Cuttack.
While in Tripura there were over 2,500 community Durga Puja celebrations in 2013. Durga Puja has been started at the Durgabari temple, in Agartala by King Radha Kishore Manikya Bahadur.

Significance
Beyond being an art festival and a socio-religious event, Durga Puja has also been a political event with regional and national political parties having sponsored Durga Puja celebrations. In 2019, West Bengal Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee announced a grant of ₹25,000 to all community-organised Durga Pujas in the state.
In 2019, Kolkata's Durga Puja was nominated by the Indian government for the 2020 UNESCO Representative list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Durga Puja also stands to be politically and economically significant. The committees organising Durga Puja in Kolkata have close links to politicians. Politicians patronize the festival by making donations or helping raise money for funding of community pujas, or by marking their presence at puja events and inaugurations. The grant of ₹25,000 to puja organizing committees in West Bengal by a debt-ridden state government was reported to cost a budget a ₹70 crores. The state government also announced an additional grant of ₹5,000 to puja organizing committees fully managed by women alone, while also announcing a twenty-five percent concession on total electricity bills for puja pandal. The government had made a grant of ₹10,000 each to more than 20,000 puja organizing committees in the state in 2018.
A 2013 report by ASSOCHAM states West Bengal's Durga Puja to be a ₹25,000 crores worth economy, expected to grow at the compound annual growth rate of about 35 per-cent. Economic slowdowns in India, such as in 2019, have hence affected corporate sponsorships and puja budgets for public celebrations. In August 2019, the Income Tax Department of India had allegedly sent notices to various Durga Puja organizing committees in West Bengal, against which the ruling party of the state, All India Trinamool Congress (AITMC) protested. The Central Board of Direct Taxes denied sending any such notices, to which AITMC politician Madan Mitra is reported to have said that the intention may have been to enquire if tax deducted at source had been deducted on payments to vendors for organizing community pujas.

Economic significance
Durga Puja directly affects the economy. In 2022, the economy of West Bengal was estimated to get a boost of 50,000 crore rupees. The annual GDP of West Bengal was expected to be expanded by 20-30 percent that year. The factors responsible for this economic boost are mainly the increase of earning in transport, tourism, industry, business, shopping and other fields. The Kolkata Metro Railway recorded an earning of ₹6 crore in just five days of Durga Puja in 2022.
The famous puja pandals get sponsorship from renowned companies and labels. Usually, the dress and jewelries of the idols, the material used to make the typically very elaborate pandals, decorations, lightings are sponsored.

Social significance
Durga Puja plays a great significance in the living of certain peoples. The kumors, those who make the idols with clay and also makes other clayey products, earns lakhs of rupees by selling a single set of Durga idol of average size. Hence, it makes their annual income because idols used in other festivals are a lot more cheaper. Other professions that receive the majority of their annual income are dhaaki (plays dhaak), priest and other small homecrafts. It is assumed that these profession based small classes would become smaller in population if Durga Puja was absent.

Media attention
The day of Mahalaya is marked by the Indian Hindu community of West Bengal with Mahishasuramardini — a two-hours long All India Radio program — that has been popular in the Bengali community since the 1950s. While in earlier days it used to be recorded live, a pre-recorded version has come to be broadcast in recent decades. Bengalis traditionally wake up at four in the morning on Mahalaya to listen to the radio show, primarily involving recitations of chants and hymns from Devi Mahatmyam (or Chandi Path) by Birendra Krishna Bhadra and Pankaj Kumar Mullick. The show also features various devotional melodies.
Dramas enacting the legend of Durga slaying Mahishasura are telecasted on the television. Radio and television channels also air other festive shows, while Bengali and Odia magazines publish special editions for the puja known as Pujabarshiki (Annual Puja Edition) or Sharadiya Sankhya (Autumnal Volume). These contain works of writers, both established and upcoming, and are more voluminous than the regular issues. Some notable examples of such magazines in Bengali are Anandamela, Shuktara, Desh, Sananda, Nabakallol, and Bartaman.

Celebrations outside India

Etymology
Gaan-Ngai translates to ""winter festival"" in the Zemeic languages with Gaan meaning ""winter"" or ""dry season"" and Ngai meaning festival.

Background
According to legend and folklore, life began after the creation of the universe including earth by Tingkao Ragwang, the creator and almighty god. Gods and humans shared a common dormitory called khangchu in the house of Tingpu Rengsonnang, where they were not on friendly terms and men were often at the mercy of gods. Later, some of the men appeared in the physical form of khodiai (bee) and bit the gods, which led to the gods fleeing away.
Cooked rice on paddy plants was granted to be readily consumed as a food. There was abundance of rice, so that there was always surplus after consumption. While humans achieved peace initially, they multiplied as ages passed and the cooked rice was no more available post the fleeing of the gods. Thingpu Rengsonnang, the householder of the dormitory, visited the surroundings and found fertile soil, conducive for vegetation and proclaimed that the villagers should go for cultivation. As only raw rice could be obtained from paddy, they prayed to Tingkao Rangwang for help. After a long time of prayers, they saw smoke emanating from the ground, which was generated from a earthen pot in which a fire was burning. The fire was used to cook the raw rice and the humans were able to consume cooked rice again. The festival is celebrated as to commemorate the coming of light or fire.

It is generally a white rectangular piece of cloth with primarily a red border on three sides and red woven motifs on the fourth (in addition to red, other colors are also used). Although cotton yarn is the most common material for making/weaving gamosas, there are special occasion ones made from Pat silk.
A 1,455.3 meter long Gamusa displayed in Delhi created world record as it became the world's longest hand woven piece of cloth.

Origin of the name
Literally translated, it means 'something to wipe the body with' (Ga=body, musa=to wipe) however, interpreting the word gamosa as the towel is misleading. The word gamosa is derived from the Kamrupi word gamsaw, the cloth used to cover
the Bhagavad Purana at the altar.

Usage
Though it is used as a turban or scarf, the use is not restricted to this.

It is used to cover the altar at the prayer hall or cover the scriptures. An object of reverence is never placed on the bare ground, but always on a gamusa.
It is used by the farmer, fishermen or hunter as a waistcloth (tongali) or a loincloth (suriya).
A Bihu dancer wraps it around the head with a fluffy knot (see picture).
It is hung around the neck at the prayer hall (naamghar) and was thrown over the shoulder in the past to signify social status.
Guests are welcomed with the offering of a gamusa and tamul (betel nut) and elders are offered gamusas (referred to as bihuwaan in this case) during Bihu.
It may be used as a towel to wipe the body after a bath (an act of purification).
One can therefore, very well say, that the gamusa symbolizes the indigenous life and culture of Assam.

Cultural significance
Significantly the gamusa is used equally by all irrespective of religious and ethnic backgrounds.
At par with gamusa, there are beautifully woven symbolic clothes with attractive graphic designs being used by different cultural sub-systems and ethno-cultural groups as well.

There were various other symbolic elements and designs traditionally in use, which are now only found in literature, art, sculpture, architecture, etc. or used for only religious purposes (in particular occasions only). The typical designs of Assamese-lion, dragon, flying-lion, etc. were used for symbolizing various purposes and occasions.

On December 13 of 2022, Gamosa of Assam received the Geographical Indication tag.

Description
Holi is a sacred ancient tradition of Hindus, a holiday in many states of India with regional holidays in other countries. It is a cultural celebration that gives Hindus and non-Hindus alike an opportunity to have fun and play with other people by throwing coloured water and powder at each other. It is also observed broadly on the Indian subcontinent. Holi is celebrated at the end of winter, on the last full moon day of the Hindu luni-solar calendar month, marking the spring, making the date vary with the lunar cycle. The date falls typically in March, but sometimes late February of the Gregorian calendar.
The festival has many purposes; most prominently, it celebrates the beginning of spring. In 17th century literature, it was identified as a festival that celebrated agriculture, commemorated good spring harvests, and the fertile land. Hindus believe it is a time to enjoying spring's abundant colors and say farewell to winter. To many Hindus, Holi festivities mark an occasion to reset and renew ruptured relationships, end conflicts, and rid themselves of accumulated emotional impurities from the past.
It also has a religious purpose, symbolically signified by the legend of Holika. The night before Holi, bonfires are lit in a ceremony known as Holika Dahan (burning of Holika) or Little Holi. People gather near fires, sing and dance. The next day, Holi, also known as Dhuli in Sanskrit, or Dhulheti, Dhulandi or Dhulendi, is celebrated.
In northern parts of India, children spray coloured powder solutions (gulal) at each other, laugh, and celebrate, while adults smear dry coloured powder (abir) on each other's faces. Visitors to homes are first teased with colours, then served with Holi delicacies (such as gujhia, shakkarpaare, matri, and dahi vada), desserts and drinks. After playing with colours, and cleaning up, people bathe, put on clean clothes, and visit friends and family.
 Like Holika Dahan, Kama Dahanam is celebrated in some parts of India. The festival of colours in these parts is called Rangapanchami, and occurs on the fifth day after Poornima (full moon).

History
The Holi festival is an ancient Hindu festival with its own cultural rituals which emerged before the Gupta period. The festival of colours finds mentioned in numerous scriptures, such as in works like Jaimini's Purva Mimamsa Sutras and Kathaka-Grhya-Sutras with even more detailed descriptions in ancient texts like the Narada Purana and Bhavishya Purana. The festival of ""holikotsav"" was also mentioned in the 7th century work, Ratnavali, by King Harsha. It is mentioned in the Puranas, Dasakumara Charita by Daṇḍin, and by the poet Kālidāsa during the 4th century reign of Chandragupta II.
The celebration of Holi is also mentioned in the 7th-century Sanskrit drama Ratnavali. The festival of Holi caught the fascination of European traders and British colonial staff by the 17th century. Various old editions of the Oxford English Dictionary mention it, but with varying, phonetically derived spellings: Houly (1687), Hooly (1698), Huli (1789), Hohlee (1809), Hoolee (1825), and Holi in editions published after 1910.

Legends
Radha Krishna
In the Braj region of India, where the Hindu deities Radha and Krishna grew up, the festival is celebrated until Rang Panchmi in commemoration of their divine love for each other. The festivities officially usher in spring, with Holi celebrated as a festival of love. Garga Samhita, a puranic work by Sage Garga was the first work of literature to mention the romantic description of Radha and Krishna playing Holi. There is also a popular symbolic legend behind the festival. In his youth, Krishna despaired whether the fair-skinned Radha would like him because of his dark skin colour. His mother Yashoda, tired of his desperation, asks him to approach Radha and ask her to colour his face in any colour she wanted. This Radha did, and Radha and Krishna became a couple. Ever since, the playful colouring of Radha and Krishna's faces has been commemorated as Holi. Beyond India, these legends help to explain the significance of Holi (Phagwah), which is common in some Caribbean communities of Indian origin such as Guyana, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica. It is also celebrated with great fervour in Mauritius, Fiji, and South Africa.

Vishnu
There is a symbolic legend found in the 7th chapter of the Bhagavata Purana explaining why Holi is celebrated as a festival of triumph of good over evil in the honour of Hindu god Vishnu and his devotee Prahlada. King Hiranyakashipu, the father of Prahlada, was the king of demonic Asuras and had earned a boon that gave him five special powers: he could be killed by neither a human being nor an animal, neither indoors nor outdoors, neither at day nor at night, neither by astra (projectile weapons) nor by any shastra (handheld weapons), and neither on land nor in water or air. Hiranyakashipu grew arrogant, thought he was God, and demanded that everyone worship only him.
Hiranyakashipu's own son, Prahlada, however, remained devoted to Vishnu. This infuriated Hiranyakashipu. He subjected Prahlada to cruel punishments, none of which affected the boy or his resolve to do what he thought was right. Finally, Holika, Prahlada's evil aunt, tricked him into sitting on a pyre with her. Holika was wearing a cloak that made her immune to injury from fire, while Prahlada was not. As the fire spread, the cloak flew from Holika and encased Prahlada, who survived while Holika burned. Vishnu, the god who appears as an avatar to restore Dharma in Hindu beliefs, took the form of Narasimha – half human and half lion (which is neither a human nor an animal), at dusk (when it was neither day nor night), took Hiranyakashyapu at a doorstep (which was neither indoors nor outdoors), placed him on his lap (which was neither land, water nor air), and then eviscerated and killed the king with his lion claws (which were neither a handheld weapon nor a launched weapon).
The Holika bonfire and Holi signifies the celebration of the symbolic victory of good over evil, of Prahlada over Hiranyakashipu, and of the fire that burned Holika.

Kama and Rati
Among other Hindu traditions such as Shaivism and Shaktism, the legendary significance of Holi is linked to Shiva in yoga and deep meditation. Goddess Parvati wanting to bring Shiva back into the world, seeks help from the Hindu god of love called Kamadeva on Vasant Panchami. The love god shoots arrows at Shiva, the yogi opens his third eye and burns Kama to ashes. This upsets both Kama's wife Rati (Kamadevi) and his own wife Parvati. Rati performs her own meditative asceticism for forty days, upon which Shiva understands, forgives out of compassion and restores the god of love. This return of the god of love, is celebrated on the 40th day after the Vasant Panchami festival as Holi. The Kama legend and its significance to Holi has many variant forms, particularly in South India.

Cultural significance
The Holi festival has a cultural significance among various Hindu traditions of the Indian subcontinent. It is the festive day to end and rid oneself of past errors, to end conflicts by meeting others, a day to forget and forgive. People pay or forgive debts, as well as deal anew with those in their lives. Holi also marks the start of spring, an occasion for people to enjoy the changing seasons and make new friends.
Holi is of particular significance in the Braj region, which includes locations traditionally associated with Radha Krishna: Mathura, Vrindavan, Nandgaon, Barsana, and Gokula. These places are popular tourist attractions during Holi.
Outside India, Holi is observed by Hindus in Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan as well as in countries with large diaspora populations from India around the world. The Holi rituals and customs can vary with local adaptations.

Other Indian religions
The festival has traditionally been also observed by non-Hindus, such as by Sikhs, Jains and Newars (Nepal).
In Mughal India, Holi was celebrated with such exuberance that people of all castes could throw colour on the Emperor. According to Sharma (2017), ""there are several paintings of Mughal emperors celebrating Holi"". Grand celebrations of Holi were held at the Lal Qila, where the festival was also known as Eid-e-gulaabi or Aab-e-Pashi. Mehfils were held throughout the walled city of Delhi with aristocrats and traders alike participating. This changed during the rule of Emperor Aurangzeb. He banned the public celebration of Holi using a Farman issue in November 1665. However, the celebration were later restarted after the death of Emperor Aurangzeb. Bahadur Shah Zafar himself wrote a song for the festival, while poets such as Amir Khusrau, Ibrahim Raskhan, Nazeer Akbarabadi and Mehjoor Lakhnavi relished it in their writings.
Sikhs have traditionally celebrated the festival, at least through the 19th century, with its historic texts referring to it as Hola. Guru Gobind Singh – the last human guru of the Sikhs – modified Holi with a three-day Hola Mohalla extension festival of martial arts. The extension started the day after the Holi festival in Anandpur Sahib, where Sikh soldiers would train in mock battles, compete in horsemanship, athletics, archery and military exercises.
Holi was observed by Maharaja Ranjit Singh and his Sikh Empire that extended across what are now northern parts of India and Pakistan. According to a report by Tribune India, Sikh court records state that 300 mounds of colours were used in 1837 by Ranjit Singh and his officials in Lahore. Ranjit Singh would celebrate Holi with others in the Bilawal gardens, where decorative tents were set up. In 1837, Sir Henry Fane who was the commander-in-chief of the British Indian army joined the Holi celebrations organised by Ranjit Singh. A mural in the Lahore Fort was sponsored by Ranjit Singh and it showed the Hindu god Krishna playing Holi with gopis. After the death of Ranjit Singh, his Sikh sons and others continued to play Holi every year with colours and lavish festivities. The colonial British officials joined these celebrations.

Celebrations
Holika Dahan
The night before Holi is called Holika Dahan or ""Chhoti Holi"" whereby people gather around a lit bonfire, symbolising the victory of good over evil as well as the removal of the old and arrival of the new. Various rituals are performed around the fire such as singing and dancing. This ritual is derived from the story of Holika, who attempted to kill Prahlada, the son of Hiranyakashipu, through the flames of a bonfire. Although Holika was endowed with a boon to remain immune to fire, she was burned to ashes, while Prahlada remained unharmed.

Main day
The next morning is celebrated as Rangwali Holi (Dhuleti) where people smear and drench each other with colours. Water guns and water-filled balloons are often used to play and colour each other, with anyone and any place being considered fair game to colour. Groups often carry drums and other musical instruments going from place to place, singing and dancing. Throughout the day, people visit family, and friends and foes come together to chat, enjoy food and drinks, and partake in Holi delicacies. Holi is also a festival of forgiveness and new starts, which ritually aims to generate harmony in society. Many cities in Uttar Pradesh also organise Kavi sammelan in the evening.
Groups sing and dance, some playing drums and dholak. After each stop of fun and play with colours, people offer gujiya, mathri, malpuas and other traditional delicacies. Cold drinks, including drinks made with marijuana, are also part of the Holi festivity.

India
Bihar, Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand
Holi is known as Phaguwa or Fagua in the Bhojpuri language. In this region as well, the legend of Holika is prevalent. On the eve of Phalgun Poornima, people light bonfires. They put dried cow dung cakes, wood of the Araad or Redi tree and Holika tree, grains from the fresh harvest and unwanted wood leaves in the bonfire. At the time of Holika people assemble near the pyre. The eldest member of the gathering or a purohit initiates the lighting. He then smears others with colour as a mark of greeting. Next day the festival is celebrated with colours and much frolic. Traditionally, people also clean their houses to mark the festival.
Holi Milan is also observed in Bihar, where family members and well-wishers visit each other's family, apply colours (abeer) on each other's faces, and on feet, if elderly. Usually, this takes place on the evening of Holi, day after Holi with wet colours is played in the morning through the afternoon. Due to large-scale internal migration issues faced by the people, recently, this tradition has slowly begun to transform, and it is common to have Holi Milan on an entirely different day either before or after the actual day of Holi.
Children and youths take extreme delight in the festival. Though the festival is usually celebrated with colours, in some places, people also enjoy celebrating Holi with water solutions of mud or clay. Folk songs are sung at high pitch and people dance to the sound of the dholak (a two-headed hand-drum) and the spirit of Holi. Intoxicating bhang, made from cannabis, milk and spices, is consumed with a variety of mouth-watering delicacies, such as pakoras and thandai, to enhance the mood of the festival.
In the Kanpur, Holi lasts for seven days. On the last day, a fair called Ganga Mela or the Holi Mela is celebrated. The fair was started by freedom fighters who fought British rule.
In Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh, a special event called ""Holi Milan"" is celebrated.

Goa
Holi is locally called Ukkuli in Konkani. It is celebrated around the Konkani temple called Gosripuram temple. It is a part of the Goan or Konkani spring festival known as Śigmo or शिगमो in Koṅkaṇī or Śiśirotsava, which lasts for about a month. The colour festival or Holi is a part of longer, more extensive spring festival celebrations. Holi festivities (but not Śigmo festivities) include: Holika Puja and Dahan, Dhulvad or Dhuli vandan, Haldune or offering yellow and saffron colour or Gulal to the deity.

Gujarat
In Gujarat, Holi is a two-day festival. On the evening of the first day, a bonfire is lit and raw coconut and corn is offered to the fire. The second day is the festival of colour or ""Dhuleti"", celebrated by sprinkling coloured water and applying colours to each other. Dwarka, a coastal city of Gujarat, celebrates Holi at the Dwarkadhish temple with citywide music festivities. Holi marks the agricultural season of the rabi crop.
In some places, there is a custom in undivided Hindu families that the woman beats her brother-in-law with a sari rolled up into a rope in a mock rage and tries to drench him with colours, and in turn, the brother-in-law brings sweets (Indian desserts) to her in the evening.

Jammu and Kashmir
In Jammu and Kashmir, Holi celebrations are much in line with the general definition of Holi celebrations: a high-spirited festival to mark the beginning of the harvesting of the summer crop, with the throwing of coloured water and powder and singing and dancing.

Karnataka
Traditionally, in rural Karnataka, children collect money and wood in the weeks prior to Holi, and on ""Kamadahana"" night, all the wood is put together and lit. The festival is celebrated for two days. People in northern parts of Karnataka prepare special food on this day. Holi festival is also depicted on medieval reliefs and sculptures, notably on 12th century Chennakesava temple in Belur and 15th century relief from Hampi, where people are dipicted playing holi with colors and pichkaris.
In Sirsi, Karnataka, Holi is celebrated with a unique folk dance called ""Bedara Vesha"", which is performed during the nights beginning five days before the actual festival day. The festival is celebrated every alternate year in the town, which attracts a large number of tourists from different parts of India.
Wooden idols of Kamanna and Rati are put on public display and taken on parade in some parts of Karnataka. Large idols of Kama made of bamboo are burnt after Holi Hunnime festival in northern Karnataka. Ramalinga Kamanna Utsava is a unique festival celebrated in Navalgund, Karnataka, during Holi. The festivities center around the installation of an idol of Kamanna, representing Kamadeva (the god of love), at the Ramalingeshwara Temple. Devotees from various regions gather to offer silver articles, such as cradles for those desiring children, believing their wishes will be fulfilled.

Maharashtra
In Konkan region of Maharashtra, Holi season is also celebrated as Shimga or shimgo, festivities that lasts for almost a month. A week before the festival, youngsters go around the community, collecting firewood and money. On the day of holi, the firewood is heaped into a huge pile in each neighbourhood. In the evening, the fire is lit. Every household brings a meal and dessert, in the honour of the fire god. Puran Poli is the main delicacy and children shout ""Holi re Holi puranachi poli"". Shimga celebrates the elimination of all evil. The colour celebrations here take place on the day of Rang Panchami, five days after main day of holi. During this festival, people are supposed to forget and forgive any rivalries and start new healthy relations with all.

Manipur
Manipuris celebrate Holi for 6 days. Here, this holiday merges with the festival of Yaosang. Traditionally, the festival commences with the burning of a thatched hut of hay and twigs. Young children go from house to house to collect money, locally known as nakadeng (or nakatheng), as gifts on the first two days. The youths at night perform a group folk dance called Thabal chongba on the full moon night of Lamta (Phalgun), traditionally accompanied by folk songs and rhythmic beats of the indigenous drum, but nowadays by modern bands and fluorescent lamps. In Krishna temples, devotees sing devotional songs, perform dances and celebrate with aber (gulal) wearing traditional white and yellow turbans. On the last day of the festival, large processions are taken out to the main Krishna temple near Imphal where several cultural activities are held. In recent decades, Yaosang, a type of Indian sport, has become common in many places of the valley, where people of all ages come out to participate in a number of sports that are somewhat altered for the holiday.

Odisha
The people of Odisha celebrate Dola or Pushpadola (Dola Jatra purnima) on the day of Holi where the icons of Jagannath replace the icons of Krishna and Radha. Dola Melana, processions of the deities are celebrated in villages and bhoga is offered to the deities. ""Dola yatra"" was prevalent even before 1560 much before Holi was started where the idols of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra used to be taken to the ""Dolamandapa"" (podium in Jagannath temple). People used to offer natural colours known as ""abira"" to the deities and apply on each other's feats.

Punjab
In Punjab, the eight days preceding Holi are known as luhatak. Sekhon (2000) states that people start throwing colours many days before Holi.
Holi is preceded by Holika Dahan the night before when a fire is lit. Historically, the Lubana community of Punjab celebrated holi ""with great pomp and show. The Lubanas buried a pice and betel nut. They heaped up cow-dung cakes over the spot and made a large fire. When the fire had burnt out, they proceeded to hunt for the pice and betel-nut. Whosoever found these, was considered very lucky."" Elsewhere in Punjab, Holi was also associated with making fools of others. Bose writing in Cultural Anthropology: And Other Essays in 1929 noted that ""the custom of playing Holi-fools is prevalent in Punjab"".
On the day of Holi, people engage in throwing colours on each other. For locals, Holi marks the end of winter. The Punjabi saying Phaggan phal laggan (Phagun is the month for fructifying) exemplifies the seasonal aspect of Holi. Trees and plants start blossoming from the day of Basant and start bearing fruit by Holi.
During Holi in Punjab, walls and courtyards of rural houses are enhanced with drawings and paintings similar to rangoli in South India, mandana in Rajasthan, and rural arts in other parts of India. This art is known as chowk-poorana or chowkpurana in Punjab and is given shape by the peasant women of the state. In courtyards, this art is drawn using a piece of cloth. The art includes drawing tree motifs, flowers, ferns, creepers, plants, peacocks, palanquins, geometric patterns along with vertical, horizontal and oblique lines. These arts add to the festive atmosphere.
Folk theatrical performances known as swang or nautanki take place during Holi, with the latter originating in the Punjab. According to Self (1993), Holi fairs are held in the Punjab which may go on for many days. Bose (1961) states that ""in some parts of Punjab, Holi is celebrated with wrestling matches"".

Telangana
Holi is called as Kamuni Punnami/Kama Purnima or Jajiri in Telugu. Hindus celebrate Holi as it relates to the legend of Kamadeva. Holi is also known by different names: Kamavilas, Kamuni Panduga and Kama-Dahanam.
It is a 10-day festival in Telangana, of which last two days are of great importance. As in other parts of India, in rural Telangana, the 9 days preceding Holi, children celebrate kamuda by playing Kolata sticks along with singing folk songs called jajiri and collect money, rice, corn and wood. For this reason Holi is well known for ""Jajiri Paatalu Kamudi aatalu"", which means festival of ""Jajiri songs and Kamudi games"" and on 9th night i.e. Holy eve, all the wood is put together and set on fire representing Kama Dahanam.
Next morning i.e. 10th day is celebrated as Holi, with colours traditionally extracted from Moduga/Gogu Flowers (Palash/Butea monosperma).

Tripura
In Tripura Holi is known as ""Pali"" which means colour in Tripuri language, it's celebrated all over Tripura.

Western Uttar Pradesh
Barsana, a town near Mathura in the Braj region of Uttar Pradesh, celebrates Lathmar Holi in the sprawling compound of the Radha Rani Temple. Thousands gather to witness the Lath Mar Holi when women beat up men with sticks as those on the sidelines become hysterical, sing Holi songs and shout ""Radhe Radhe"" or ""Sri Radhe Krishna"". The Holi songs of Braj Mandal are sung in pure Braj, the local language. Holi celebrated at Barsana is unique in the sense that here women chase men away with sticks. Males also sing provocative songs in a bid to invite the attention of women. Women then go on the offensive and use long staves called lathis to beat the men, who protect themselves with shields.
Mathura, in the Braj region, is the birthplace of Krishna. In Vrindavan this day is celebrated with special puja and the traditional custom of worshipping Radha Krishna; here the festival lasts for sixteen days. All over the Braj region and neighbouring places like Hathras, Aligarh, and Agra, Holi is celebrated in more or less the same way as in Mathura, Vrindavan and Barsana.
A traditional celebration includes Matki Phod, similar to Dahi Handi in Maharashtra and Gujarat during Krishna Janmashtami, both in the memory of god Krishna who is also called makhan chor (literally, butter thief). This is a historic tradition of the Braj region as well as the western region of India. An earthen pot filled with butter or other milk products is hung high by a rope. Groups of boys and men climb on each other's shoulders to form pyramids to reach and break it, while girls and women sing songs and throw coloured water on the pyramid to distract them and make their job harder. This ritual sport continues in Hindu diaspora communities.

Kumaoni Holi in Uttarakhand includes a musical affair. It takes different forms such as the Baithki Holi, the Khari Holi and the Mahila Holi. In Baithki Holi and Khari Holi, people sing songs with a touch of melody, fun, and spiritualism. These songs are essentially based on classical ragas. Baithki Holi (बैठकी होली), also known as Nirvan Ki Holi, begins from the premises of temples, where Holiyars (होल्यार) sing Holi songs and people gather to participate, along with playing classical music. The songs are sung in a particular sequence depending on the time of day; for instance, at noon the songs are based on Peelu, Bhimpalasi and Sarang ragas, while evening songs are based on the ragas such as Kalyan, Shyamkalyan and Yaman. The Khari Holi (खड़ी होली) is mostly celebrated in the rural areas of Kumaon. The songs of the Khari Holi are sung by the people, who, sporting traditional white churidar payajama and kurta, dance in groups to the tune of ethnic musical instruments such as the dhol and hurka.
In the Kumaon region, the Holika pyre, known as Cheer (चीर), is ceremonially built in a ceremony known as Cheer Bandhan (चीर बंधन) fifteen days before Dulhendi. The Cheer is a bonfire with a green Paiya tree branch in the middle. The Cheer of every village and neighbourhood is rigorously guarded as rival mohallas try to playfully steal each other's cheer.
The colours used on Holi are derived from natural sources. Dulhendi, known as Charadi (छरड़ी) (from Chharad (छरड़)), is made from flower extracts, ash and water. Holi is celebrated with great gusto much in the same way all across North India.

West Bengal
In West Bengal, the tradition of Dol Jatra (meaning Swing procession) or Dolotsava (meaning Swing Festival) or Dol Purnima - (Swing Full Moon) is common among Gaudiya Vaishnavs just like among Vaishnavs in Braj region and other Krishna centric sampradays all over India. However, several Bengali Vaishnava padavalis also use the term Holi (Bangla: হোলী) for the festival.

In Shantiniketan, West Bengal, Holi is additionally also known as ""Basanta Utsab"". The festival is celebrated by worshipping the icons of Radha and Krishna by placing them on a decorated swing. On the Dol Purnima day in the early morning, students (mainly in Shantiniketan) dress up in saffron-coloured or pure white clothes and wear garlands of fragrant flowers. They sing and dance to the accompaniment of musical instruments, such as the ektara, dubri, and veena. The devotees take turns to swing them while women dance around the swing and sing songs. During these activities, the people keep throwing coloured water and dry colours, abir, at them.
Around 500 years ago, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu went to Vrindavan in present-day Uttar Pradesh to witness the festival there at the birthplace of Lord Sri Krishna. After his return to Bengal, he thought of starting the festival here. So he asked his followers to smear color or abir to Lord Krishna's idol and then put that abir on each other. He also instructed them to give the other person a treat with a local sweet called malpoa. The biographies of Sri Chaitanya say that he was very fond of this sweet.

Nepal
Holi, also known as Phagu Purnima, along with many other Hindu festivals, is celebrated in Nepal as a national festival. It is an important major Nepal-wide festival along with Dashain and Tihar (Dipawali). It is celebrated in the Nepali month of Falgun (Terai region celebrates on the same date as Indian Holi, while rest of the country celebrates it a day earlier), and signifies the legends of the Hindu god Krishna. They worship Saraswati shrine in Vajrayogini temples and celebrate the festival with their Hindu friends.
Traditional concerts are held in most cities in Nepal, including Kathmandu, Narayangarh, Pokhara, Itahari, Hetauda, and Dharan, and are broadcast on television with various celebrity guests.
People walk through their neighbourhoods to celebrate Holi by exchanging colours and spraying coloured water on one another. A popular activity is the throwing of water balloons at one another, sometimes called lola (meaning water balloon). Many people mix bhang (made from cannabis, milk and spices) in their drinks and food, as is also done during Shivaratri. It is believed that the combination of different colours at this festival takes all sorrow away and makes life itself more colourful.

Pakistan
Holi is celebrated by the minority Hindu population in Pakistan. Community events by Hindus have been reported by Pakistani media in various cities such as Karachi, Hazara, Rawalpindi, Sindh, Hyderabad, Multan and Lahore. The Hindu tribes of Cholistan play the game called Khido in the days leading up to the Holi. The game Khido is considered sacred by them as it is believed that Parhlad used to play this game during his childhood.
However, some cases have been reported where Hindus have been discriminated against and attacked while celebrating Holi in educational institutions. 
Holi was not a public holiday in Pakistan from 1947 to 2016. Holi along with Diwali for Hindus, and Easter for Christians, was adopted as public holiday resolution by Pakistan's parliament in 2016, giving the local governments and public institutions the right to declare Holi as a holiday and grant leave for its minority communities, for the first time. This decision has been controversial, with some Pakistanis welcoming the decision, while others criticising it, with the concern that declaring Holi a public holiday advertises a Hindu festival to Pakistani children.

Indian diaspora
Over the years, Holi has become an important festival in many regions wherever Indian diaspora were either taken as indentured labourers during colonial era, or where they emigrated on their own, and are now present in large numbers such as in Africa, North America, Europe, Latin America, and parts of Asia such as Fiji.

Hindus believe it is a time of enjoying spring's abundant colours and saying farewell to winter. It is considered one of the most exhilarating religious holidays in existence. During this event, participants hold a bonfire, throw coloured powder at each other, and celebrate wildly.

United States
Holi is celebrated in many US states by mainly South Asian Americans, particularly those with Indian ancestry. It is usually hosted in Hindu temples or cultural halls. Members of Hindu associations and volunteers assist in hosting the event along with temple devotees. Some of the places known to celebrate Holi are New Brunswick (New Jersey), Spanish Fork (Utah), Houston (Texas), Dallas (Texas), South El Monte (California), Milpitas (California), Mountain House (California), Tracy (California), Lathrop (California), Chicago (Illinois), Potomac (Maryland), Tampa (Florida), Sterling (Virginia), and Boston (Massachusetts).

Indonesia
In Indonesia, Indian Indonesians and Balinese Hindu people celebrate Holi as festival of colours. The main celebrations are in Medan and Bali.
Sometimes the Indian immigrants from other countries may also celebrate a small-scale version of Holi.

Holi colours
Traditional sources of colours
The spring season, during which the weather changes, is believed to cause viral fever and cold. The playful throwing of natural coloured powders, called gulal has a medicinal significance: the colours are traditionally made of palash, neem, kumkum, haldi, bilva, and other medicinal herbs suggested by Āyurvedic doctors.
Many colours are obtained by mixing primary colours. Artisans produce and sell many of the colours from natural sources in dry powder form, in weeks and months preceding Holi. Some of the traditional natural plant-based sources of colours are:

Orange and red
The flowers of palash or tesu tree, also called the flame of the forest, are typical source of bright red and deep orange colours. Powdered fragrant red sandalwood, dried hibiscus flowers, madder tree, radish, and pomegranate are alternate sources and shades of red. Mixing lime with turmeric powder creates an alternate source of orange powder, as does boiling saffron (kesar) in water.

Green
Mehendi and dried leaves of gulmohur tree offer a source of green colour. In some areas, the leaves of spring crops and herbs have been used as a source of green pigment.

Yellow
Haldi (turmeric) powder is the typical source of yellow colour. Sometimes this is mixed with chickpea (gram) or other flour to get the right shade. Bael fruit, amaltas, species of chrysanthemums, and species of marigold are alternate sources of yellow.

Blue
Indigo plant, Indian berries, species of grapes, blue hibiscus, and jacaranda flowers are traditional sources of blue colour for Holi.

Magenta and purple
Beetroot is the traditional source of magenta and purple colour. Often these are directly boiled in water to prepare coloured water.

Brown
Dried tea leaves offer a source of brown coloured water. Certain clays are alternate source of brown.

Black
Species of grapes, fruits of amla (gooseberry) and vegetable carbon (charcoal) offer grey to black colours.

Issues
Health impact
A 2007 study found that malachite green, a synthetic bluish-green dye used in some colours during Holi festival, was responsible for severe eye irritation in Delhi, if eyes were not washed upon exposure. Though the study found that the pigment did not penetrate through the cornea, malachite green is of concern and needs further study.
Another 2009 study reports that some colours produced and sold in India contain metal-based industrial dyes, causing an increase in skin problems to some people in the days following Holi. These colours are produced in India, particularly by small informal businesses, without any quality checks and are sold freely in the market. The colours are sold without labelling, and the consumer lacks information about the source of the colours, their contents, and possible toxic effects. In recent years, several non-governmental organisations have started campaigning for safe practices related to the use of colours. Some are producing and marketing ranges of safer colours derived from natural sources such as vegetables and flowers.
These reports have galvanised a number of groups into promoting more natural celebrations of Holi. Development Alternatives, Delhi's CLEAN India campaign, Kalpavriksh Environment Action Group, Pune, Society for Child Development through its Avacayam Cooperative Campaign have launched campaigns to help children learn to make their own colours for Holi from safer, natural ingredients. Meanwhile, some commercial companies such as the National Botanical Research Institute have begun to market ""herbal"" dyes, though these are substantially more expensive than the dangerous alternatives. However, it may be noted that many parts of rural India have always resorted to natural colours (and other parts of festivities more than colours) due to availability.
In urban areas, some people wear nose masks and sunglasses to avoid inhaling pigments and to prevent chemical exposure to eyes.

Environmental impact
An alleged environmental issue related to the celebration of Holi is the traditional Holika bonfire, which is believed to contribute to deforestation. According to a local tabloid, 30,000 bonfires burn every year during Holi, with each fire burning approximately 100 kilograms (220 lb) of wood.
The use of heavy metal-based pigments during Holi is also reported to cause temporary wastewater pollution, with the water systems recovering to pre-festival levels within 5 days.

Influence on other cultures
Holi is celebrated as a social event in parts of the United States. For example, at Sri Sri Radha Krishna Temple in Spanish Fork, Utah, NYC Holi Hai in Manhattan, New York, and Festival of Colors: Holi NYC in New York City, New York.

Holi-inspired events
A number of Holi-inspired social events have also surfaced, particularly in Europe and the United States, often organised by companies as for-profit or charity events with paid admission, and with varying scheduling that does not coincide with the actual Holi festival. These have included Holi-inspired music festivals such as the Festival Of Colours Tour and Holi One (which feature timed throws of Holi powder), and 5K run franchises such as The Color Run, Holi Run and Color Me Rad, in which participants are doused with the powder at per-kilometre checkpoints. The BiH Color Festival is a Holi-inspired electronic music festival held annually in Brčko, Bosnia and Herzegovina. In recent years, schools across Australia have also adopted Holi inspired fund raising activities which leverage fundraising platforms such as Australian Fundraising, School Fun Run, Colour Frenzy and Go Raise It Australia to conduct such events. New Zealand schools have also followed the trend with holi powder Colour Run fundraisers run by local company Go Raise It NZ.

Some break their daylong fast at midnight with a feast. Krishna Janmashtami is widely celebrated across India and abroad.

Etymology
The meaning of the Sanskrit word Janmashtami can be understood by splitting it into the two words, ""Janma"" and ""Ashtami."" The word ""Janma"" means birth and the word ""Ashtami"" means eight; thus, Krishna Janmashtami is the celebration of Krishna's birth on the eighth day of the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) in the month of Bhadrapada (August–September).

History
Information about Krishna's life is noted in the Mahabharata, the Puranas, and Bhagavata Purana. Krishna is the eighth son of Devaki (mother) and Vasudeva (father).  Surrounding the time of his birth, persecution was rampant, freedoms were being denied, and King Kamsa's life was threatened. Krishna was born within a prison in Mathura, India where his parents were constrained by his uncle, Kamsa. During Devaki's wedding, Kamsa was warned by a celestial voice that Devaki's eighth son would be the cause of his death. In an effort to defy this prophesy, Kamsa imprisoned his sister Devaki and her husband and promptly killed the first six of her newborns after their birth. The guards responsible for keeping watch over Devaki's cell fell asleep and the cell doors were miraculously opened at the time of Krishna's birth. These events allowed Vasudeva to send Krishna across the Yamuna River to his foster parents, Yashoda (mother) and Nanda (father). This legend is celebrated on Janmashtami by people keeping fasts, singing devotional songs of love for Krishna, and keeping a vigil into the night.
Throughout Krishna's childhood and young adult life, Balarama, Krishna's half-brother, was a ""constant companion"" for him. Balarama joined Krishna in the major events that are celebrated in Vraja, Brindavan, Dravarka, and Mathura such as stealing butter, chasing calves, playing in the cow pens, and participating in wrestling matches.

Observance and celebrations
Krishna Janmashtami holds significant importance to Krishnaites as well as Hindus around the world, and it is celebrated in diverse forms depending on their regional and cultural customs. Hindus celebrate Janmashtami by fasting, singing, praying together, preparing and sharing special food, night vigils, and visiting Krishna or Vishnu temples. The places of Mathura and Vrindavan are visited by pilgrims. Some mandirs organize recitation of Bhagavad Gita in the days leading up to Janmashtami. Many northern Indian communities organize dance-drama events called Rasa Lila or Krishna Lila. The tradition of Rasa Lila is particularly popular in the Mathura region, in northeastern states of India such as Manipur and Assam, and in parts of Rajasthan and Gujarat. It is acted out by numerous teams of amateur artists, cheered on by their local communities, and these drama-dance plays begin a few days before each Janmashtami. People decorate their houses with flowers and light. On this day, people chant ""Hare Krishna hare Krishna, Krishna- Krishna Hare Hare"". The Janmashtami celebration is followed by Dahi Handi, which is celebrated the next day.
After Krishna's midnight hour birth, forms of baby Krishna are bathed and clothed, then placed in a cradle. The devotees then break their fast by sharing food and sweets. Women draw tiny footprints outside their house doors and kitchen, walking towards their house, a symbolism for Krishna's journey into their homes.

Northern India
Janmashtami is the largest festival in the Braj region of north India, in cities such as Mathura where Krishna was born according to Krishnaism, and in Vrindavan where he grew up. Vaishnava communities in these cities in Uttar Pradesh, as well as others in the state, as well as locations in Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Himalayan north celebrate Janmashtami. Krishna temples are decorated and lighted up, they attract numerous visitors on the day, while Krishna devotees hold bhakti events and keep night vigil.
The festival typically falls as the monsoons in north India have begun retreating, fields laden with crops and rural communities have time to play. In the northern states, Janmashtami is celebrated with the Raslila tradition, which literally means ""play (Lila) of delight, essence (Rasa)"". This is expressed as solo or group dance and drama events at Janmashtami, wherein Krishna related compositions are sung, music accompanies the performance, while actors and audience share and celebrate the performance by clapping hands to mark the beat. The childhood pranks of Krishna and the love affairs of Radha-Krishna are particularly popular. According to Christian Roy and other scholars, these Radha-Krishna love stories are Hindu symbolism for the longing and love of the human soul for the divine or Brahman.
Poetry describing the feats of Krishna became popular in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries within the Braj region, and is written according to a vernacular called ""Braj basha"" (present-day ""Hindi""/dialect of ""Hindi""). The Braj basha poems of Surdas (collectively known as the Sursagar) are popularly recalled, some of which describe the birth and childhood of Krishna.

Jammu Region
In Jammu region, Janmashtami is popularly known by the name ""Thogre/Thakure da Vrat"" (meaning Vrat dedicated to Thakur i.e. Shri Krishna). Observing a Phalaahari Vrat for complete one day is the major ritual in the festival. The day is marked by numerous Phalaahari Dhaams or Bhandaras in the streets of Jammu region's prominent towns.
Janmashtami marks the beginning of the kite-flying season in the Jammu region whereby locals gather and fly decorated kites from their rooftops. While on the other hand, girls and women decorate their palms by applying Teera, dye of an indigenous plant.
Another ceremony associated with Janmashtami in Jammu region is ""Deyaa Parna"" in which Dogras donate cereal grains in the name of their ancestors & Kuldevtas. A holy tree called jand is worshipped by women on this day. Special rotis called draupads are prepared and offered to cows and deities.

Kashmir
Janmashtami is celebrated as Zaram Satam (Janam Saptami) by the native Kashmiri Pandits of Kashmir. The festival is associated with observing a vrat the whole day and visiting the Thokur Kuth (Krishna Mandir) at midnight. At night, puja is performed in the temples which includes performing abhishek (ritual bath) to the murti of Krishna, and singing bhajans (devotional songs). Food items appropriate for fasting, such as gaer or singhada lapsi (made from waterchestnut flour), fruits, and dried fruits are consumed on this day.

Maharashtra
Janmashtami (popularly known as ""Dahi Handii"" in Maharashtra) is celebrated in cities such as Mumbai, Latur, Nagpur and Pune. It is a celebration of joy and facilitator of social oneness. Dahi Handi is an enactment of how Krishna, during his childhood, would steal butter. This story is the theme of numerous reliefs on temples across India, as well as literature and dance-drama repertoire, symbolizing the joyful innocence of children, that love and life's play is the manifestation of god.
It is common practice for youth groups to celebrate the festival by participating in Dahi Handi, which involves hanging a clay pot, filled with buttermilk, at a significant height. Once hung, several youth groups compete to reach the pot by creating a human pyramid and breaking it open. The spilled contents are considered as prasada (celebratory offering). It is a public spectacle, cheered and welcomed as a community event.

Gujarat and Rajasthan
In Dwarka, Gujarat – where Krishna is believed to have established his kingdom – people celebrate the festival with a tradition similar to Dahi Handi, called Makhan Handi (pot with freshly churned butter). Others perform folk dances such and garba and raas, sing bhajans, and visit Krishna temples such as at the Dwarkadhish Temple or Nathdwara. In the Kutch district region, farmers decorate their bullock carts and take out Krishna processions, with group singing and dancing. The day is of special importance to followers of the Pushtimarg and the Swaminarayan movement.
The works of Gujarati poets, Narsinh Mehta (1414–1480 c.e.), Dayaram (1777–1852) and Rajasthani poet Mirabai (c.1500), are popularly revisited and sung during Janmashtami. Their works are categorized as part of the bhakti tradition, or devotional poetry dedicated to Krishna.

South India
In Kerala, people celebrate in September, according to the Malayalam calendar.

In Tamil Nadu, people decorate the floor with kolams (decorative pattern drawn with rice batter). Geetha Govindam and other such devotional songs are sung in praise of Krishna. Little footprints, representing Krishna as an infant, are drawn from the threshold of the house till the pooja (prayer) room, which depicts the arrival of Krishna into the house. Reciting from the Bhagavad Gita is also a popular practice. The offerings made to Krishna include fruits, betel and butter. Milk-based items, such as sweet seedai and verkadalai urundai, are prepared. The festival is celebrated in the evening as Krishna was born at midnight. Most people observe a strict fast on this day.

In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, recitation of shlokas and devotional songs are the characteristics of this festival. Another unique feature of this festival is that young boys are dressed up as Krishna and they visit neighbours and friends. The people of Andhra Pradesh observe a fast too. Various kinds of sweets such as chakodi, murukku, and seedai are offered to Krishna on this day. Joyful chanting of Krishna's name takes place in quite a few temples of the state. The number of temples dedicated to Krishna are few. The reason being that people have taken to worship him through paintings and not idols.
Popular south Indian temples dedicated to Krishna are Rajagopalaswamy Temple in Mannargudi in the Tiruvarur district, Pandavadhoothar temple in Kanchipuram, Sri Krishna temple at Udupi, and the Krishna temple at Guruvayur are dedicated to the memory of Vishnu's incarnation as Krishna. It is believed that the murti (idol) of Krishna installed in Guruvayur is originally from his kingdom in Dwarka – which is believed to be submerged in the sea.

Eastern and Northeastern India
Janmashtami is widely celebrated by Krishnaite and Hindu Vaishnava communities of eastern and northeastern India. The widespread tradition of celebrating Krishna in these regions is credited to the efforts and teachings of 15th and 16th century Sankardeva and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Sankardeva introduced the musical composition, Borgeet, and dance-drama styles – Ankia Naat and Sattriya - that is now popular in West Bengal and Assam. In Manipur state, a traditional dance - Raas Leela - inspired by the theme of love and devotion between Krishna, Radha and the gopis, is enacted using the Manipuri dance style. The contextual roots of these dance drama arts are found in the ancient text Natya Shastra, but with influences from the culture fusion between India and southeast Asia.

On Janmashtami, parents dress up their children as Krishna or the gopis. Temples and community centers are decorated with regional flowers and leaves, while groups recite or listen to the tenth chapter of the Bhagavata Purana, and the Bhagavata Gita.
Janmashtami is a major festival celebrated with fasts, vigil, recitation of scriptures and Krishna prayers in Manipur. Dancers performing Raslila are a notable annual tradition during Janmashtami in Mathura and Vrindavan. Children play the Likol Sannaba game in the Meetei Krishnaite community.
The Shree Govindajee Temple and the ISKCON temples particularly mark the Janmashtami festival. Janmashtami is celebrated in Assam at homes, in community centers called Namghars (Assamese: নামঘৰ). According to the tradition, the devotees sing the Nam, perform pujas and sharing food and Prasada.

Odisha and West Bengal
In the eastern state of Odisha, specifically the region around Puri and in Nabadwip, West Bengal, the festival is also referred to as Sri Krishna Jayanti or simply Sri Jayanti. People celebrate Janmashtami by fasting and worship until midnight. The Bhagavata Purana is recited from the 10th chapter, a section dedicated to the life of Krishna. The next day is called ""Nanda Ucchhaba"" or the joyous celebration of Krishna's foster parents Nanda and Yashoda. Devotees keep fasting during the entire day of Janmashtami. They bring water from Ganga to bathe Radha Madhaba during their abhisheka ceremony. A grand abhisheka is performed at midnight for the small Radha Madha. In Odisha, the Jagannath Temple in Puri, best known for its grand Ratha Yatra celebrations, perform a Ratha Yatra during Janmashtami.

Outside India
Nepal
About eighty percent of the population of Nepal identify themselves as Hindus and celebrate Krishna Janmashtami. They observe Janmashtami by fasting until midnight. It is a national holiday in Nepal. The devotees recite the Bhagavad Gita and sing religious songs called bhajans and kirtans. The temples of Krishna are decorated. Shops, posters and houses carry Krishna motifs.

Bangladesh
Janmashtami is a national holiday in Bangladesh. On Janmashtami, a procession starts from Dhakeshwari Temple in Dhaka, the National Temple of Bangladesh, and then proceeds through the streets of Old Dhaka. The procession dates back to 1902, but was stopped in 1948. The procession was resumed in 1989.

Fiji
At least a quarter of the population in Fiji practices Hinduism, and this holiday has been celebrated in Fiji since the first Indian indentured laborers landed there. Janmashtami in Fiji is known as ""Krishna Ashtami"". Most Hindus in Fiji have ancestors that originated from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Tamil Nadu, making this an especially important festival for them. Fiji's Janmashtami celebrations are unique in that they last for eight days, leading up to the eighth day, the day Krishna was born. During these eight days, Hindus gather at homes and at temples with their 'mandalis,' or devotional groups at evenings and night, and recite the Bhagavat Purana, sing devotional songs for Krishna, and distribute Prasadam.

Pakistan
Janmashtami is celebrated by Pakistani Hindus in the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Karachi with the singing of bhajans and delivering of sermons on Krishna. It is an optional holiday in Pakistan. Prior to the Partition of India, Dera Ghazi Khan was the center of a Janmashtami fair at the thallā of Kevalarāma. This fair is now recreated in Inder Puri, New Delhi.

Others
In Arizona, United States, Governor Janet Napolitano was the first American leader to greet a message on Janmashtami, while acknowledging ISKCON. The festival is also celebrated widely by Krishnaites in the Caribbean countries of Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica and Suriname. Many Hindus in these countries originate from Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar; descendants of indentured immigrants from Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, and Orissa.

Interpretations of meaning
Elangbam Nilakanta Singh translates Lai Haraoba as the “merry making of the gods and goddesses,” and many others use this meaning. Saroj Nalini Parratt and John Parratt translate it as “pleasing of the gods,” based on J. Shakespeare’s (1913) translation, but they make it plural because the festival honors more than one god. Practitioners of the ritual say that the name comes from the ""lai hoi laoba,"" the cry of ‘hoi’, in the Meitei creation myth, which marks the moment the universe is revealed. This idea is given by Ng. Kulachandra, the former head of the Manipur Pandit Loishang.

Origin
Lai Haraoba (Meitei: ꯂꯥꯏ ꯍꯔꯥꯎꯕ) is a ritualistic festival of the Meiteis observed since ancient times. It is a ritual enactment of the creation myth. It mirrors the entire culture of Manipur and depicts the close affinities between the hill and plain people. It is a combination of religious recitations, traditional music and dance, traditional social values and ancient cultural aspects.
The rituals within the festival are the same except in some items or hymns, such as ikouba, ikourol, and yakairol at the beginning and mikon thagonba, ngaprum tanba at the end of the festival. In the performances, the evolution story with the amorous love-affairs of Nongpok Ninghthou and Panthoibi is depicted and played equally in all kinds of lai haraoba. According to folklore, the gods held the first Lai Haraoba  on the Koubru Hill so that their descendants would imitate them by performing the same rites.

Places and timings
Lai Haraoba takes place at local shrines dedicated to the Umang Lai deities, which are important to the traditional Meitei religion. The festival doesn't have fixed dates but happens between February and May or June. Each shrine chooses its own dates for the festival. The festival can last from three days to over a month, depending on the shrine. The dates and length of the festival can be different for each shrine.

Deities
The Lai Haraoba is also called the Umang Lai Haraoba, named after the Umang Lai deities, honored during the festival. These deities are seen as protectors of the areas where the shrines are located. The festival takes place at these shrines, and the whole community helps with the preparations.
The Umang Lai group includes over 300 deities, such as ancestors, legendary forefathers, and other important gods in the traditional Meitei religion (Sanamahism).

Male and female aspects
The rituals of Lai Haraoba honor a male and a female deity, called Lainingthou and Lairembi/Lairemma. The rituals focus on creation. The Meitei people believe that the supreme god created the cosmos. He is called Tengbanba Mapu or Taibangpanba Mapu or Atiya Sidaba. Some creation stories start with these gods, while others go back to Atingkok and Amamba. Amamba is the dark place where life begins.

Types and variations
Four types of Lai Haraoba are prevalent in the Meitei society, namely, Kanglei Haraoba, Moirang Haraoba, Kakching Haraoba and Chakpa Haraoba. Kanglei Haraoba is performed mainly in Imphal and the nearby towns. Moirang Haraoba is only in Moirang, Kakching Haraoba is held in Kakching and Chakpa Haraoba is celebrated at Andro, Phayeng, Sekmai, Koutruk, Khuukhul, Leimaram and Tairenpokpi.

Kanglei Haraoba
One type of Lai Haraoba is Kanglei Haraoba, celebrated in and around Imphal. The name Kanglei comes from Kangla, which is in the center of Imphal. The main deity worshipped is Pakhangba. A special part of this festival is when Khoriphaba, a deity, looks for a ‘bride’. A maibi (spirit medium) calls on Khoriphaba's spirit to choose the bride. The festival ends with the nongarol, which shows the rise of the divine presence.

Moirang Haraoba
Moirang Haraoba is celebrated in and around the Moirang region in the southern part of the Imphal valley. The main deity worshipped is Thangching (Thangjing). In this version, along with langthrei leaves (a common offering in the Kanglei version), leisang, another evergreen plant, is also offered. A special part of this festival is the Khamba Thoibi classical dance. The festival ends with tengtharol (a song of lamentation), which marks the rise of the deities.

Chakpa Haraoba
Chakpa Haraoba is not a separate type of the festival, but a group of versions celebrated by Chakpa groups in different villages. The hand movements are simpler, and the structure is less complex. It includes sacrificial practices. The main versions are from Andro, Imphal East and Phayeng villages. In Andro, a special ritual called Numit Kappa (shooting of the sun) is performed, which is unique to them. The Phayeng tradition has special rituals, like ""Lai Phagi Tounaba,"" which are not done in other places.

Kakching Haraoba
Kakching Haraoba is celebrated in the Kakching region, east of Imphal. A special part of the festival is the ""Ngaprum Tanba"" ritual (hunting of eel) on the last day. People have different opinions on whether it should be a separate type of festival. Some think it should be part of Kanglei, while others think it should be under Chakpa Haraoba. Dr. Kh. Ratankumar Singh sees it as a separate type. However, each shrine often has its own unique practices.

Rituals
The Lai Haraoba rituals are led by special people. There are three old traditions. The three traditions are maiba, maibi, and asheiba (pena (musical instrument) is about the music with a special fiddle). Only men can follow maiba and asheiba. Only women can follow maibi, which is about connecting with spirits.
The Lai Haraoba rituals are detailed and cover many parts. They can be divided into three parts. These parts are the beginning, the middle, and the end. The parts are called Lai Eekouba, Haraoba, and Lairoi respectively. The Lai Eekouba marks the descent of the god (Lai in Meitei language). The Lairoi marks the ascent. The days in between follow a similar pattern. The number of days in between can change. This makes the festival last anywhere from three days to over three weeks.

Lai Eekouba
The Lai Eekouba rituals focus on bringing a sacred presence into the shrine for the festival. Before the rituals, the doors of the shrine, which are usually closed all year, are opened. This is called ""lai thong hangba,"" meaning ""opening of the shrine doors."" It happens on a lucky day before the Eekouba rituals. After opening, the shrine is cleaned, and sacred images and objects are prepared. The utensils are cleaned, clothes for the ceremonies are washed, and the sacred images are taken out. Sometimes, preparations begin even before opening the shrine, like making rice beer for the event. This process is done with special songs and rituals.
In the Eekouba ritual, the sacred presence is brought through water. This is done at a pond or river. A procession goes from the shrine to the water. There, offerings are made and deities are called. A maibi performs the ritual by chanting and ringing bells. The maibi may go into a trance and speak messages from the spirits. The sacred objects come to life during this time. Afterward, the procession returns to the shrine, and the objects are placed in their spots. The day ends with the pena (musical instrument) fiddle player, who plays music and sings to rest the deities for the night, with a rite called ""naosumba"". This is the first day of the festival.

Haraoba
The second day starts with the awakening rite (yakeiba). The pena fiddle player plays in the morning to wake up the deity. Some rituals are done, like bathing (iru sadengba) and removing bad energies (anam-aha kokpa). People bring fruits, rice, grains, flowers, incense, and candles as offerings. The morning prayers are recited, and the offerings are given.
The main ritual happens in the evening. Music and dance are an important part of it. They are not just for performance, but part of the ritual. The evening starts with offering flowers, called ""Lei Langba."" The person in charge of the flowers or their helper does this. The maibis show respect before starting the dance of Thougal Jagoi. This dance is a way to honor the Lai and get ready for the day’s work. The songs in the dance praise the deity. The maibis lead the dance, and everyone in the community can join. After the dance, the Laibou part of the ritual starts.

Laibou
The laibou rituals are the main part of the Lai Haraoba. Before this, a banana leaf with a small offering and sacred langthrei leaves are placed in the center of the area. The maibis then dance to bring the sacred presence into the space. This dance is called Laiching Jagoi, or ""the dance to draw out the deities."" The dance is accompanied only by the sound of the pena (musical instrument) fiddle, with no singing. After the dance, everyone shouts ""hoi"" together in a song called hoi laoba. They follow the maiba’s lead. The singing style is similar to the closing song, wakol laoba, but it is different from other ritual songs. This singing style is called ""antiphonal songs,"" which is different from other ritual songs.
The laibou rituals are performed in a procession that goes around the performance area. The rituals symbolize the creation of the human body, birth, building a house, farming, and weaving. The procession, led by the maibi, starts in front of the shrine and moves around the area, showing respect to the four directions and their deities.
The dance begins with the creation of the body. The maibi dances to show how each part of the body is made, like carving the eyes, drawing the brows, and marking the soles of the feet. Then, the baby is 'born' and cared for. As the child grows, clothing is needed. To make clothes, the hillside is cleared to grow cotton, which is then processed and woven. To protect the child, a house is built, with frames made and mud used to plaster the walls. When the child grows older, they go fishing, which symbolizes physical desires. Throughout this ritual, there are clear references to everyday life and culture.

After Laibou
After the Laibou, the Padon Jagoi follows. In this, the maibis form a line, led by a senior maibi, and dance in a serpentine pattern in the performance area. Next, a series of rites takes place, focusing on the phibul (a ball of cloth) and the phijang, which is a piece of white cloth held by four poles. These four poles form a ritual umbrella and banners. The four corners of the cloth are held by the poles. Two maibis, each holding a sacred object, dance around the poles, moving under the cloth. After the rites, the cloth is gathered up and returned to the shrine. It is sometimes called as a part of the ritual ""canopy cycle.""
The day ends with the participants drawing serpentine patterns, called ""Lairen Mathek Chatpa."" Then, the sacred objects are put back in the shrine, and the Wakol song is sung. The deities are put to rest with a lullaby called Naosumba, played by the pena.

Special rites
Some rites are done only on certain days. One is the ""Saroi Khangba,"" where food is offered to lesser spirits. Another is the ""Kanglei Thokpa,"" where the spirit of the deity Khoriphaba is called. This is also known as ""Lai Nupi Thiba,"" meaning ""search for the bride."" A more visible rite is the ""Lai Lam-thokpa"" street procession, where the procession moves outside with a big celebration and many people.

Lairoi
The Lairoi rituals happen on the last day and mark the end of the festival. These rituals focus on closing the sacred time and space of Lai Haraoba. One ritual is ""Thang Jagoi,"" a dance with blades, performed by a maibi at the four corners to remove bad energies. Another ritual is Loutaba, also called Tangkhul-Nurabi, which is about two important mythological figures. Loutaba is like a skit with comedy, myths, chants, and some improvisation. Other closing rituals include Ougri Hangel, Thawai Mi-konba, Sharit Litpa, and Khencho Chongba.
The sacred presence is let go with the Lai Nongaba rite, marking its departure and return to the other realm. A boat is made for this journey. The Uyarol songs describe the tree being cut down, and the Hijing Hirao songs describe making the boat. The ascent is marked by the Higa Ishei hymn, and the ritual ends with the Nongarol hymn.
When returning to the shrine, the sacred images and items used in the ritual are taken apart, all on the same night. A Leihun offering of langthrei leaves is made, and the shrine doors are closed for five days. On the fifth day, the maibi comes back to remove the offering and prepare a new one. This final rite, called Leihun Tamba, ends the Lairoi rituals.

Lai Haraoba Ishei
Lai Haraoba Ishei is a famous folk song played mainly during Lai Haraoba. This song contains lyrics with veiled references to erotic mysticism. The main quality of the song is the rhythm in its tune.

Sports
In Lai Haraoba, the day after the Lairoi (last day of rituals) was for sports events. These events included many traditional Meitei games and sports. Some of the games were Yubi Lakpi, which is a traditional Meitei rugby and uses an oiled slippery coconut and oiled bodies. Another game was Khong Kangjei, which is a traditional Meitei hockey. Mukna is a traditional Meitei wrestling, and mukna-kangjei is a mix of wrestling and hockey. Thouri Chingnaba is a traditional Meitei tug of war.

Influences on other performing arts
Dance forms of Lai Haraoba helped create the Manipuri dance style and inspired the Manipuri Ras Lila, one of India's classical dances. The focus on dance has shaped how people see and talk about Lai Haraoba, both in Manipur and outside. But Lai Haraoba is more than just dance, music, or religion. It is an important part of the culture and has helped the Meitei people strengthen their identity, especially in relation to Hindu culture. The festival and its traditions show the Meitei view of the world and their values. It also reflects their material culture.

A bonfire (Meji) is lit for the ceremonial conclusion and prayer to the God of Fire. The festival is developed by the Tibeto-Burman  cultures and festivals Magan of Kachari.

Overview (Rituals)
The festival is marked by feasts and bonfires. Young people erect makeshift huts, known as Meji and Bhelaghar, from bamboo, leaves and thatch, and in Bhelaghar they eat the food prepared for the feast, and then burn the huts the next morning. The celebrations also feature traditional Assamese games such as ‘’tekeli bhonga’’ (pot-breaking) and buffalo fighting.
Magh Bihu celebrations start on the last day of the previous month, the month of ""Pooh"", usually the 29th of Pooh is 14 January, and is the only day of Magh Bihu in modern times (earlier, the festival would last for the whole month of Magh, and so the name Magh Bihu). The night before is ""Uruka"" (28th of Pooh), when people gather around a bonfire, cook dinner, and make merry.
During Magh Bihu, people of Assam make rice cakes with various names such as Sunga Pitha, Til Pitha etc. and some other sweets of coconut called Laru.

Uruka or Bihu Eve (Beginning)
The first day of Magh Bihu is known as Uruka or the Bihu Eve. The word Uruka is originally derived from the Deori-Chutia word Urukuwa which means ""to end"", signifying the end of the harvesting season as well the Pausha month. On this day, women folk get ready for the next day with food items like- Chira, Pitha, Laru, Curd. A feast is organised at night known as Bhuj. Various indigenous communities prepare rice beer, which is usually not distilled. This is known as Chuji by the Chutias, Nam-Lao by Tai-Ahom, Zou by Bodos, and Aapong by the Mising. Uruka feasting may be a family affair or communal. After the feasting, the Uruka is over. Hut-like structures called Bhelaghar are also built in the fields where people stay during the night. More often village youth pass the night in the Bhelaghars warming themselves by the fire and making use of the vegetables that they steal from the backyards of villagers which is considered a tradition.

Day of Magh Bihu (celebration)
The day of the Bihu starts at early dawn by a post-harvesting ceremony called ""Meji"". In this, bonfires are burned in the fields and people pray to their ancestral gods for blessings. The word Meji is originally derived from either the Deori-Chutia word Midi-ye-ji where ""Midi"" denotes ""Ancestral gods"", ""Ye"" means ""Fire” and ""Ji"" means ""Fly away"" (signifying the worship of ancestral spirits which fly away with the fire), or the  Proto-Sino-tibetan word for “Fire” (Meij ( མེ in Tibetan, မီး in Burmese). The bonfires are usually made with fireword, green bamboo, hay and dried Banana leaves. People take bath before setting up the bonfire, as a tradition. The ritual of Meji Jwaluwa (Firing the Meji) is very enjoyable. Worshipping the Bhoral and Meji is done by offering Chicken, Rice cakes, Rice beers, Chira, Pitha, Akhoi, Horoom, Curd, and other eatables.
At the end, the Bhelaghar is also burned and people consume a special preparation known as Mah-Karai, which is a roasted mixture of rice, black gram. In the breakfast and lunch, people consume various traditional dishes like various Fish, Duck, Chicken and Mutton curries along with rice, ‘tenga’, ‘aloo pitika’ and ‘doi sira’. The ashes of the bonfire Meji and Bhelaghar are used in the trees and crops to increase the fertility of the gardens or fields.

Related Festivals
Along with the main Me-Ji and Sangken, there are many related festivals can be seen Assam and Arunachal. On the seventh day of Magh Bihu they clean utensils and sacrifice fowls to Bathou, their God and go out carol singing, collecting foods. They set up Bhelaghars and burn them in the morning.
In the Full moon day of Magh month, the Khamti people observe a similar Bonfire tradition related to Buddha. Given the fact that no other Tai group follows such ritual, it can be concluded it would be better  that the Khamtis merely adopted the ritual from the locals in the 18th century which was later developed into a Buddhist rite, similar to the Kechai-khati worship organised on the same day.

The rituals of the observance of Me Dam Me Phi are written in the book Khyek-lai or Lit Lai Me-Dam-Me-Phi in Tai Ahom language.   In other Tai groups distant ancestors are referred as'Phi-dam. The ancestor worship ceremonies are mainly divided into two categories: the domestic ancestor worship (Dam-phi) and the social festival (Me-dam-me-phi).

Origin
The Ahoms have their own tenets and faith. A very important part of this religion is ancestor worship.  Ancestor worship culture began with the Chinese philosopher Confucius still practiced among the Chinese and the Tai. From the Ahom Chronicle Pyen kaka it can be known that when Lengdon, the king of Mong Phi (The heavenly kingdom; Tian), sent two of his grandsons Khunlung and Khunlai to Mong Ri, present Xishuangbanna, China at that moment Ye-Cheng-Pha the ancestor literacist of knowledge advised them to perform Umpha, Phuralong, Mae Dam Mae Phi and Rik-khwan worships in different months of a year on different occasions to pay respect to the Phi-Dam (Ancestral Spirit) and Khwan elements in the month of Duen-Ha.

On the day of Me-Dam Me Phi worship is offered only to Chaufi and Dam Chaufi because they are regarded as gods of heaven. Changphi and Grihadam are not worshipped on that day because they are regarded as earthly gods.
The Ahoms believe that a man after his death remains as ‘Dam’(ancestor) only for a few days and soon he becomes ‘Phi’ (God). They also believe that the soul of a man which is immortal unites with the supreme soul, possesses the qualities of a spiritual being and always blesses the family. So every Ahom family in order to worship the dead establish a pillar on the opposite side of the kitchen (Barghar) which is called ‘Damkhuta’ where they worship the dead with various offerings like homemade wine, egg  with handoh(a kind of rice powder) with various items of vegetarian dishes.

Significance

Me Dam Me Phi and its significance
Me Dam Me Phi is one of the important festivals observed by the Ahoms from very ancient times. The word ‘Me’ means offerings. ‘Dam’ means ancestors and ‘Phi’ means gods. So the word ‘Me Dam Me Phi’ means oblations offered to the dead and sacrifices to gods. This festival is observed individually by a family and publicly by a king and the general people.

The Ahom kings performed this worship after victory in wars and to ward off any imminent danger of the State.
The Ahoms had their own tenets and faith. From the Ahom chronicles it can be known that when Lengdan, the God of heaven, sent two of his grandsons Khunlung and Khunlai to earth by a golden chain at that moment Gasingpha, the God of knowledge advised them to perform Umpha, Phuralong, Medam Me Phi and Rikhwan worships in different months of a year on different occasions. Since that day till now Me Dam Me Phi has been observed by all the Ahoms.

Rikhan is performed before going to war. It is believed that this worship gave long life to soldiers. They ( the soldiers) took bamboo made fish catching equipment and went to ""Borpukhuri"" (A large pond). Whatever they get during fishing like fishes, frog, aquatic animals, etc., they put them on cooking utensils Alive during cooking and Served soldiers. It is believed that this ritual gives longevity and they became undefeated.
When Me Dam Me Phi is observed publicly worship is offered in the name of three gods and they are Me Dam Me Phi, Dam Changphi and Grihadam. God Dam Chao Phi is associated with the belief of some natural powers like creation and destruction, water, lightning and storm, sun, moon, learning, diseases, earth, etc.

History and origin
Nomenclature
In Bengali, the word Pohela (or Pahela Bengali: পহেলা), alternatively Poila (Bengali: পয়লা), means 'first' and Boishakh (or Baishak Bengali: বৈশাখ) is the first month of the Bengali calendar (Bengali: পহেলা বৈশাখ Pohela Boishakh, Pahela Boishakh, Pahale Baishak or Bengali: পয়লা বৈশাখ Poila Boishakh).

Bengali New Year is referred to in Bengali as Nobo Borsho (Bengali: নববর্ষ), where 'Nobo' means new and 'Borsho' means year.

Traditional roots
Mughal origin theory
During Mughal rule, land taxes were collected from Bengali people according to the Islamic Hijri calendar. This calendar was a lunar calendar, and its new year did not coincide with the solar agricultural cycles. According to some sources, the festival was a tradition introduced in Bengal during the rule of Mughal Emperor Akbar to time the tax year to the harvest, and the Bangla year was therewith called Bangabda. Akbar asked the royal astronomer Fathullah Shirazi to create a new calendar by combining the lunar Islamic calendar and solar Hindu calendar already in use, and this was known as Fasholi shan (harvest calendar). According to some historians, this started the Bengali calendar. According to Shamsuzzaman Khan, it could be Nawab Murshid Quli Khan, a Mughal governor, who first used the tradition of Punyaho as ""a day for ceremonial land tax collection"", and used Akbar's fiscal policy to start the Bangla calendar.
According to Shamsuzzaman Khan, and Nitish Sengupta, the origin of the Bengali calendar is unclear. According to Shamsuzzaman, it is called Bangla shon or shaal, which are Arabic (سن) and Persian (سال) words respectively, suggests that it was introduced by a Muslim king or sultan."" In contrast, according to Sengupta, its traditional name is Bangabda. It is also unclear, whether it was adopted by Alauddin Husain Shah or Akbar. The tradition to use the Bengali calendar may have been started by Husain Shah before Akbar. Regardless of who adopted the Bengali calendar and the new year, states Sengupta, it helped collect land taxes after the spring harvest based on traditional Bengali calendar, because the Islamic Hijri calendar created administrative difficulties in setting the collection date.
Some say that the current Bengali Calendar begins from the year of Hijrah, i.e., migration of Prophet Muhammad, the last messenger in Islam, from Makkah to Madinah.
The festive celebrations of the Bengali New Year can be traced back to the Bengali Muslim fishmonger community of Mahifarash in Old Dhaka. During the Mughal period, the Mahifarash were known for organising feasts and banquets at their Azimpur grounds to mark the beginning of the cultivation harvest season. This day-long feast served as a precursor to what would later be evolved into the traditional Pohela Boishakh celebration.

Vikramaditya origin theory
Some historians attribute the Bengali calendar to the 7th-century Indian king Shashanka. The term Bangabda (Bangla year) is found too in two Shiva temples many centuries older than Akbar era, suggesting that Bengali calendar existed before Akbar's time. Various dynasties whose territories extended into Bengal, prior to the 13th-century, used the Vikrami calendar. Buddhist texts and inscriptions created in the Pala Empire era mention ""Vikrama"" and the months such as Ashvin, a system found in Sanskrit texts elsewhere in ancient and medieval Indian subcontinent.
In rural Bengali communities of India, the Bengali calendar is credited to ""Bikromaditto"", like many other parts of India and Nepal. However, unlike these regions where it starts in 57 BCE, the Bengali calendar starts from 593 CE suggesting that the starting reference year was adjusted at some point.

Contemporary usage
In Bangladesh however, the old Bengali calendar was modified in 1966 by a committee headed by Muhammad Shahidullah, making the first five months 31 days long, rest 30 days each, with the month of Falgun adjusted to 31 days in every leap year. This was officially adopted by Bangladesh in 1987. Since then, the national calendar starts with and the new year festival always falls on 14 April in Bangladesh. In 2018–19, the calendar was amended again, with Falgun now lasting 29 days in regular years and to 30 days in leap ones, in an effort to more align with Western use of the Gregorian calendar. However, the date of the celebration, 14 April, was retained.
The Bengali calendar in India remains tied to the Hindu calendar system and is used to set the various Bengali Hindu festivals. For Bengalis of West Bengal and other Indian states, the festival falls either on 14 or 15 April every year. The current Bengali calendar in use in the Indian states is based on the Sanskrit text Surya Siddhanta. It retains the historic Sanskrit names of the months, with the first month as Baishakh.

Drummers and dancers belonging to a village are invited to perform in the neighboring village. It is a festival of songs and dances.

Significance
Generally Miri youths, after harvesting the crops, observe this festival in order to appease the supposed Almighty, mother earth and their forefathers and seek blessings from them. Both young boys and girls in their traditional attire take part in singing and dancing. The songs are based on agriculture and the dances are typical imitation of the dance postures of the agricultural works.

Celebration
Arrangement
The youth organisation of the tribe arranges the festival in a formal and systematic manner called ""Daghik"". Officers are appointed as Migam Bora, Bar Puwary, etc. under whom there are some high and low officers, such as Deka Bora, Tiri Bora, Tamuli and Bar Barani, who assist them. In ancient times, a ""Miboo"" was appointed as leader for the functioning of the festival. Nowadays, he has been replaced by Migam Bora and Bar puwary.

Muroung
The ""Murong"" is the community hall of the Misings. At the beginning of the festival, the Morung is renovated by decorating the tie-beams and the posts. Nowadays, in some villages, the system of decorating them has changed and a new one is used.

Feast
A grand feast is arranged where at least four to five pigs are sacrificed. The host village invites neighboring villages to take part in the festival as Minams (guests). The Minams are cordially received and taken with Gumrag dance to the Morung. The festival ends with a prayer dance known as ""Ponu Nunam"".

Rasalila has also been a popular theme for other India classical dances including Bharatanatyam, Odissi, Manipuri Raas Leela, Kuchipudi, and Kathak.

The Indian classical dance of Kathak and Manipuri Raas leela are evolved from the rasalila of Braj. Kathak, also known as Natwari Nritya, was revived in the 1960s by the Kathak dancer, Uma Sharma.

Etymology
The term raslila is derived from the Sanskrit words ras which means ""nectar"", ""emotion"" or ""sweet taste"" and lila meaning ""act,"" ""play"" or ""dance."" Thus, it is more broadly defined as the ""Dance of Divine Love"" or ""Sweet act of Krishna.""

Legend
The Raslila takes place one night when the gopis of Vrindavana, upon hearing the sound of Krishna's flute, sneak away from their households and families to the forest to dance with Krishna throughout the night, which Krishna supernaturally stretches to the length of one kalpa, a Hindu unit of time lasting approximately 4.32 billion years. In the Krishna Bhakti traditions, the rasa-lila is considered to be one most beautiful depiction of soulful love. In these traditions, romantic love between human beings in the material world is seen as a reflection of the soul's original, ecstatic spiritual love of Krishna, in his spiritual world, Goloka.
In the Bhagavata Purana it is stated that whoever faithfully hears or describes the rasalila attains Krishna's pure loving devotion (Suddha-bhakti). The rasalila is considered to be the ""ultimate message"" of the Bhagavata Purana.: 1  The story starts in Vraja, where Krishna is inspired to play music on his flute. Hearing the music, the gopis leave their homes and families and make it to Krishna. When they came closer, Krishna playfully disappears and reappears. Krishna talks about love and performs rasalila with each of the gopis, assuming numerous forms. The story ends with the gopis reluctantly going back to their homes after refreshing in a nearby river.: 2 
Graham Schweig observes that a closer reading of the story leads one to see the story as a symbol of ""intense devotion to God"" and not a ""display of worldly lust"". Verse 10.33.40 of the Bhagavata states that, ""the person who has heard this story will attain high devotion to the Lord, and then, sobered, he will quickly throw off lust, the disease of the heart.""
Schweig argues for an appreciation of the ""unique vision"" presented in the text in which God is ""an adorable, eternally youthful cowherd boy who plays the flute and delights in amorous dalliance with his dearest devotees"".: 3  Schweig compares the rasalila to the ""Song of Songs"". He argues that just as the Song of Solomon has been ascribed the highest status in relation to other books of the Bible by mystics of the Jewish and Christian traditions, the rasalila has been considered by Vaishnava traditions to be the ""crown-jewel of all acts of God"".: 8 
Just as a child plays at its own will with its reflection in a mirror, with the help of his Yogamaya, Krishna sported with the gopis, who are regarded to have been shadows of his own form.

Performance
Rasalila has been a popular theme in Kathak, Bharatanatyam, Odissi, Manipuri, and Kuchipudi dance forms. Rasalila is a popular form of folk theatre in the regions of Mathura, Vrindavana in Uttar Pradesh, Nathdwara amongst various followers of Pushtimarg or the Vallabh sect and other sects in the regions of India. It is also seen in Gaudiya Vaishnavism in Nadia a district of West Bengal which is also known for Raas Utsava. Vanga Raas of Santipur is the main festival of this town, Nabadwip also has Shakta Raas.
The raslila is also observed as one of the State Festivals of Assam which usually is celebrated during late November or early December. During Raas Mahotsava, several thousand devotees visit the holy temples and satras of Assam every year. The Raas Mahotsav of Majuli, Nalbari and of Howly are noteworthy.

In the tradition of Vaishnavism of Manipur Raas Leela is depicted within Manipuri classical Indian dance and revolves around the story of love between Krishna and Radha, his divine beloved. This form of dance was started by Bhagya Chandra in 1779 and in some parts of India is still performed every year on Krishna Janmashtami (the festival to celebrate Krishna's birthday). According to different traditions, the rasa-lila is performed either by boys and girls, or by girls only. The dance is performed holding dandi (sticks) and is often accompanied with folk songs and devotional music.

The traditional rasalila performances in Vrindavan are famous throughout the Vaishnava world as an experience of the spiritual world. Rasalila performance was started by Swami Sri Uddhavaghamanda Devacharya in the early 15th Century CE at Vamshivata in Vrindavan, Mathura. He was a prominent saint of the Nimbarka Sampradaya, and disciple of the Swami Sri Harivyasa Devacharya. The Vani literature of Vraja is the transcription of the songs that were heard by Swami Harivyasa Devacarya and his Guru, Swami Shri Shribhatta as they meditated on the Nitya Lila of Radha Krishna. These songs describe the eternal spiritual abode of Radha Krishna, the Sakhis and Nitya Vrindavana Dham - or Nikunja Dham.  It became more prominent utsava in 16th and 17th century, when Mahaprabhu Shri Vallabhacharya and Vitthalanatha gusaiji made it more popular.

History
Regarding origin of the Sogra festival there are two different versions of a legend that are current among the Tiwa. According to a one version associated with Amsai village, this festival was introduced by an orphan boy named Majibor Sagra. According to the story, one day while Majibor was roaming around in the hills, he found some unusual white flowers which resemble snow. When the village elders came to know about the flowers, they thought, it was a gift from the god and decided to celebrate the finding as a religious festival. As the boy belonged to Sagra clan hence this festival was named after his clan. Another version of the story associated with the Marjong group tells that one day when Sharipahai, the supreme god was sitting in a meeting with other gods like Thalia,Thogriya and Palakhongor, a bunch of flowers fell from the sky. The flowers were very beautiful hence Thalia took them with him and gave it to the young boys of his village. The flowers fascinated the children who started dancing. Seeing their joyfulness the gods decided to commemorate the occasion by having a celebration. It may be noted that the Sogra festival is said to have been first held at Amsai.

The festival is also celebrated by the diaspora in countries such as the United States, Australia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, Mauritius, Japan, and the United Kingdom.
During Chhath Puja, prayers are dedicated to the solar deity, Surya: to express gratitude for the blessings of life on Earth and to seek the fulfilment of personal wishes.
Chhathi Maiya (or Chhathi Mata), the sixth form of Prakriti and Surya's sister, is worshipped during the festival. It is celebrated for six days after Deepavali, or Tihar, till the sixth day of the lunar month of Kartika (October or November) in the Hindu calendar (Vikram Samvat), which is why it is called Surya Shashti Vrata. The rituals are observed over three nights and four days. They include holy bathing, fasting, and abstaining from drinking water (as a vrata), standing in water, and offering prasada (prayer offerings) and arghya to the rising and setting of the Sun. Some devotees also perform a prostration march as they head towards the riverbanks. All devotees prepare similar prasada (religious food) and offerings.

Environmentalists have claimed that the festival of Chhath is one of the most eco-friendly religious festivals. Although the festival is observed most widely in Nepal and some Indian states, it is also prevalent in areas where the diaspora and migration from those areas have a presence.","Chhath is an ancient Hindu festival, native to eastern India and southern Nepal.

The festival is also celebrated by the diaspora in countries such as the United States, Australia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, Mauritius, Japan, and the United Kingdom.
During Chhath Puja, prayers are dedicated to the solar deity, Surya: to express gratitude for the blessings of life on Earth and to seek the fulfilment of personal wishes.
Chhathi Maiya (or Chhathi Mata), the sixth form of Prakriti and Surya's sister, is worshipped during the festival. It is celebrated for six days after Deepavali, or Tihar, till the sixth day of the lunar month of Kartika (October or November) in the Hindu calendar (Vikram Samvat), which is why it is called Surya Shashti Vrata. The rituals are observed over three nights and four days. They include holy bathing, fasting, and abstaining from drinking water (as a vrata), standing in water, and offering prasada (prayer offerings) and arghya to the rising and setting of the Sun. Some devotees also perform a prostration march as they head towards the riverbanks. All devotees prepare similar prasada (religious food) and offerings.

Environmentalists have claimed that the festival of Chhath is one of the most eco-friendly religious festivals. Although the festival is observed most widely in Nepal and some Indian states, it is also prevalent in areas where the diaspora and migration from those areas have a presence.

Significance
Chhath puja is dedicated to the Sun God Surya, as it is thought that the sun is visible to every being and is the basis of life of all creatures on Earth. Along with the Sun God, Chhathi Maiya is also worshipped on this day. According to Vedic astrology, Chhathi Maiya (or Chhathi Mata) grants children long life and good health by shielding them from illnesses and diseases.

Description
Chhath Puja is a folk festival that lasts four days. It starts with Kartik Shukla Chaturthi and ends with Kartik Shukla Saptami. Chhath is celebrated twice in a year.

Chaiti Chhath - It is observed in the Chaitra month of Vikram Samvat.
Kartik Chhath - It is celebrated at a very large scale in the Kartika month of Vikram Samvat.

Nahaay Khaay (Day 1)
This is the first day of Chhath Puja. The Parvaitin (transl. devotees, from Sanskrit parva, meaning ""occasion"" or ""festival"") must take a holy bath, after which the entire house, its surroundings, and pathways to the ghat are thoroughly cleaned. The Parvaitin usually cooks Sattvik Lauka Bhaat (bottle gourd and Bengal gram lentil preparation with Arva rice bhaat). This preparation is served to the deity in the afternoon as Bhog. This initiates the Parv (festival) and it is the last meal of the Parvaitin during Chhath Puja. The food is then eaten to protect the mind from thoughts of vengeance.

Rasiaav-Roti/Kharna/Lohanda (Day 2)
Kharna, also known as Rasiaav-Roti or Lohanda, is the second day of Chhath Puja. On this day, the devotees do not drink even a single drop of water as an offer to worship God. In the evening, they eat gur ke kheer (Kheer made up of jaggery), called Rasiaav, together with Roti.

Sandhya Arghya (Day 3)
This day is spent by preparing the prasada (offerings) at home, often consisting of a bamboo basket decorated with fruits, Thekua and rice laddus. On the evening of this day, the entire household accompanies the devotee to a riverbank, pond, or other large body of water to make the Arghya offerings to the setting sun. This occasion resembles a carnival in many ways. Besides the devotees and their friends and family, numerous participants and onlookers will help and receive the blessings of the worshipper.
At the time of arghya, Gangajal water is offered to Surya (Sun God) and the Chhathi Maiya is worshipped with the prasada. After the worship of Sun God, Chhath songs are sung in the night and the Vrat katha is read.
After returning home, the devotees perform the ritual of kosi bharai together with other family members. They take 5 to 7 sugarcanes and tie them together to form a Mandap and beneath the shade of that Mandap, 12 to 24 Diya lamps are burnt and thekua and other seasonal fruits are offered. The same ritual is repeated the next morning between 3 am and 4 am, and afterward, the devotees offer arghya or other offerings to the rising sun.

Usha Arghya (Day 4)
On the last day of Chhath Puja, at dawn, worshippers travel to the riverbank to offer an arghya to the rising sun. After making this holy offering, parents pray to Chhatti Maiya for their child's protection as well as the happiness and peace of their whole family. After worship, followers participate in the Paran or Parana rite, breaking their fast with a small amount of prasada and water. This rite emphasises the connection between family well-being and divine favours, serving as a symbol of thanksgiving and spiritual closure.

Rituals and traditions
The main worshippers, called parvaitin (from Sanskrit parv, meaning ""occasion"" or ""festival""), are usually women. However, men also observe this festival as Chhath is not a gender-specific festival. The parvaitin pray for the well-being of their family, and for the prosperity of their children.
In some communities, once a family member starts performing Chhath Puja, they are duty-bound to perform it every year and to pass it on to the following generations. The festival is skipped only if there is a death in the family that year. If the person stops performing the ritual on any particular year, it stops permanently and one cannot resume it. In other communities, this is not mandatory. The prasada offerings include Thekua, Khajuria, Tikri, Kasar and fruits (mainly sugar canes, sweet lime, coconut, banana and many seasonal fruits) offered in small bamboo baskets. The food is strictly vegetarian and is cooked without salt, onions or garlic. Emphasis is on maintaining the purity of the food.

History and associated legends
In Champaran, Bihar and Madhesh Province, Nepal, it is a belief that after leaving Ayodhya, Sita stayed in Valmiki Ashram located on the edge of Narayani River in Chitwan district. During that time she celebrated Chhath Mahaparva in Nepal. Even today, people celebrate Chhath festival with great pomp at Luv-Kush Ghat on the banks of Gandaki river located in Indo-Nepal border.
The Chhathi Maiya is worshipped on the Chhath festival, which is also mentioned in the Brahma Vaivarta Purana. It is said that the Chhath Puja was started in the holy city of Varanasi by Gahadavala dynasty. According to the Kashi Khanda, after Banaras the trend of Chhath Puja started increasing in the country.
It is also believed that, there was an ashram of the rishi Kashyapa and Aditi in the Buxar region. Mata Aditi gave birth to Surya as a son on the sixth day of Kartika. Surya is also called Aditya because he is the son of Aditi. For this reason, Chhath Puja is celebrated as the birth anniversary of Surya and the month of Kartika is considered a holy month throughout the year.
In Munger region, the festival is known for its association with Sita Manpatthar (Sita Charan; lit. Sita's footsteps). Sitacharan temple, situated on a boulder in the middle of the Ganges in Munger, is the main center of public faith regarding Chhath festival. It is believed that goddess Sita performed Chhath festival in Munger. That is why Chhath Mahaparva is celebrated with great pomp in Munger.
According to another legend, King Priyavrata, son of first Manu Svayambhu, was unhappy because he had no children. To remedy this, Kashyapa asked him to do a yajna. Shortly after, a son was born to Queen Malini; however, the baby was born dead. Following the stillbirth, the king and his family were heartbroken. Finding sympathy for the royal family, Mata Shashthi revealed herself in the sky. When the king prayed to her, she spoke, saying: ""I am Chhathi Maiya the sixth form of Prakriti. I protect all the children of the world and give the blessings of children to all childless parents."" After this, the goddess blessed the lifeless child with her hands, so that he came to life. The king was very thankful for the grace of the Goddess and he worshipped the goddess Shashthi Devi. It is believed that after this puja, this festival became a worldwide celebration.
Chhath has been mentioned in both the major Indian epics. In Ramayana, when Rama and Sita returned to Ayodhya, people celebrated Deepavali, and on its sixth day Ramarajya (lit. Kingdom of Rama) was established. On this day Rama and Sita fasted, and Surya Shashthi/Chhath Puja was performed by Sita. Hence, she was blessed with Lava and Kusha as sons. 
While in the Mahabharata, Chhath Puja was performed by Kunti after she (and the Pandavas) escaped from Lakshagriha. It is also believed that Karna, the son of Surya and Kunti, was conceived after Kunti performed Chhath Puja. Draupadi is also said to have performed the Puja for the Pandavas to win the Kurukshetra War. It is believed that Draupadi performed Chhath Puja near a spring in Nagdi village of Ranchi. In this village, Chhath Vratis neither offers Arghya in the river nor in the pond. Chhath Puja is performed near that spring in Nagdi.

Legend
According to a story, Jimutvahana was king of Gandharvas. He gave up his kingdom to his brothers and went to forest to serve his father. He married malayavati. Once he saw an old woman mourning. She told him that she belongs to the nagavamsha (family of snakes). Due to an oath she has to offer her only son Sankhchuda to Garuda tomorrow to feed. Jimutvahana promised to protect her only son. Next day he lay on a bed of rocks and offered himself to Garuda. Garuda came and attacked Jimutvahana with his claws. Jimutvahana stayed calm and then Garuda stopped attacking. Garuda inquired about his identity and then Jimutvahana narrated the entire story. Impressed by his kindness and benevolence, Garuda promised that he will not take any sacrifices from the nagavamsha. To cherish this legend mothers keep fast for the wellbeing of their children.
This story is similar to Nagananda (The Joy of the Snakes), a Sanskrit play written by Emperor Harsha in the 7th century CE where Vidyadara king  Jimutvahana sacrifices his life for Naga to Garuda. According to the story, Jimutaketu was king of snow clad mountain country of Vidyadhara. In his house, there was a heaven-sent wishing tree, the legecy of his forefathers. He had no son, so he asked the tree for a son. Then a child was born and he named him Jimutvahana. He was full of compassion for all living beings. He spoke to his father and asked the wishing tree to banish poverty and give wealth to men. Then the tree sent gold showers on the earth and all men rejoiced. The fame of Jimutvahana extended far and wide.
Even king Jimutaketu filled with hatred as the throne was firmly fixed by his son's glory. They wanted to seize the place where a wishing tree grows, bent on war. Then Jimutvahana gave up fighting for Thorne with relatives and left the forest with his father and mother for the Malaya mountains. This was the place of Siddha, the prince. He wished to marry his sister Malayavati with Jimutvahana and Jimutvahana married her. In the past life, Jimutvahana was Vidyadhara and Malayavati was his wife. Once he saw a woman crying. The son of women, Sankhchuda, tells him that they are Nagas and the serpent king sent him to the rock of death. Sankhachuda told him that the Garuda son of Vinata started to kill nagas after getting a nector from Vishnu, as in the past Kadru made Vinata a slave. Garuda started eating snakes. Then the king of Snakes, Vasuki, foresaw the destruction of serpents and made a pact with Garuda to send one snake each day. Jimutvahana placed himself on the rock of death. Then Garuda came and the earth began to tremble. Garuda bore Jimutvahana away with his beak and started to eat. Then rain of flowers started to fall from heaven. Garuda wondered after this incident and stopped eating Jimutvahana. Garuda tells Jimutvahana that he is not a snake but Jimutvahana tells him that he is a snake. Then Sankhachuda told him that he was a sanke and Jimutvahana was not. Garuda realised that Jimutvahana was not a snake but king of vidyadharas and filled with gulit. Jimutvahana told Garuda to not eat any snakes further. Then Garuda goes to bring the nectar from the heaven to heal the wounds of Jimutvahana and bring back the life of Snakes whose bones lies in rock. Then Guari came from heaven and sprinkled the nectar on the feet of Jimutvahana. The Garuda came and sprinkled the nectar and the snakes again became alive with clothes. Then all the snakes and the mother, father and wife of Jimutvahana came and praised him. Then Jimutvahana reigned Vidhyadhara.

The followers of Swami Satyananda Paramahansa, who believed him to be incarnation of god, started this event. Originally it was celebrated only for one day on Makar Sankranti festival.

Satyananda Sevashram Sangha
Sreemat Swami Satyananda Paramhansadeb  is the founder of Nara Narayan Sevasram and Satyananda Sevashram Sangha at Pakhanjore.
Swami Satyanand was born in Kalia, Faridpur District in Bangladesh (known as Bengal before partition of India). He had faith in god since childhood. He abandoned his family during his early youth and adopted the path of righteousness. Due to his propensity towards faith and his efficient preaching, a large number of students began to follow him. Swamiji's followers were from many parts of the country, and they started worshipping him as a messenger  of god.

First Ashram
Swami Satyananda sacrificed his home to build his first Ashram in Mathanbadhi at Bangladesh. While living with his disciple, he gave services to people for many years. After the 1947 partition of India Swami Satyananda along with his disciple came to India as refugees and settled at Paralkot (modern Pakhanjore). At Nara Narayan Sevsram in Pakhanjore he continued to serve people.

Swamiji's mausoleum
Swami Satyananda sacrificed his physical life and gave service to people, and he delivered the service through Nara Narayan Sevagram. The local people believed him to be an incarnation of god. In 1974 Swamiji abandoned the land and took mausoleum. Today his mausoleum is  the region's most magnificent temple. His divine body is placed in a special room below his statue.

First private higher secondary school
After the 1947 partition of India the people who came as refugees faced the biggest problem of the area: their children's education. Therefore, with the support of his disciples and Nara Nararyan Sevagram, Swami Satyananda established the first private higher secondary school for children of all religions. Registered in 1979, the school is now known as Satyananda Higher Secondary School.

Theme of Pakhanjore Mela
In year 2023 to make the mela more attractive a theme song was made by Prasenjit Haldar (Jeet)  .

The pilgrimage is similar to the traditional pilgrim fairs like those held in Haridwar and Prayagaraj. Like them, it's a kumbh, where devotees flock in to bathe en masse in sacred rivers to wash off their sins and attain redemption.
Rajim has long been a hotspot for the Vaishnavites. It is also a known Shaiva dharma centre. It was also a camping station on the pilgrimage route to other pilgrim centres in the vicinity. The ritual of Kalpwas is performed at Rajim just like it is at Allahabad. The religious congregation at Rajim performs a ceremony known as the 'fifth Kumbh' similar to the traditional 'Punni mela' observed every year at the famous Rajiv Lochan temple located near the holy confluence of the Mahanadi, Pairi and Sondur rivers in Rajim.
The Rajim Kumbh Mela is celebrated every year during February–March for about 15 days. The kumbh is attended by thousands of devotees and saints from various parts of India and abroad.

The Kumbh was brought to much spotlight with significant investment by the local government and especially by the efforts of the present state minister for Agriculture Shri Brijmohan Agrawal who have raised the stature of the kumbh in the country by personally investing in the fair and its infrastructure giving it a modern template without losing its Vedic spirit.","Rajim Kumbh Mela (Devanagari: राजिम कुम्भ मेला) is an annual Hindu pilgrimage held in Rajim, located in Gariaband district, Chhattisgarh, India.

History
Rajim Kumbh Mela has been celebrated as a proper kumbh since being brought forth into the limelight by the efforts of both the state and central government. Though significantly it is a huge Kumbh Mela and regarded as the ‘5’th Kumbh Mela, the Rajim Kumbh Mela missed the coverage and the limelight the major kumbh festivals have received.

Patrons of Rajim Kumbh Mela
Shri Brijmohan Agrawal is the minister for religious trust and endowments with varied portfolio in the government of Chhattisgarh. He has been influential in bringing the Rajim Kumbh Mela to the fore investing in the spiritual and financial aspects of the Kumbh. He is highly regarded as the guardian and whole soul of the Rajim Kumbh Mela by the locals as he with his fleet is a regular at the Kumbh and manages the daily affairs and management of the Kumbh.

He has been prompt in divesting the state government as well the centre to invest in the infrastructural development and sustenance of the Kumbh that it accommodate more pilgrims with better conveniences.

Mythology
There are many folklores associated with the Rajim Kumbh Mela with slight variations they all essentially points to a Vaishnavite significance of the place.
In some oral traditions, it is told that Lord Vishnu asked Lord Vishwakarma, the chief architect of the universe, to build for him a temple cum earthly abode at such a place upon the land where it has not been defiled by dead or burnt carcasses or incremation to a periphery of about 10 miles. Lord Vishwakarma scoured the planet in vain and returned vaikuntha empty-handed to which Lord Vishnu hurled a Lotus towards Earth and asked Lord Vishwakarma to erect a temple at the site where the flower kisses the ground. Thus a temple was built upon the nectars of the heavenly lotus known today as the Rajim Lochan temple, and the 5 petals eventuated the Panchkoshi Dhaam viz. Kuleshwarnath (Rajim), Champeshwarnath (Chamaranya), Bramhkeshwarnaath (Bramhani), Pandeshwarnath (Fingeshwar) and Kopeshwarnaath (Kopra).

Another legend is that King Ratnakar a very religious person who was a very pious person once, while performing a Yagya, was attacked by demons. They obstructed his ritual. Helpless and depressed King Ratnakar wailed and beckoned the gods. Meanwhile his royal elephant Gajendra was battling for life being caught by a croc named Grah. The elephant in grave pain, requested Lord Vishnu to help save him and it was then that Lord Vishnu came barefoot in rescue. After salvaging the helpless elephant, Lord Vishnu heard the plea of the king and appeared before him. He also blessed King Ratnakar and promised to stay in the earth as ‘Rajim Lochan’, where the pitcher fest started for being another abode of lord Venkateswara or Vishnu.

Rituals
Thousands of Naga Sadhus, Sants, Mahatmas, Rishis, Munis and Margdarshak Gurus come to Rajim Kumbh Mela each year for the festival. People start flocking to Rajim a day ahead of the festival, and take part in the special puja performed at midnight. Two temples that are prominently visited by the pilgrims during the kumbh are the Shri Kuleshwar Mahadev and Shri Rajiv Lochan.

Shahi snan in shahi kund
In the ghats of the Mahanadi that streams Rajim, the sadhus and other pilgrims take holy dips.

Holy bath in the Triveni Sangam
Devotees also take a holy bath in the Triveni Sangam, the confluence of the three rivers.

Shobha Yatra (rally)
Sobha yatras are daily carried out through the festival ground and the town, with devotees and sadhus carrying images of Lord Vishnu and occasionally of lord Shiva.

Archana
Daily archanas are conducted in various parts of the ghats and makeshift temples erected at the festival site, attended by thousands of locals and tourists.
In ‘Brahma Puranas’, 14 kinds of acts have been advised as unholy during ‘Kumbha-Parva’ such as having bath in river using soap, washing clothes, utensils in river water, throwing trash and excretion, etc. Those doing such things have been described as sinners; their sin considered to be as grave as slaughtering of cow.

It has been held since 1987.
It is organised by the Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC) in collaboration with the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, the National Horticultural Board and the New Delhi Municipal Council.  As in recent past years, the festival was held in the Talkatora Indoor Stadium.

A tourism official explained:  
More than 50 mango growers from across the country, mainly from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat and Delhi, were given an interactive platform to present the 'king of fruits' [...] The visitors, who normally think mango has just five or six varieties, were educated through quizzes and competitions about the huge variety of the fruit grown and innumerable possibilities of using mango in cuisine. They also enjoyed colourful entertainment programmes of music and dance. [...] It is an informal and international platform with a two-fold approach, to promote tourism as well as mango export.

More than 550 varieties and cultivars of mango are featured in the festival for visitors to view and taste.  Among these are alphonso, mallika, amrapali, himsagar, malda, balia, chorasya, dhaman, dhoon, fazia, gelchia, nigarin kheria, ruchika and shamasi.  Notable chefs from five star hotels like the Maurya Sheraton, Taj Mahal Palace & Tower, Inter-Continental Hotel, Marriott India, Qutub Hotel and Claridges around India demonstrate the preparation of assorted recipes made with mango.
The festival is also an opportunity for agro-industries and food industries processing mangoes into jams, pickles, fruit juice and canned fruit to display their products.

Activities in the festival include cultural programmes and recreational events like a mango eating competition for women, mango slogan writing, a demonstration of mango carving, a magic show, and a quiz about mangoes.  For the mango judging competition, there are various categories and a minimum of seven ripe mangoes are required for competing in each. There is also a prize given for biggest mango.

In describing International Mango Festival, a reporter for the BBC said: 
Some visitors found the culinary preparations - unusual in a country where the fruit is primarily eaten uncooked - interesting.  India exports about 40,000 metric tonnes of mangoes to 80 countries and the annual revenue earned from exporting mangoes and mango products reaches $85 million.  Festival organisers hope the event will help to raise these figures significantly.  Hindu mythology in India gives the mango an aura of mystique as a symbol of the joy of life.","The International Mango Festival, held annually in Delhi, India during early summer, is a two-day festival showcasing mangoes.

As in recent past years, the festival was held in the Talkatora Indoor Stadium.

A tourism official explained:  
More than 50 mango growers from across the country, mainly from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat and Delhi, were given an interactive platform to present the 'king of fruits' [...] The visitors, who normally think mango has just five or six varieties, were educated through quizzes and competitions about the huge variety of the fruit grown and innumerable possibilities of using mango in cuisine. They also enjoyed colourful entertainment programmes of music and dance. [...] It is an informal and international platform with a two-fold approach, to promote tourism as well as mango export.

More than 550 varieties and cultivars of mango are featured in the festival for visitors to view and taste.  Among these are alphonso, mallika, amrapali, himsagar, malda, balia, chorasya, dhaman, dhoon, fazia, gelchia, nigarin kheria, ruchika and shamasi.  Notable chefs from five star hotels like the Maurya Sheraton, Taj Mahal Palace & Tower, Inter-Continental Hotel, Marriott India, Qutub Hotel and Claridges around India demonstrate the preparation of assorted recipes made with mango.
The festival is also an opportunity for agro-industries and food industries processing mangoes into jams, pickles, fruit juice and canned fruit to display their products.

Activities in the festival include cultural programmes and recreational events like a mango eating competition for women, mango slogan writing, a demonstration of mango carving, a magic show, and a quiz about mangoes.  For the mango judging competition, there are various categories and a minimum of seven ripe mangoes are required for competing in each. There is also a prize given for biggest mango.

In describing International Mango Festival, a reporter for the BBC said: 
Some visitors found the culinary preparations - unusual in a country where the fruit is primarily eaten uncooked - interesting.  India exports about 40,000 metric tonnes of mangoes to 80 countries and the annual revenue earned from exporting mangoes and mango products reaches $85 million.  Festival organisers hope the event will help to raise these figures significantly.  Hindu mythology in India gives the mango an aura of mystique as a symbol of the joy of life.

Other festivals
Mango festivals are also held elsewhere in the world such as one hosted by Fairchild Tropical Gardens in Miami, Florida, United States, another in Cebu, Philippines and a third in Negril, Jamaica.

Critical views
Jashn-e-Rekhta received criticism from various corners due to its emphasis on Devanagari script and Roman script in expressing the Urdu literature. Rizwan Ahmad argued that ""The first few editions did not have the Jashn-e-Rekhta written in Urdu. Recent ones did include the Urdu script, but the schedules were available only in English. The big ‘I LOVE URDU’ cut-out where the youth were seen taking pictures was only in English. Both speak volumes about the targeted audience"".

Origin
The origin of Phool Waalon Ki Sair goes to 1812, during the reign of the Mughal King Akbar Shah II (r. 1808 -1837). Akbar Shah-II was not happy with his eldest son Siraj Uddin “Zafar” (Bahadur Shah Zafar II) and wanted to nominate his younger son Mirza Jahangir as the heir Apparent (Wali-Ahad). This move was not liked by the then British Resident in the Red Fort, Sir Archibald Seton. Once Mirza Jahangir who was a reckless youth of 19 insulted Seton in open court and called him Loolu. The British Resident somehow did not react to this insult as probably he did not understand the meaning of Loolu. After a few days, when Mirza Jahangir was merrymaking on the roof of Naubat Khana in Red Fort, Archibald Seton was coming from the Darbar after an audience with Resident. Mirza Jahangir fired a shot at the Resident from the roof of Naubat Khana. Seton escaped but his orderly was killed. For this act of his, Mirza Jahangir was exiled to Allahabad under orders of the British Resident.

The mother of Mirza Jahangir Queen Mumtaz Mahal Begum, was distraught and took a vow that if her son was released from Allahabad she would offer a chadar of flowers at the dargah of Khwaja Bakhtiar ‘Kaki’ at Mehrauli. After a couple of years, Mirza Jahangir was released and like a devout lady Mumtaz Mahal Begum went to Mehrauli to redeem her vow. With her, the Imperial Court also shifted to Mehrauli and so did the entire population of Delhi. For 7 days all sorts of merrymaking continued at Mehrauli with Jhoolas (swings) in the mango groves, cock fighting and bull baiting, kites flying, wrestling, and swimming bouts. Amidst all this merrymaking with great pomp and show, a chadar made of flowers was offered at the Dargah of Khwaja Bakhtiar Kaki. The Mughal king was secular-minded and under his orders floral offering in the shape of a floral pankha was offered at the famous Yogmaya Temple which is also in Mehrauli.
Seeing the response of the people and sensing the enthusiasm generated, it was decided that the festival will be held annually after the rains and people of all communities will offer pankha and chadar at the Dargah of Khwaja Bakhtiar Kaki and pankha and floral offering at Yogmayaji temple. The Darbar was also shifted to Mehrauli for the 7 days of the Festival. The Festival reached its pinnacle during the reign of Siraj-U-ddin ""Zafar"", the last Mughal emperor also known as Bahadur Shah “Zafar”. Bahadur Shah ""Zafar"" went to celebrate ""Phool Waalon Ki Sair"" even in 1857 when Delhi was under siege of the British. This was the last ""Phool Waalon Ki Sair"" under the Mughals.

Celebration
The people of Delhi carry flowers from the Chandni Chowk to Mehrauli-  to the shrine of Sufi saint Hazrat Qutubuddin Kaki and the Devi Jogmaya Mandir. The total distance of the Sair (walk) is about 32 km. One can read Delhi's soul in this journey of 32 km from Chandni Chowk to Mehrauli. Along the highway were scattered life-giving baolis and sarais to quench the thirst of travelers, built by kings and commoners.  Arab ki Sarai.. Qutub ki Sarai... Parsi temple ki sarai..Yogi ki Sarai..Sheikh ki Sarai...Badli-ki-Sarai..Katwaria Sarai etc. There used to be all-pervading ambience of fun and merriment what with qawwalis, and kathak being performed on the streets. Fire dancers also performed on the streets during the procession and added a mystic allure to the proceedings.
As it passed through the streets of Mehrauli, where the Mughal courts used to shift after the rainy season, Mughal Emperor, Akbar Shah II, used to enjoy the procession from the balcony of Zafar Mahal in Mehrauli and watched it move towards the shrine of Sufi Saint Qutbuddin Kaki and later to Yogmaya Temple

During British Raj
The Festival continued to be celebrated even after 1857 revolt by the British Deputy commissioner who was the highest government functionary in Delhi with the help of some prominent citizens. The Festival was stopped by the British during the Quit India Movement of Mahatma Gandhi in 1942 as part of their suppression of the movement.

Revival of the festival
In about 1961, the Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru attempted to revive the festival. He asked Noor Uddin Ahmed, the mayor of Delhi, Taimur Jahan Begum, scion of the Mughal dynasty and Yogeshwar Dayal, scion of a prominent Delhi family to revive the festival. ""Phool Waalon Ki Sair"" was revived in 1961-62, when Nehru joined the festivities on 6 September 1962 
Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru took great interest and came to Mehrauli on every ""Phool Waalon Ki Sair"" until his death in 1964. During the premiership of Indira Gandhi, all Indian states were requested to participate in the festival. 
Since its revival in 1962, the Festival is organized every year by the Anjuman Sair-e-Gul Faroshan, a society registered under the Societies Registration Act.

History
The Art of Living Foundation documents the first edition of the festival as 2006 in Bangalore. However, the event received little media attention compared to the 2011 and 2016 editions respectively.
In July 2011, the festival was organized at Berlin Olympic Stadium. Attendance were estimated at 60,000.
In 2016, the festival was held on the Yamuna floodplains in New Delhi from 11 to 13 March. It was organised by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar to celebrate the Art of Living Foundation's 35 years in service. Attendance was estimated at around 3.5 million people in audience and 37,000 artists over 3 days. The performances were held on a 100 feet tall by 1,200 feet wide stage with an area of seven acres. Around 1,700 officials were deployed for traffic management, during the festival, and around 300 were on standby for the other events (specifically marriages) to be held during the festival.

In 2016, the festival was chaired by Justice RC Lahoti. Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali from United Nations was also listed as a co-chair for the event but he died prior to the event. Some other committee members included former Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers; Nancy Pelosi, Katherine Clark and Ed Witfield from United States Congress; and former Lithuanian president Vytautas Landsbergis.
Following the 2016 edition, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull invited Art of Living Foundation to Australia for the next World Culture Festival.
In March 2023, AoL announced their next WFC event to be held in Washington, DC from 29 September to 1 October 2023.
By September 29, 2023, more than 600,000 people registered to attend at least one day of the event. WFC 2023 featured 17,000 performers from more than 100 countries and interviews with notable leading figures from various fields including former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who said he was introduced to Ravi Shankar through Vijay Nambiar, who worked as his former chief of staff. Jaime Aparicio attended the event and said he was inspired by Shankar's humanitarian and diplomatic efforts when he was one of the mediators to end the Colombian conflict in 2015. Another notable guest to the 2023 edition was former Slovenian Prime Minister Alojz Peterle, who performed playing the harmonica. Rabbi Sharon Cohen President of the Hebrew College spoke to the attendees at the event coinciding with the second day of the Jewish festival of Sukkot. Forrmer Tunisian president Moncef Marzouki attended the event and gave a speech. Conservative British politician Robert Buckland also gave a speech during the event. During the second day of the event, a Ukrainian heritage group composed of a hundred artists performed the Hopak, a Ukrainian folklore dance. Five Bulgarian folklore dance groups numbereing more than two hundred dancers performed in the event. Other notable figures who attended the 2023 edition include: Vivek Murthy, Muriel Bowser, President of Mauritius Prithvirajsing Roopun, S. Jaishankar, Ryzsard Czarnecki, Ramnath Kovind, and Tim Draper.

Notable guests and security concerns
The 2016 edition was attended by various global and local religious and political leaders. Participants included former French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, Nepalese Deputy Prime Minister Kamal Thapa, Vice-President of Suriname Ashwin Adhin and Karu Jayasuriya from the Sri Lankan Parliament. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was also in audience and compared the festival to a ""kumbh mela"" of art. Other Indian leaders including Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Devendra Fadnavis, Raman Singh and Manish Sisodia attended the event on 12 March 2016. The last day of the event was attended by many BJP leaders including Arun Jaitley, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Venkaiah Naidu, Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.
The event was also promoted as an interfaith meet and attended by religious leaders like Rev. Dr. Gerald L. Durley, Dr. Ahmad Badreddin Hassoun, Mufti Mohammed Saeed Khan, Shankaracharya Vasudevanand Saraswati among others.
President Pranab Mukherjee declined to attend the event after first accepting the invitation due to concerns about environment law violations. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe also pulled out of the event citing security and protocol issues. A separate enclosure had to be constructed for Narendra Modi also due to a security threat.

Local criticism, concern raised by the NGT, and plea to the Supreme Court
The festival was criticized in the Indian news media for environmental reasons. The foundation was involved in a legal battle with the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which allowed the festival to be held after paying a security deposit of ₹5 crore (US$570,000) in order to compensate for any possible damage. The Art of Living Foundation questioned the findings by the tribunal and has since then submitted a plea in the Supreme Court of India. Eventually it was found that the entire area where the event took place was successfully cleared without any damage and handed over to the respective authorities.

The ninth edition was co-curated by Damodar Mauzo and Vivek Menezes. It featured book releases like Sita Valles: Revolutionary Until Death by Frederick Noronha's Goa 1556.

Response
The online StageCulture.com said of GALF: ""Hosted annually in December, this Fest has proven beyond doubt, that Goa is much more than just a hip beach destination and rave hotspot.""
Skyscanner.co.in said: ""The Goa Arts and Literary festival ... is now in its fifth year, and is quickly establishing itself as one of the literary events of the year. In between attending literary events, readings and book launches, you’ll be able to visit the popular beaches of [G]oa for some sun, sand and seafood! ...Participation is free, with pre-registration.""
Writing in The Navhind Times, one critical point of view commented: ""Goa needs to create rooms of its own to spur on the creative process. But, now, just when writers from here have an enhanced chance of getting heard, we could be building new hierarchies. Local work needs to be validated by the tastes of someone in New Delhi or New York, before it can be deemed as significant and having value for Goa. This is a deeply disturbing idea, even if it is implemented subconsciously. There seems to be little consultation happening to source out potential participants. In the case of national and international participants, one can go by what is said about them, or reputations built in other literary festivals. How does one choose participation from Goa when we are still to understand the field of who’s doing what?""
Mridula Garg writes, ""Sometimes, in a blink of an eye, we discover that the someone we thought lay at the extreme end of the margin is actually closest to us; in fact is our alter ego... That is the point when we begin to create literature or art. That’s why a Damodar Mauzo can write about a Goan boy’s life in East Africa in the last century with the same ease he can write about Goa now. It’s important to remember that the margin is not a homogeneous space. Within the margin lie a number of invisible margins peopled with dissenters. And each of them is a significant other because dissent is the life-blood of literature and social change.""

Ayam nijam paroveti gananā laghuchetasām, Udāracharitānām tu vasudhaiva kutumbakam
(Extract from the Vedic scripture Maha Upanishad, meaning ""This is for me and that is for other – is the thinking of a narrow-minded person. For those who are broad-minded, liberals, or noble people, the entire world is one big family."")

History
First IFFI
The 1st edition of IFFI was organized by the Films Division, Government of India, with the patronage of the first Prime Minister of India. Held in Mumbai from 24 January to 1 February 1952, the Festival was subsequently taken to Madras, Delhi, Calcutta and Trivandrum. In all it had about 40 features and 100 short films. In Delhi, the IFFI was inaugurated by Prime Minister Pt Jawaharlal Nehru on 21 February 1952.
The first edition was non-competitive, and had 23 countries including the United States participating with 40 feature films and about a hundred short films. The Indian entries for the festival were Awara (Hindi), Pathala Bhairavi (Telugu), Amar Bhoopali (Marathi) and Babla (Bengali). This was the first International Film Festival held anywhere in Asia. The notable world panorama during the festival were Bicycle Thieves, Miracle in Milan, and Rome, Open City from Italy. Yukiwarisoo (Japan), The Dancing Fleese (UK), The River (US) and The Fall of Berlin (USSR).

Third IFFI
It was for the first time that the Indian Film Industry was exposed to a vast range of outstanding post-war era films. From the 3rd edition in January 1965, IFFI became competitive. It has since then moved to Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala. In 1975 the Filmotsav, non-competitive and to be held in other film-making cities in alternate years, was introduced. Later, Filmotsavs were merged into IFFI. In 2004 the IFFI was moved to Goa from Trivandrum. Since then IFFI has been an annual event and competitive.
The venue for the second festival held in 1961 which was also non-competitive was New Delhi. The third edition of the festival was chaired by Satyajit Ray. For the first time the festival became competitive, and was graded 'A' category by the Paris – based Federation International de Producers de Films. With this recognition the festival in India came on par with Cannes, Berlin, Venice, Karlovy Vary, and Moscow International film festivals.
Following this recognition, India adopted, at its fifth festival in 1975, a permanent insignia. This comprises a representation of the peacock, India's national bird, with a permanent motto of the festival 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' (The whole world is a family). The same year it was decided to hold a non-competitive festival of festival films (Filmotsav) alternating with IFFI. While the Filmotsavs were organized at major film – producing centres of India, IFFI was held in New Delhi only.
The venue being the same for all festivals, the fourth and fifth festivals were held from 5–18 December 1969 and 30 December 1974-12 January 1975 respectively. From the sixth festival onwards the period, as well as the dates for the festival, were fixed as 3–17 January every alternate year.

According to tradition, after attending Mass, young Goan Catholic men leap into and swim in local wells, streams, and ponds as a tribute to Saint John the Baptist.","San Juanv or São João is an annual Catholic religious festival celebrated on 24th June in Goa, India. According to tradition, after attending Mass, young Goan Catholic men leap into and swim in local wells, streams, and ponds as a tribute to Saint John the Baptist.

Background
The feast of São João is a celebration of the birth anniversary of Saint John the Baptist. Saint John was the son of Saint Elizabeth, a relative of Mary, mother of Jesus. One day, when Mary visited Elizabeth, the baby Saint John 'leapt' in her womb upon hearing Mary's greeting (Luke 1:44) When Jesus was thirty years old, he was baptised by Saint John in the Jordan River.
The Nativity of John the Baptist is known to be one of the oldest festivals of the Christian church, and records show that it was celebrated as a big feast in 506 AD.
The feast of São João in Goa coincides with the time of the year when the monsoon in Goa has usually commenced, there are fresh greenery and flowers in the surroundings, and wells and other water bodies are full. Consequently, the celebration of the birth of Saint John in Goa apparently evolved to incorporate elements of celebration of the rainy season. Jumping in wells and ponds is symbolic of the baby Saint John leaping in the womb, and of the baptism of Jesus in the river Jordan.

Observance and traditions
While the feast of São João is celebrated across the Catholic world on the same day, Goa is the only place in the world where it is marked by leaping into wells. On this day, groups of people go around singing traditional songs accompanied with instruments like ghumot, mhadalem, and kansallem. 
People wear kopels (transl. crowns) made of flowers and a creeper known locally as sanjuachi vaal (transl. creeper of São João). The creeper is found growing in wells during the early monsoons. It also has small red flowers that add to the beauty of the kopel. Some believe that the creeper was worn by Saint John himself.
Men also wear other adornments and vestments made from plant and other natural substances probably also a nod to the fact that Saint John wore natural coverings instead of clothing made of fabric.
While the general perception is that the festival is only celebrated by jumping into wells, Catholics also pray on this occasion for a good monsoon. In recent times, the festival has gained popularity among tourists. The festival has also been commercialized, with pool parties and resort celebrations included as part of celebrations.

While the São João celebrations are ""centuries old"", a more recent tradition is followed in the village of Siolim, in Bardez taluka, featuring colourful floats on boats. These festivities date back 175 years, when São João revellers from Chapora and Zhor villages of Anjuna, Badem in Assagao, and Siolim would come in boats to the chapel of São João in Pereira Vaddo, Siolim, every year, to pay homage to the saint.

In the village of Saligao, also in the Bardez taluka, the event is celebrated as the Vangodd de Saligao, a village festival of music, dance and with the villagers often cooking enough food to feed all the visitors free of cost.
São João is also a celebration of thanksgiving for newly-weds, and for families with babies born during the preceding year. It is thus referred to as Zanvoiamchem fest (transl. son-in-law's feast) locally. The newly married son-in-law is invited for lunch by his mother-in-law, following which the son-in-law is warmly welcomed with the bursting of firecrackers. Family members then sing the litany of all saints in Latin, followed by hymns dedicated to honour Saint John the Baptist, the Virgin Mary and other saints. As part of the celebratory lunch, dishes such as sanna (a steamed rice cake fermented with coconut palm toddy), verdur (pumpkin cooked in coconut milk, along with spices and shrimps) and pork vindaloo are prepared. Dessert includes patollyo (a dumpling stuffed with grated coconut and palm jaggery that is wrapped in fresh turmeric leaves). Following the meal, the family welcomes the village youth, who sing songs dedicated to Saint John and announce their arrival by hitting stumps of coconut palm on the ground. Later, in the evening, the son-in-law returns to his home with an ojem (transl. bamboo basket with gifts) gifted to him by his mother-in-law. This ojem is filled with fruits and sweets. Upon reaching his home, he places the ojem at the oratory of his house, following which everyone recites a short prayer and then distributes the contents of the ojem among his fellow villagers. This is meant to signify that a marriage is not just between two families but between two villages.
Traditionally, only male villagers would go around the village singing songs dedicated to Saint John. Announcing their arrival by hitting stumps of coconut palm on the ground, they would visit all the families in the village. They would wear colourful kopels and play traditional musical instruments like the ghumot and kansallem. People would thank them for visiting their houses by offering the boys alcohol, sannas, patollyo  and an assortment of fruits. At the end, the boys would assemble at the village cross and pray the litany honouring Saint John. The gifts that were offered by the families were then distributed among all the men. Following this, the men would jump into wells or lakes, despite the practice being discouraged by the Catholic Church.
Another tradition involves creating effigies of Judas or the Devil using dry materials like hay and paper and decorated using dry jackfruit or mango leaves. The effigy is carried by young boys to every house in the village and ultimately burnt to ashes outside the village cross or chapel.

bdff10ea-cab1-4a99-86fb-090f0266fb84,Shigmo,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigmo,Shigmo,"Shimgo, or Shishirotsava is a spring festival celebrated in the Indian state of Goa, where it is one of the major festivals of the Hindu community. It is also celebrated by Konkani diaspora and Indian festival of Holi is part of it.","Shimgo, or Shishirotsava is a spring festival celebrated in the Indian state of Goa, where it is one of the major festivals of the Hindu community. It is also celebrated by Konkani diaspora and Indian festival of Holi is part of it.

Etymology
The Konkani word śigmō comes from the Prakrit word suggimaho which in turn is derived from the Sanskrit word sugrīṣmaka.

Shigmo now
In recent years the state government has supported public Shigmo parades consisting of traditional folk and street dancers and elaborately built floats depicting scenes from regional mythology and religious scenes. Meanwhile, Shigmo festivals also continue in various rural parts of Goa, spanning over a fortnight, with different days earmarked for celebrations in different areas. This festival is celebrated around March each year. It is linked to the Hindu lunar calendar, hence its date according to the Gregorian calendar varies.

Variations
There are two variants of Shigmo festival: Dhakto Shigmo (""small Shigmo"") and Vhadlo Shigmo (""big Shigmo""). Dhakto Shigmo is generally celebrated by farmers, the labour class and the rural population, while Vhadlo Shigmo is of greater consequence and is celebrated by everyone together.

Timing
Dhakto Shigmo begins some five days before the full-moon day of the Indian lunar month of Phalguna and ends on the full-moon day in the Old Conquests areas of Goa (the areas that were under Portuguese colonial rule for a longer period of time, starting from the sixteenth century). On the other hand, Vhadlo Shigmo is mostly celebrated in the New Conquests areas, beginning on the full-moon day of Phalguna and continuing for five days.

Terminology
Naman are songs sung in chorus during the festival, when villagers assemble at a fixed place. Jot is another kind of song. Dances include Talgadi, Hanpet, Lamp Dance and Gopha. Dhol and Taso are drums, some of which can be huge, which people carry from door to door, dancing to their sound. Money is placed in a plate carried by the performers, in response to which they sing a song called the Tali, wishing the donor well. On the last day of the festival, it is believed that a spirit known as the Gade padap enters the dancers. Mand davarap refers to a collective bath taken after the festival comes to an end.

Folk songs and dances, temple festival
Dhakto Shigmo can be considered mainly as a festival of folk songs and folk dances, while Vhadlo Shigmo is considered a festival performed in the village temple. It is celebrated in different temples on different dates around the same period. On the first day, the village deity is bathed and dressed in saffron robes. After the offering of food, a feast is held. Shigmo celebrated in the temples of Jambavali, Phatarpya, Kansarpal and Dhargale are very famous in Goa and the neighboring states and attract a large number of devotees and tourists.
Eg folk songs like
शेवते झाडाचो लांबा ताळयो
लांब ताळयो शेवते फुला कळो

It is a week-long celebration that starts on the sixth day of the Shravana month of the Hindu calendar, usually in the month of July or August, that commemorates the belief that an epidemic in 1899 was overcome with the blessings of Lord Damodar, a local incarnation of Lord Shiva.","The Vasco Saptah (transl. week) or the Damodar Bhajani Saptah is an annual cultural and religious festival celebrated in Vasco da Gama, Goa. It is a week-long celebration that starts on the sixth day of the Shravana month of the Hindu calendar, usually in the month of July or August, that commemorates the belief that an epidemic in 1899 was overcome with the blessings of Lord Damodar, a local incarnation of Lord Shiva.

History
In 1899, an epidemic spread across the city of Vasco da Gama, Portuguese Goa, causing several deaths. Members of some prominent families from the city then travelled to Zambaulim to seek blessings from Lord Damodar (believed to be a local incarnation of Shiva) at Shri Damodar Sansthaan. The temple priest then gave them a shreephal (transl. sacred coconut) as prasada. The shreephal was then placed at the house of the Joshi family, and was worshipped faithfully by the citizens of Vasco, after which it is believed that the epidemic subsided. The Vasco Saptah (transl. week), or the Damodar Bhajani Saptah, is thus celebrated every year to commemorate this.

Observance and traditions
Shreephal ceremony
Every year on the sixth day of Shravana month of the Hindu calendar, usually in the month of July or August, a shreephal is brought from the Shri Damodar Sansthaan at Zambaulim and placed in the Damodar Temple at Vasco. The temple is located in the original large hall of the house that belongs to the Joshi family in Vasco. This ceremony, performed at noon, is accompanied with the singing of bhajans for 24 hours.
Since the Joshi family had originally housed the shreephal in 1899, a member of the family usually installs this sacred coconut every year. Until the 2000s, businessman and politician Vasant Joshi from the Joshi was responsible for this.

Cultural performances
The festivities in the city continue into the night. Paars, which are tableaux displaying stories from Hindu mythology, are paraded through the roads of Vasco. There also baithaks (entertainment sessions) featuring Indian classical songs held in various parts of Vasco.

Immersion of the shreephal
After the 24-hour celebration is completed, the shreephal is carried to the beach at Khariwada in Vasco and immersed into the sea.

Fair
During Saptah, a huge fair is held for about seven days in Vasco. This is an important shopping festival, selling items of necessity for the citizens of Vasco. Some examples of items sold include steel and brass utensils, grinding stones for spices, kitchenware and furniture. The fair also has people selling items of Chitari art. Other stalls sell local sweets such as kaddeo boddeo.

Local belief
Locals in Vasco believe that Lord Damodar has since protected the citizens from multiple epidemics in the city, including the 2006 chikungunya epidemic, the 2019 dengue epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic in India.

125th edition
The 125th edition of the festival was celebrated in 2024. It was marked by grand celebrations, unlike the smaller celebrations of the previous few years, due to the restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in India. The Saptah committee also released a special logo for the festival, that was available as souvenirs.

During the zatra, the idol(s) or murtis of the Hindu deity or deities are taken out on special procession either in a  ""Palkhi"" (sort of a Palanquin) or in a large, multi-storied chariot called the Rath.
Traditionally, every temple observes this festival once a year on the traditional day. All zatras usually occur after Diwali in October and continues until the Shigmo or Holi festival in March.
The most famous zatra of Goa is that of the temple of the Hindu deity Lairai at Shirgao, a place located roughly 30 km away from Panaji when people walk on burning coals with bare legs and that of deity Goddess Shantadurga at Village Fatorpa in Quepem Taluka; approx 50 km from Panaji and 18 km from Madgao. These Zatras can be compared to Mela (Hindi) for its other commercial and entertainment activities.

Popular snacks sold and consumed during  zatra are ladu which is the local name for laddu and khaje (खाजें) which are fried chickpea flour sticks dipped in a jaggery and sesame mixture.
Also occurring during the zatra is the phenomenon of possession, usually but not exclusively of women, by the spirit of the deity; this is called Bhar, whereby they act as oracles and claim to predict future events.
Outside of Goa, the most famous zatra is the Rath Yatra of the Jagannath Temple in Puri, Odisha, India which contributed the word juggernaut to the English language.","Zatra(जात्रा) is the Konkani language term for the pilgrimage festivals celebrated at Hindu temples in Goa, India; the equivalent of yatra and jatra.

During the zatra, the idol(s) or murtis of the Hindu deity or deities are taken out on special procession either in a  ""Palkhi"" (sort of a Palanquin) or in a large, multi-storied chariot called the Rath.
Traditionally, every temple observes this festival once a year on the traditional day. All zatras usually occur after Diwali in October and continues until the Shigmo or Holi festival in March.
The most famous zatra of Goa is that of the temple of the Hindu deity Lairai at Shirgao, a place located roughly 30 km away from Panaji when people walk on burning coals with bare legs and that of deity Goddess Shantadurga at Village Fatorpa in Quepem Taluka; approx 50 km from Panaji and 18 km from Madgao. These Zatras can be compared to Mela (Hindi) for its other commercial and entertainment activities.

Popular snacks sold and consumed during  zatra are ladu which is the local name for laddu and khaje (खाजें) which are fried chickpea flour sticks dipped in a jaggery and sesame mixture.
Also occurring during the zatra is the phenomenon of possession, usually but not exclusively of women, by the spirit of the deity; this is called Bhar, whereby they act as oracles and claim to predict future events.

In 2012, the Tourism Corporation of Gujarat mentioned that the International Kite Festival in Gujarat was attempting to enter the Guinness World Records book due to the participation of 42 countries in it that year.

Location
The International Kite Festival, Uttarayan, is celebrated in many cities of Gujarat, Telangana and Rajasthan including Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Udaipur, Jodhpur, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, Hyderabad, Nadiad, and Dakor. However, the international kite event takes place in Ahmedabad (kite capital of Gujarat), which accommodates visitors from many nations.
The best place to enjoy this festival is the Sabarmati Riverfront (its Sabarmati river bank has a capacity of over 500,000 people) or the Ahmedabad Police Stadium, where people lie down to see the sky filled with thousands of kites.
During the festival week the markets are flooded with kite buyers and sellers. In the heart of Ahmedabad is one of the most famous kite markets, Patang Bazaar, which during the festive week is open 24 hours a day with buyers and sellers negotiating and buying in bulk.
Many families in Ahmadabad start making kites at home and set up small shops in their own homes.
There is a Kite Museum located at Sanskar Kendra in Paldi area of Ahmedabad. Established in 1985, it contains a collection of unique kites.
Other parts of India also celebrate the kite festival, in Delhi on 15 August and in most of Bihar's districts on 14 April. People offer prayers and eat sattu (made from new crop wheat) and new mangoes (baby mango, also known as Tikola).

Dates
The festival takes place on 14 January of each year during the Makar Sankranti and continues until 15 January. This date marks the end of winter and the return of more clement weather for farmers of the Gujarat region. These days have also become a public holiday within the Gujarat state of India so that everyone can take part in the celebration. 15 January is known as Vasi Uttarayan.

History
The symbolism of this festival is to show the awakening of the gods from their deep sleep. Through India's history, it is said that India created the tradition of kite flying due to the kings and royals, later followed by nawabs, who found the sport entertaining, and as a way to display their skills and power. Over time, as the sport became popular, it began to reach the masses. Kite flying has been a regional event in Gujarat for several years. However, the first international festival was celebrated in 1989 when people from all across the globe participated and showcased their innovative kites.
In the 2012 event, the International Kite Festival was inaugurated by Chief Minister Narendra Modi in the presence of Governor Kamla Beniwal.

Participants
The mention of this festival is in the Rigveda which dates back more than 5000 years. The day marks the beginning of the auspicious six-month period known as Uttarayana. Today, regardless of people's background or beliefs, they are welcome to fly kites with everyone else in Gujarat in January. Most visitors arrive from around India, from Gujarat itself or another state. In major cities of Gujarat, kite flying starts as early as 5 am and goes until late at night. Approximately 8-10 million people participate in the festival.
However, many visitors come from around the world, from countries including Japan, Italy, UK, Canada, Brazil, Indonesia, Australia, the US, Malaysia, Singapore, France, and China to take part in the celebration.
The festival has been strongly influenced by its international participants in recent events, for instance:

Malaysia brought wau-balang kites.
Indonesia brought llayang-llayanghave.
The US brought giant banner kites.
Japan brought Rokkaku fighting kites.
Italy brought Italian sculptural kites.
Chinese brought flying dragon kites.
For other kites, see list of Kite types.
This festival is also an occasion for many public entities such as famous dancers, singers, actors, celebrities or politicians who make an appearance and entertain the population. In 2004, for example, the (Bollywood) actress Juhi Chawla was part of the celebration and performed a garba dance, which is very popular in India.

Types of kites
During the event, kite markets are set up alongside food stalls and performers. They are usually made with materials such as plastic, leaves, wood, metal, nylon and other scrap materials, but the ones for Uttarayan are made of light-weight paper and bamboo, and are mostly rhombus shaped with a central spine and a single bow. Dye and paint are also added to increase the glamour of the kite. The lines are covered with mixtures of glue and ground glass which, when dried, rolled up and attached to the rear, also known as firkees, become sharp enough to cut skin. These types of sharp lines are used on fighter kites, known in India as patangs, to cut down other kites during kite fighting events.
On the second night of the festival, illuminated kites filled with lights and candles known as tukals or tukkals are launched, creating a spectacle in the dark sky.

Other kite festivals

Kites are a part of the culture in Asia, which is why most kite festivals take place there. Here are the most popular kite festivals of the world:

Japan Kite Festival in Uchinada, Ishikawa
China Kite Festival called Weifang International Kite Festival

History of kullu dussehra
According legend, after this return from a pilgrimage to Maharishi Jamdagni went to his hermitage at Malana. On his head he carried a basket filled with eighteen images of different gods. Crossing through Chanderkhani pass, he came upon a fierce storm. Struggling to stay on his feet, Maharishi Jamdagni's basket was thrown from his head, scattering the images to many distant places. Hill people, finding these images saw them take shape or form as Gods, and began to worship them. Legend has it that deity worship began in the Kullu Valley.
Raja Jagat Singh ruled over the prosperous and beautiful kingdom of Kullu. As the ruler, the Raja learned of a peasant by the name of Durgadatta who apparently possessed many beautiful pearls. The Raja thought he should have these treasured pearls, even though the only pearls Durgadatta had were pearls of Knowledge. But the Raja in his greed ordered Durgadatta to hand over his pearls or be hanged. Knowing of his inevitable fate at the hands of the king, Durgadatta threw himself on the fire and cursed the king, ""Whenever you eat, your rice will appear as worms, and water will appear as blood"". Doomed by his fate, the Raja sought solace and searched out advice from a Ramanandi saint Krishnadas Payahari who belonged to Dahima/Dadhich Brahmin family. Shri Krishnadas Payahari told him that in order to eradicate the curse, he must retrieve the deity of Ragunath from Ram's kingdom. Desperate, the king sent a Brahmin to Ayodhya. Later the Brahmin stole the deity and set out on his journey back to Kullu. The people of Ayodhya, finding their beloved Ragunath missing, set out in search of the Kullu Brahmin. On the banks of the Saryu river, they approached the Brahmin and asked him why he had taken Ragunath ji. The Brahmin recounted the story of the Kullu king. The people of Ayodhya attempted to lift Ragunath, but their deity became incredibly heavy when headed back towards Ayodhya, and became very light when headed to Kullu. On reaching Kullu Ragunath was installed as the reigning deity of the Kullu kingdom. After installing the deity of Raghunath, Raja Jagat Singh drank the Charan-Amrit of the deity and the curse was lifted. Jagat Singh became Lord Ragunath's regent. This legend is connected with the Dussehra at Kullu. This deity is taken in a Ratha to the Dussehra. It started in 1606 and continues till now.

Mandi town located on the banks of the Beas River, popularly known as the ""cathedral of temples"", is one of the oldest towns of Himachal Pradesh with about 81 temples of different Gods and Goddesses in its periphery. There are several legends linked to the celebration of this event. The festival is centered on the protector deity of Mandi ""Mado Rai"" (Lord Vishnu) and Lord Shiva of the Bhootnath temple in Mandi.

History
Mandi town, where the festival is held, was ruled by Raja Ajbar Sen who was considered the first great ruler of Mandi State in the sixteenth century, since he not only combined the hereditary regions but also added to it by conquering new areas. Apart from his palace, he built the temple of Bhootnath (temple for Shiva) at the centre of the Mandi town, which is one of the two focal temples of the festival.
In the theocratic state that evolved during this period, worship of Lord Shiva and related Goddesses was dominant. However, the theocratic nature of the state received special emphasis when, during Raja Suraj Sen’s reign, Lord Vishnu worship also became integral to the State. Raja Suraj Sen (1664 to 1679), who did not have an heir, built the temple known as ""Madhav Rai temple"", dedicated to a form of Lord Vishnu, as protector of Mandi. An elegant silver image of Radha and Lord Krishna was made by his goldsmith Bhima, in the year 1705, which was named ""Madho Rai"" and deified, and ordained as the King of the State of Mandi thereafter. Since then the rulers served the state as servants of Madho Rai and custodians of the State. Suraj Sen’s successors have also held the deity of the temple in great reverence. This God is represented with precedence over all other gods on various religious occasions. The theocratic nature of the people of the state is amply reflected during the popular ""Mandi Maha Shivaratri Fair"", which is held every year with great fanfare.
However, the specific observance of this festival as a fair, starting with Shivaratri, is linked to its ruler Ishwari Sen. Ishawri Sen was held a prisoner for 12 years after he lost his kingdom in the war waged by Sansar Chand of Punjab, in 1792. He was released by the Gurkha invaders who had invaded the Kangra and Mandi states. Afterwards, the Gurkhas' restored the Mandi state to Ishwari Sen. He was given a reception on the occasion of his return to Mandi, his state capital. On this occasion, the King invited all hill deities of the Kingdom and held a grand celebration, and this day happened to be the Maha Shivratri festival day. Since then the practice of holding the Mandi fair during Shivaratri has been observed every year at Mandi. In recent years, modernity has also set in with Bollywood artists performing at the fair at Paddal in the celebrations in the evenings.

Observance
The observance of the fair is marked on the Maha Shivaratri day when the village gods are carried in palanquins or rathas (chariots by people) to Mandi to pay homage to Madho Rai and the Raja. Members of caste denominations such as Brahmin and Kshatriya carry their Gods and Goddesses by palanquins or on their back. However, some exceptions of carrying them in vehicles by some caste groups have been noted. Thereafter, the fair lasts for seven days.
It is an accepted practice that every deity that is brought to the festival (decorated with glittering embroidered drapery) visits Madho Rai temple first to pay obeisance to Lord Vishnu and then proceed to the palace in a colourful procession called the Shoba Yatra, known locally as 'Zareb,' to honour the ruler (the regent of the Lord Mado Rai). (It is said that Madho Rai comes out of his temple only once a year on the Shivaratri day and leads the procession.). The ruler thereafter pay obeisance to Lord Shiva at the Bhootnath temple where the main festival of Maha Shivaratri is held. The palanquins of the deities are swayed to the drum beats and folk music to indicate their happiness after visiting the temples of Vishnu and Shiva.
There is pecking order that is maintained in the sequence of worship by the deities invited to the fair, based on rank and status. The day after the Maha Shivaratri, on the second day of the fair, a pageant of gods with folk bands, dancers and devotees (all dressed in their colourful attire) and with lot of fanfare, is held in Paddal, a large open ground at the confluence of the Beas and Suketi rivers. Some 200 deities arrive from shrines around Mandi town and are assigned places at the Paddal grounds as per the pecking order, where the devotees offer worship to all the deities. The pageant is held every day of the festival.
The fair is also an occasion when local traders and people carry out brisk trade in local products such as wool, opium, honey, walnut, ghee (butter oil), and general merchandise from the region of Kangra, Kullu, Shimla, Bilaspur and from the neighbouring state of Punjab. It is said that the festivities promote handcrafted jewellery of the region. However, during the entire Mandi Shivaratri Fair, religiosity is the main theme. It is said that religious synthesis was achieved by combining the worship of Vishnu and Shiva cults during the seven-day fair.
One day before the concluding day of the festival at the end of fanfare, music and dance, in the evening, Jagaran (""night vigil,"" a nightlong worship) is held. On this occasion, a guru and his disciple proclaim prophesies for the following year. On the last day of the festivities, prayers are chanted and, after paying obeisance to Lord Shiva, all the deities assembled in Mandi depart to their original abodes. On this occasion, chadars (a form of devotional drapery offering to the god) are offered. It is an occasion when the head of the state (now a governor) is normally present on the last day, joins the worship, and accompanies the pageant. During all these festivities, it is said that Rishi Kamru Nag (local god of rains), the presiding deity of the Maha Shivaratri, after paying his obeisance to Madho Rai, moves to the Tarna ma temple at the top of the Tarna hill from where he watches the proceedings of the fair for seven days. 
People from all walks of life and belonging to all strata of the society from adjoining areas come to visit this fair and to  seek the blessings of Lord Shiva on this auspicious day. 

Bhootnath Temple
Bhootnath Temple, with an idol of a manifestation of Lord Shiva, an ancient temple dated to the 1520s, is synonymous with Mandi. It is in the heart of the town. The Nandi, Lord Shiva's mount,  faces the deity from the ornamented double-arched entrance. The festival of Maha Shivaratri is the prime event at this temple; the temple is the focal point of the seven day festival.
A legend is told of the building of Bhoothnath Temple. It is said that, in 1526, Raja Ajber Sen heard the story of a cow offering milk on her own volition to a particular stone in a forest in Mandi. Lord Shiva is said to have appeared in the Raja’s dream and directed him to extricate the Shiva Linga that was buried at that site. Thereafter, the Raja found the Shiva Linga at the indicated location, which he deified in a temple that he erected in 1526, at the place it was found. He called it the ""Bhootnath Temple"" and started the observance of the Shivaratri festival at Mandi. Concurrent with this event, the Raja shifted his capital from Bhiuli to Mandi.

The procession is led by a decorated chariot, accompanied by folk dancers, musicians, and devotees dressed in traditional attire. People from nearby villages and towns join the procession, adding to the festive atmosphere.

History
The history of Minjar Mela dates back several centuries and is closely associated with the town of Chamba in Himachal Pradesh, India. The festival's origin can be traced to the reign of Raja Sahil Varman, the founder of the Chamba dynasty, who ruled the region in the 10th century. According to the legend, Raja Sahil Varman was suffering from a severe illness, and the entire kingdom was in distress. The royal astrologers advised him to offer prayers to Lord Vishnu and seek his blessings for a speedy recovery. The king followed their advice and offered prayers and a golden umbrella (Minjar) at the temple of Lakshmi Narayan, seeking divine intervention.
Legend has it that the king's health miraculously improved, and the kingdom was saved from the crisis. In gratitude, the king initiated the tradition of Minjar Mela as a way to express his gratitude and seek blessings for prosperity and good fortune for the kingdom. Over time, the festival gained popularity and became an integral part of the local culture. The Minjar Mela is celebrated to commemorate the successful harvest of maize, which is a major crop in the region. The golden silk tassels (minjars) offered during the festival represent the abundance and prosperity associated with the harvest.
The festival served as a platform for the king to interact with his subjects, address their concerns, and strengthen the bond between the ruler and the ruled. Throughout the centuries, the Minjar Mela has evolved and adapted to changing times. It has incorporated various cultural elements, including folk dances, music, and traditional arts and crafts. Today, the Minjar Mela serves as a reminder of the historical and cultural legacy of the Chamba dynasty and the significance of agriculture in the lives of the local communities.
During the Minjar Mela, people offer prayers at the Lakshmi Narayan Temple in Chamba. The temple is beautifully adorned with flowers, and devotees make offerings of minjar, which are silk tassels representing the golden maize silk. These minjars are considered auspicious and are exchanged among friends and family as a symbol of good luck. PM Modi urges people to visit fairs across country, upload pictures on social media. The fairgrounds are filled with various stalls selling traditional handicrafts, local cuisine, and other items. Cultural performances, including folk dances, music, and theater, are organized throughout the week, providing visitors with a glimpse into the rich cultural heritage of the region.
Minjar Mela is not only a religious and cultural event but also a time for social gatherings and festivities. It brings together people from different communities and backgrounds.

The fair is celebrated a day after Diwali in Halog, the erstwhile capital of the princely state, along with members of the Jamog, a neighboring village.

History
The exact date or year of the fair's origin is unknown. The locals believe that the fair goes back a few centuries. Some sources say that the festival originated in the early 18th century when human sacrifice was common in the worship of goddess Kali. The practice was stopped in the later years when a queen of the Rana family of the Dhami kingdom committed sati to prevent human sacrifice and instead asked for the two warring groups to pelt stones at each other, and the blood of the wounded person was to be applied as tilak to the goddess' idol as a symbol of sacrifice.
As per another legend, a girl from the Halog village was engaged to be married to the prince of the Rangoli state but the residents of the Jamog village poisoned the prince right before the wedding was to be solemnized. The girl jumped on the funeral pyre of the prince and committed sati.

Rituals
The fair and festival begins a day after Diwali. Two teams are created: one team consists of the Halogis and clan members from Tundu, Dhagoi, and Katedu, and the second team consists of the Jamogis. Only the village warriors, known as Khunds, and the members of the royal family can participate in the rituals. From the temple seat of god Narsingh located within the Dhami palace, the Halogis take out a procession along with the Jamogis and proceed towards the temple grounds of goddess Kali where the queen is believed to have had committed sati. It is here that both the warrior groups symbolically shower stones at each other from a distance of 160 to 200 meters. The duration could be from a couple of minutes to an hour. Members of the royal family pelt the first stone after completing puja at the temple and it stops only when a person starts bleeding. The blood from the injured person is used to apply tilak on the idol of the goddess. People from Shimla and adjoining villages come to watch the rituals.
Women are allowed to participate as spectators only. Local police and doctors are available in modern times to manage the crowd and treat the injured. The royal family of Dhami, along with local members, continues to oversee and organize the fair and its traditions through their local committee.

Fair
Apart from the traditional fair customs and rituals, exhibition of farming equipment and artefacts are also organized during the time to give a boost to the local economy and improve the livelihood of local potters, artisans, and farmers.
For the first time in almost 250 years, the Sati Pradha Mela was paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. All rituals, possessions, gatherings, and exhibitions were brought to a halt.

The festival mostly observed in the state of Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam, and celebrated annually as per Hindu calendar in the month of Amavashya of Kartik.

Overview
Bandna is a celebration of the paddy seeds that are sown by the region's agrarian communities. This festival is celebrated by the cultivator communities like Bagal, Rajuar, Kumhar, Bauri, Bagdi, Yadav, Kurmi, Kalwar, Ahir, Koiri, Gorai and several other communities of East India. It is one of many Indian festivals during which cattle are worshiped.

Celebration
Bandna is a seven-day festival: the first three days are Chumaan; the fourth day is Goth Puja; the fifth day is Goriyaa Puja; the sixth day is Borod Khuntaan; and the seventh day is Budhi Bandna. The rituals of the first three days are sometimes extended to five days prior to Goth Puja.

Myth
Lord Shiva (Burha Baba) created men, he provided them with food. In due course, they multiplied into a sizeable population. Shiva advised them to produce their own food by cultivating the land. However, without agricultural implements and technology, farmers had many problems. They beseeched the lord for a solution. Shiva took pity on them and provided them with cattle. Initially, the relationship between the men and the cattle was cordial, but over time, it worsened and the cattle were abused. The cattle complained to Shiva. The complaint encompassed strenuous work, extended work hours, inadequate food, unhygienic shelters, beatings, lack of recreation and ingratitude towards their contribution. The lord assured them that he would inspect secretly on the night of Kartik Amavasya. The men became aware of the complaints, to the people cleaned their houses and cowsheds, and on the day of Amavasya, the cattle were properly washed while their horns and foreheads were smeared with oil and vermilion. The cattle were provided with fodder and the Gohal (cowshed) was illuminated with Diyas (earthen lamps). Bundles of grass were put along with Diyas on both sides of the entrance of the cowshed. Sohrai grass was placed on the roof to signify the availability of food for the cattle. On the second day, Shiva found the people worshiping Garaiya with special offerings, including a sacrifice made in their honour. On the third day, he observed that the cattle were in a merry mood, dancing with the people. The songs and the music filled the air with warmth, enthusiasm and harmony. On his way back, he found the Bagals/Dhangars (contractual header) playing with the cattle at the gochar (grazing land). This made the complaint invalid. The next season, the cattle complained again about hardships, prompting Shiva to inspect them on the same day. The lord made a secret visit, finding the cattle happy and content. Since then, the tradition continued and is annually celebrated as Bandna Parab.

bf988d02-cf8d-4baa-828a-2622d257dda4,Diwali,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali,Diwali,"Diwali (English:  ), also called Deepavali (IAST: Dīpāvalī) or Deepawali (IAST: Dīpāwalī), is the Hindu festival of lights, with variations celebrated in other Indian religions such as Jainism and Sikhism. It symbolises the spiritual victory of Dharma over Adharma, light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. Diwali is celebrated during the Hindu lunisolar months of Ashvin (according to the amanta tradition) and Kārtika—between around mid-September and mid-November. The celebrations generally last five or six days.
Diwali is connected to various religious events, deities and personalities, such as being the day Rama returned to his kingdom in Ayodhya with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana after defeating the demon king Ravana. It is also widely associated with Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity, and Ganesha, the god of wisdom and the remover of obstacles. Other regional traditions connect the holiday to Vishnu, Krishna, Durga, Shiva, Kali, Hanuman, Kubera, Yama, Yami, Dhanvantari, or Vishvakarman.
Primarily a Hindu festival, variations of Diwali are also celebrated by adherents of other faiths. The Jains observe their own Diwali which marks the final liberation of Mahavira. The Sikhs celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas to mark the release of Guru Hargobind from a Mughal prison. Newar Buddhists, unlike other Buddhists, celebrate Diwali by worshipping Lakshmi, while the Hindus of Eastern India and Bangladesh generally, celebrate Diwali by worshipping the goddess Kali.
During the festival, the celebrants illuminate their homes, temples and workspaces with diyas (oil lamps), candles and lanterns. Hindus, in particular, have a ritual oil bath at dawn on each day of the festival. Diwali is also marked with fireworks as well as the decoration of floors with rangoli designs and other parts of the house with jhalars. Food is a major focus with families partaking in feasts and sharing mithai. The festival is an annual homecoming and bonding period not only for families, but also for communities and associations, particularly those in urban areas, which will organise activities, events, and gatherings. Many towns organise community parades and fairs with parades or music and dance performances in parks. Some Hindus, Jains, and Sikhs will send Diwali greeting cards to family near and far during the festive season, occasionally with boxes of Indian confectionery. Another aspect of the festival is remembering the ancestors.
Diwali is also a major cultural event for the Hindu, Sikh, and Jain diaspora.

Etymology
Diwali (English:  )—also known as Dewali, Divali, or Deepavali (IAST: dīpāvalī)—comes from the Sanskrit dīpāvali meaning 'row or series of lights'. The term is derived from the Sanskrit words dīpa, 'lamp, light, lantern, candle, that which glows, shines, illuminates or knowledge' and āvali, 'a row, range, continuous line, series'.

Dates
The five-day celebration is observed every year sometime from the second half of October to the first half of November coinciding with a new moon (amāvasyā) as per the Hindu lunisolar calendar.
The festivities begin two days before amāvasyā, on Dhanteras, and extend two days after, until the second (or 17th) day of the month of Kartik. (According to Indologist Constance Jones, this night ends the lunar month of Ashwin and starts the month of Kartik – but see this note and Amanta and Purnima systems.) The darkest night is the apex of the celebration.
The festival climax is on the third day and is called the main Diwali. It is an official holiday in a dozen countries, while the other festive days are regionally observed as either public or optional restricted holidays in India. In Nepal, it is also a multiday festival, although the days and rituals are named differently, with the climax being called the Tihar festival by Hindus and Swanti festival by Buddhists.

History
The five-day long festival originated in the Indian subcontinent and is likely a fusion of harvest festivals in ancient India. It is mentioned in early Sanskrit texts, such as the Padma Purana and the Skanda Purana, both of which were composed between the 7th and 10th centuries. The diyas (lamps) are mentioned in Skanda Kishore Purana as symbolising parts of the sun, describing it as the cosmic giver of light and energy to all life and which seasonally transitions in the Hindu calendar month of Kartik.
Emperor Harsha refers to Deepavali, in the 7th-century Sanskrit play Nagananda, as Dīpapratipadotsava (dīpa = light, pratipadā = first day, utsava = festival), where lamps were lit and newly engaged brides and grooms received gifts. Rajasekhara referred to Deepavali as Dipamalika in his 9th-century Kavyamimamsa, wherein he mentions the tradition of homes being whitewashed and oil lamps decorated homes, streets, and markets in the night.

Diwali was also described by numerous travellers from outside India. In his 11th-century memoir on India, the Persian traveller and historian Al Biruni wrote of Deepavali being celebrated by Hindus on the day of the New Moon in the month of Kartika. The Venetian merchant and traveller Niccolò de' Conti visited India in the early 15th-century and wrote in his memoir, ""on another of these festivals they fix up within their temples, and on the outside of the roofs, an innumerable number of oil lamps... which are kept burning day and night"" and that the families would gather, ""clothe themselves in new garments"", sing, dance, and feast. The 16th-century Portuguese traveller Domingo Paes wrote of his visit to the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire, where Dipavali was celebrated in October with householders illuminating their homes, and their temples, with lamps. It is mentioned in the Ramayana that Diwali was celebrated for only 2 years in Ayodhya.
Islamic historians of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire era also mentioned Diwali and other Hindu festivals. A few, notably the Mughal emperor Akbar, welcomed and participated in the festivities, whereas others banned such festivals as Diwali and Holi, as Aurangzeb did in 1665.
Publications from the time of the British Raj also made mention of Diwali, such as the note on Hindu festivals published in 1799 by Sir William Jones, a philologist known for his early observations on Sanskrit and Indo-European languages. In his paper on The Lunar Year of the Hindus, Jones, then based in Bengal, noted four of the five days of Diwali in the autumn months of Aswina-Cartica  [sic] as the following: Bhutachaturdasi Yamaterpanam (2nd day), Lacshmipuja dipanwita (the day of Diwali), Dyuta pratipat Belipuja (4th day), and Bhratri dwitiya (5th day). The Lacshmipuja dipanwita, remarked Jones, was a ""great festival at night, in honour of Lakshmi, with illuminations on trees and houses"".

Epigraphy
Sanskrit inscriptions in stone and copper mentioning Diwali, occasionally alongside terms such as Dipotsava, Dipavali, Divali and Divalige, have been discovered at numerous sites across India. Examples include a 10th-century Rashtrakuta empire copper plate inscription of Krishna III (939–967 CE) that mentions Dipotsava, and a 12th-century mixed Sanskrit-Kannada Sinda inscription discovered in the Isvara temple of Dharwad in Karnataka where the inscription refers to the festival as a ""sacred occasion"". According to Lorenz Franz Kielhorn, a German Indologist known for translating many Indic inscriptions, this festival is mentioned as Dipotsavam in verses 6 and 7 of the Ranganatha temple Sanskrit inscription of the 13th-century Venad Hindu king Ravivarman Samgramadhira. Part of the inscription, as translated by Kielhorn, reads: ""the auspicious festival of lights which disperses the most profound darkness, which in former days was celebrated by the kings Ila, Kartavirya and Sagara, (...) as Sakra (Indra) is of the gods, the universal monarch who knows the duties by the three Vedas, afterwards celebrated here at Ranga for Vishnu, resplendent with Lakshmi resting on his radiant lap.""
Jain inscriptions, such as the 10th-century Saundatti inscription about a donation of oil to Jinendra worship for the Diwali rituals, speak of Dipotsava. Another early 13th-century Sanskrit stone inscription, written in the Devanagari script, has been found in the north end of a mosque pillar in Jalore, Rajasthan evidently built using materials from a demolished Jain temple. The inscription states that Ramachandracharya built and dedicated a drama performance hall, with a golden cupola, on Diwali.

Religious significance
The religious significance of Diwali varies regionally within India. 
One tradition links the festival to legends in the Hindu epic Ramayana, where Diwali is the day Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, and Hanuman reached Ayodhya after a period of 14 years in exile after Rama's army of good, defeated demon king Ravana's army of evil. Throughout the epic, Rama's decisions were always in line with dharma (duty) and the Diwali festival serves as a reminder for followers of Hinduism to maintain their dharma in day-to-day life.
Per another popular tradition, in the Dvapara Yuga period, Krishna, an avatar of Vishnu, killed the demon Narakasura, who was the evil king of Pragjyotishapura, near present-day Assam, and released 16000 girls held captive by Narakasura. Diwali was celebrated as a signifier of triumph of good over evil after Krishna's Victory over Narakasura. The day before Diwali is remembered as Naraka Chaturdashi, the day on which Narakasura was killed by Krishna.

Many Hindus associate the festival with Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and wife of Vishnu. According to Pintchman, the start of the 5-day Diwali festival is stated in some popular contemporary sources as the day goddess Lakshmi was born from Samudra Manthana, the churning of the cosmic ocean of milk by the Devas (gods) and the Asuras (demons) – a Vedic legend that is also found in several Puranas such as the Padma Purana, while the night of Diwali is when Lakshmi chose and wed Vishnu. Along with Lakshmi, who is representative of Vaishnavism, Ganesha, the elephant-headed son of Parvati and Shiva of Shaivism tradition, is remembered as one who symbolises ethical beginnings and the remover of obstacles.
Hindus of eastern India associate the festival with the Goddess Kali, who symbolises the victory of good over evil. Hindus from the Braj region in northern India, parts of Assam, as well as southern Tamil and Telugu communities view Diwali as the day the god Krishna overcame and destroyed the evil demon king Narakasura, in yet another symbolic victory of knowledge and good over ignorance and evil.
Trade and merchant families and others also offer prayers to Saraswati, who embodies music, literature and learning and Kubera, who symbolises book-keeping, treasury and wealth management. In western states such as Gujarat, and certain northern Hindu communities of India, the festival of Diwali signifies the start of a new year.
Mythical tales shared on Diwali vary widely depending on region and even within Hindu tradition, yet all share a common focus on righteousness, self-inquiry and the importance of knowledge, which, according to Lindsey Harlan, an Indologist and scholar of Religious Studies, is the path to overcoming the ""darkness of ignorance"". The telling of these myths is reminiscent of the Hindu belief that good ultimately triumphs over evil.

Other religions
Originally a Hindu festival, Diwali has transcended religious lines. Diwali is celebrated by Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and Newar Buddhists, although for each faith it marks different historical events and stories, but nonetheless the festival represents the same symbolic victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil.

Jainism
In Jain religion, Diwali is celebrated in observance of ""Mahavira Nirvana Divas"", the physical death and final nirvana of Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankar of current time cycle. Nirvana is considered to be the state of a soul when it escapes from the cycle of birth and death, while experiencing its true nature of boundless bliss and infinite knowledge. The Jain Diwali celebrated in many parts of India has similar practices to the Hindu Diwali, such as the lighting of lamps. However, the focus of the Jain Diwali remains the dedication to Mahavira. According to the Jain tradition, this practice of lighting lamps first began on the day of Mahavira's nirvana in 527 BCE, when 18 kings who had gathered for Mahavira's final teachings issued a proclamation that lamps be lit in remembrance of the ""great light, Mahavira"". This traditional belief of the origin of Diwali, and its significance to Jains, is reflected in their historic artworks such as paintings.

Sikhism
Sikhs celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas in remembrance of the release of Guru Hargobind from the Gwalior Fort prison by the Mughal emperor Jahangir and the day he arrived at the Golden Temple in Amritsar. According to J.S. Grewal, a scholar of Sikhism and Sikh history, Diwali in the Sikh tradition is older than the sixth Guru Hargobind legend. Guru Amar Das, the third Guru of the Sikhs, built a well in Goindwal with eighty-four steps and invited Sikhs to bathe in its sacred waters on Baisakhi and Diwali as a form of community bonding. Over time, these spring and autumn festivals became the most important of Sikh festivals and holy sites such as Amritsar became focal points for annual pilgrimages. The festival of Diwali, according to Ray Colledge, highlights three events in Sikh history: the founding of the city of Amritsar in 1577, the release of Guru Hargobind from the Mughal prison, and the day of Bhai Mani Singh's martyrdom in 1738 as a result of his failure to pay a fine for trying to celebrate Diwali and thereafter refusing to convert to Islam.

Buddhism
Diwali is not a festival for most Buddhists, with the exception of the Newar people of Nepal who revere various deities in Vajrayana Buddhism and celebrate Diwali by offering prayers to Lakshmi. Newar Buddhists in Nepalese valleys also celebrate the Diwali festival over five days, in much the same way, and on the same days, as the Nepalese Hindu Diwali-Tihar festival. According to some observers, this traditional celebration by Newar Buddhists in Nepal, through the worship of Lakshmi and Vishnu during Diwali, is not syncretism but rather a reflection of the freedom within Mahayana Buddhist tradition to worship any deity for their worldly betterment.

Celebrations
In the lead-up to Diwali, celebrants prepare by cleaning, renovating, and decorating their homes and workplaces with diyas (oil lamps) and rangolis (colourful art circle patterns). During Diwali, people wear their finest clothes, illuminate the interior and exterior of their homes with saaki (earthen lamp), diyas and rangoli, perform worship ceremonies of Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and wealth, light fireworks, and partake in family feasts, where mithai (sweets) and gifts are shared.
The height of Diwali is celebrated on the third day coinciding with the darkest night of Ashvin or Kartika.
The common celebratory practices are known as the festival of light, however there are minor differences from state to state in India. Diwali is usually celebrated twenty days after the Vijayadashami festival, with Dhanteras, or the regional equivalent, marking the first day of the festival when celebrants prepare by cleaning their homes and making decorations on the floor, such as rangolis. Some regions of India start Diwali festivities the day before Dhanteras with Govatsa Dwadashi. The second day is Naraka Chaturdashi. The third day is the day of Lakshmi Puja and the darkest night of the traditional month. In some parts of India, the day after Lakshmi Puja is marked with the Govardhan Puja and Balipratipada (Padwa). Some Hindu communities mark the last day as Bhai Dooj or the regional equivalent, which is dedicated to the bond between sister and brother, while other Hindu and Sikh craftsmen communities mark this day as Vishvakarma Puja and observe it by performing maintenance in their work spaces and offering prayers.

Rituals and preparations for Diwali begin days or weeks in advance, typically after the festival of Dusshera that precedes Diwali by about 20 days. The festival formally begins two days before the night of Diwali and ends two days thereafter. Each day has the following rituals and significance: Diwali has become more popular in other countries. In New York City lawmakers have passed legislation to make holidays in school. But debates over the holiday push back. In the future Diwali will be a holiday.

Dhanteras and Yama Deepam (Day 1)
Dhanteras, also known as Dhanatrayodashi, is derived from Dhan meaning wealth and teras meaning thirteenth, marks the thirteenth day of the dark fortnight of Ashwin or Kartik and the beginning of Diwali in most parts of India. On this day, many Hindus clean their homes and business premises. They install diyas, small earthen oil-filled lamps that they light up for the next five days, near Lakshmi and Ganesha iconography. Women and children decorate doorways within homes and offices with rangolis, colourful designs made from rice flour, flower petals, coloured rice or coloured sand, while the boys and men decorate the roofs and walls of family homes, markets, and temples and string up lights and lanterns. The day also marks a major shopping day for buying new utensils, home equipment, gold jewellery, firecrackers, and other items. On the evening of Dhanteras, families offer prayers (puja) to Lakshmi and Ganesha, and lay offerings of puffed rice, candy toys, rice cakes and batashas (hollow sugar cakes).
According to Tracy Pintchman, Dhanteras is a symbol of annual renewal, cleansing and an auspicious beginning for the next year. The term Dhan for this day also alludes to the Ayurvedic icon Dhanvantari, the god of health and healing, who is believed to have emerged from the ""churning of cosmic ocean"" on the same day as Lakshmi. Some communities, particularly those active in Ayurvedic and health-related professions, pray or perform havan rituals to Dhanvantari on Dhanteras.
On Yama Deepam (also known as Yama Dipadana or Jam ke Diya), Hindus light a diya, ideally made of wheat flour and filled with sesame oil, which faces south in the back of their homes. This is believed to please Yama, the god of death, and to ward off untimely death. Some Hindus observe Yama Deepam on the second night before the main day of Diwali.

Naraka Chaturdashi, Kali Chaudas, Chhoti Diwali, Hanuman Puja, Roop Chaudas, Yama Deepam (Day 2)
Naraka Chaturdashi, also known as Chhoti Diwali, is the second day of festivities coinciding with the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight of Ashwin or Kartik. The term ""chhoti"" means little, while ""Naraka"" means hell and ""Chaturdashi"" means ""fourteenth"". The day and its rituals are interpreted as ways to liberate any soul from suffering in ""Naraka"", or hell, as well as a reminder of spiritual auspiciousness. For some Hindus, it is a day to pray for the peace to the manes, or defiled souls of one's ancestors and light their way for their journeys in the cyclic afterlife. A mythological interpretation of this festive day is the destruction of the asura (demon) Narakasura by Krishna, a victory that frees 16,000 imprisoned princesses kidnapped by Narakasura. It is also celebrated as Roop Chaudas in some North Indian households, where women bathe before sunrise, while lighting a diya (lamp) in the bath area, they believe it helps enhance their beauty – it is a fun ritual that young girls enjoy as part of festivities. Ubtan is applied by the women which is made up of special gram flour mixed with herbs for cleansing and beautifying themselves.
Naraka Chaturdashi is also a major day for purchasing festive foods, particularly sweets. A variety of sweets are prepared using flour, semolina, rice, chickpea flour, dry fruit pieces powders or paste, milk solids (mawa or khoya) and clarified butter (ghee). According to Goldstein, these are then shaped into various forms, such as laddus, barfis, halwa, kachoris, shrikhand, and sandesh, rolled and stuffed delicacies, such as karanji, shankarpali, maladu, susiyam, pottukadalai. Sometimes these are wrapped with edible silver foil (vark). Confectioners and shops create Diwali-themed decorative displays, selling these in large quantities, which are stocked for home celebrations to welcome guests and as gifts. Families also prepare homemade delicacies for Lakshmi Pujan, regarded as the main day of Diwali. Chhoti Diwali is also a day for visiting friends, business associates and relatives, and exchanging gifts.
On the second day of Diwali, Hanuman Puja is performed in some parts of India especially in Gujarat. It coincides with the day of Kali Chaudas. It is believed that spirits roam around on the night of Kali Chaudas, and Hanuman, who is the deity of strength, power, and protection, is worshipped to seek protection from the spirits. Diwali is also celebrated to mark the return of Rama to Ayodhya after defeating the demon-king Ravana and completing his fourteen years of exile. The devotion and dedication of Hanuman pleased Rama so much that he blessed Hanuman to be worshipped before him. Thus, people worship Hanuman the day before Diwali's main day.
This day is commonly celebrated as Diwali in Tamil Nadu, Goa, and Karnataka. Traditionally, Marathi Hindus and South Indian Hindus receive an oil massage from the elders in the family on the day and then take a ritual bath, all before sunrise. Many visit their favourite Hindu temple.
Some Hindus observe Yama Deepam (also known as Yama Dipadana or Jam ke Diya) on the second day of Diwali, instead of the first day. A diya that is filled with sesame oil is lit at back of their homes facing in the southern direction. This is believed to please Yama, the god of death, and to ward off untimely death.

Lakshmi Pujan, Kali Puja (Day 3)
The third day is the height of the festival and coincides with the last day of the dark fortnight of Ashwin or Kartik. This is the day when Hindu, Jain and Sikh temples and homes are aglow with lights, thereby making it the ""festival of lights"". The word Deepawali comes from the Sanskrit word दीप (dīpa, “light”) and आवलि (āvali, “series, line, row”), where dīpa means an Indian lantern or lamp.

The youngest members in the family visit their elders, such as grandparents and other senior members of the community, on this day. Small business owners give gifts or special bonus payments to their employees between Dhanteras and Lakshmi Pujan. Shops either do not open or close early on this day allowing employees to enjoy family time. Shopkeepers and small operations perform puja rituals in their office premises. Unlike some other festivals, the Hindus typically do not fast during the five-day long Diwali including Lakshmi Pujan, rather they feast and share the bounties of the season at their workplaces, community centres, temples, and homes.

As the evening approaches, celebrants will wear new clothes or their best outfits, teenage girls and women, in particular, wear saris and jewellery. At dusk, family members gather for the Lakshmi Pujan, although prayers will also be offered to other deities, such as Ganesha, Saraswati, Rama, Lakshmana, Sita, Hanuman, or Kubera. The lamps from the puja ceremony are then used to light more earthenware lamps, which are placed in rows along the parapets of temples and houses, while some diyas are set adrift on rivers and streams. After the puja, people go outside and celebrate by lighting up patakhe (fireworks) together, and then share a family feast and mithai (sweets, desserts).
The puja and rituals in the Bengali Hindu community focus on Kali, the goddess of war, instead of Lakshmi. According to Rachel Fell McDermott, a scholar of South Asian, particular Bengali, studies, in Bengal during Navaratri (Dussehra elsewhere in India) the Durga puja is the main focus, although in the eastern and northeastern states the two are synonymous, but on Diwali the focus is on the puja dedicated to Kali. These two festivals likely developed in tandem over their recent histories, states McDermott. Textual evidence suggests that Bengali Hindus worshipped Lakshmi before the colonial era, and that the Kali puja is a more recent phenomenon. Contemporary Bengali celebrations mirror those found elsewhere, with teenage boys playing with fireworks and the sharing of festive food with family, but with the Shakti goddess Kali as the focus.

On the night of Diwali, rituals across much of India are dedicated to Lakshmi to welcome her into their cleaned homes and bring prosperity and happiness for the coming year. While the cleaning, or painting, of the home is in part for goddess Lakshmi, it also signifies the ritual ""reenactment of the cleansing, purifying action of the monsoon rains"" that would have concluded in most of the Indian subcontinent. Vaishnava families recite Hindu legends of the victory of good over evil and the return of hope after despair on the Diwali night, where the main characters may include Rama, Krishna, Vamana or one of the avatars of Vishnu, the divine husband of Lakshmi. At dusk, lamps placed earlier in the inside and outside of the home are lit up to welcome Lakshmi. Family members light up firecrackers, which some interpret as a way to ward off all evil spirits and the inauspicious, as well as add to the festive mood. According to Pintchman, who quotes Raghavan, this ritual may also be linked to the tradition in some communities of paying respect to ancestors. Earlier in the season's fortnight, some welcome the souls of their ancestors to join the family for the festivities with the Mahalaya. The Diwali night's lights and firecrackers, in this interpretation, represent a celebratory and symbolic farewell to the departed ancestral souls.
The celebrations and rituals of the Jains and the Sikhs are similar to those of the Hindus where social and community bonds are renewed. Major temples and homes are decorated with lights, festive foods shared with all, friends and relatives remembered and visited with gifts.

Annakut, Balipratipada (Padwa), New Year's Day, Govardhan Puja (Day 4)
The day after Diwali is the first day of the bright fortnight of Kartik. It is regionally called Annakut (heap of grain), Padwa, Goverdhan puja, Bali Pratipada, Bali Padyami, Kartik Shukla Pratipada and other names. According to one tradition, the day is associated with the story of Bali's defeat at the hands of Vishnu. In another interpretation, it is thought to reference the legend of Parvati and her husband Shiva playing a game of dyuta (dice) on a board of twelve squares and thirty pieces, Parvati wins. Shiva surrenders his shirt and adornments to her, rendering him naked. According to Handelman and Shulman, as quoted by Pintchman, this legend is a Hindu metaphor for the cosmic process for creation and dissolution of the world through the masculine destructive power, as represented by Shiva, and the feminine procreative power, represented by Parvati, where twelve reflects the number of months in the cyclic year, while thirty are the number of days in its lunisolar month.

This day ritually celebrates the bond between the wife and husband, and in some Hindu communities, husbands will celebrate this with gifts to their wives. In other regions, parents invite a newly married daughter, or son, together with their spouses to a festive meal and give them gifts.
In some rural communities of the north, west and central regions, the fourth day is celebrated as Govardhan puja, honouring the legend of the Hindu god Krishna saving the cowherd and farming communities from incessant rains and floods triggered by Indra's anger, which he accomplished by lifting the Govardhan mountain. This legend is remembered through the ritual of building small mountain-like miniatures from cow dung. According to Kinsley, the ritual use of cow dung, a common fertiliser, is an agricultural motif and a celebration of its significance to annual crop cycles.
The agricultural symbolism is also observed on this day by many Hindus as Annakut, literally ""mountain of food"". Communities prepare over one hundred dishes from a variety of ingredients, which is then dedicated to Krishna before being shared among the community. Hindu temples on this day prepare and present ""mountains of sweets"" to the faithful who have gathered for darshan (visit). In Gujarat, Annakut is the first day of the new year and celebrated through the purchase of essentials, or sabras (literally, ""good things in life""), such as salt, offering prayers to Krishna and visiting temples. In Gujarat New Year is celebrated after the day of Diwali. In the early morning people take showers, do prayer at home, visit temples for worship and children in the evening visit neighbour's houses to say happy new year, shake hands, get mukhvas for dessert, and chocolate.

Bhai Duj, Bhau-Beej, Vishwakarma Puja (Day 5)
The last day of the festival, the second day of the bright fortnight of Kartik, is called Bhai Duj (literally ""brother's day""), Bhau Beej, Bhai Tilak or Bhai Phonta. It celebrates the sister-brother bond, similar in spirit to Raksha Bandhan but it is the brother that travels to meet the sister and her family. This festive day is interpreted by some to symbolise Yama's sister Yamuna welcoming Yama with a tilaka, while others interpret it as the arrival of Krishna at his sister Subhadra's place after defeating Narakasura. Subhadra welcomes him with a tilaka on his forehead.
The day celebrates the sibling bond between brother and sister. On this day the womenfolk of the family gather, perform a puja with prayers for the well-being of their brothers, then return to a ritual of feeding their brothers with their hands and receiving gifts. According to Pintchman, in some Hindu traditions the women recite tales where sisters protect their brothers from enemies that seek to cause him either bodily or spiritual harm. In historic times, this was a day in autumn when brothers would travel to meet their sisters or invite their sister's family to their village to celebrate their sister-brother bond with the bounty of seasonal harvests.
The artisan Hindu and Sikh community celebrates the fourth day as the Vishwakarma puja day. Vishwakarma is the presiding Hindu deity for those in architecture, building, manufacturing, textile work and crafts trades. The looms, tools of trade, machines and workplaces are cleaned and prayers offered to these livelihood means.

Other traditions and significance
During the season of Diwali, numerous rural townships and villages host melas, or fairs, where local producers and artisans trade produce and goods. A variety of entertainments are usually available for inhabitants of the local community to enjoy. The women, in particular, adorn themselves in colourful attire and decorate their hands with henna. Such events are also mentioned in Sikh historical records. In the modern day, Diwali mela are held at college, or university, campuses or as community events by members of the Indian diaspora. At such events a variety of music, dance and arts performances, food, crafts, and cultural celebrations are featured.

Economics
Diwali marks a major shopping period in India, and is comparable to the Christmas period in terms of consumer purchases and economic activity. It is traditionally a time when households purchase new clothing, home refurbishments, gifts, gold, jewelry, and other large purchases particularly as the festival is dedicated to Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and such purchases are considered auspicious. According to Rao, Diwali is one of the major festivals where rural Indians spend a significant portion of their annual income, and is a means for them to renew their relationships and social networks.

Other goods that are bought in substantial quantities during Diwali include confectionery and fireworks. In 2013, about ₹25 billion (US$290 million) of fireworks were sold to merchants for the Diwali season, an equivalent retail value of about ₹50 billion (US$570 million) according to The Times of India. ASSOCHAM, a trade organisation in India, forecasted that online shopping alone to be over ₹300 billion (US$3.4 billion) over the 2017 Diwali season. About two-thirds of Indian households, according to the ASSOCHAM forecast, would spend between ₹5,000 (US$57) and ₹10,000 (US$110) to celebrate Diwali in 2017. Stock markets like NSE and BSE in India are typically closed during Diwali, with the exception of a Diwali Muhurat trading session for an hour in the evening to coincide with the beginning of the new year. In 2020, the INDF ETF was launched to mark the start of Diwali.

Politics
Diwali has increasingly attracted cultural exchanges, becoming occasions for politicians and religious leaders worldwide to meet Hindu or Indian origin citizens, diplomatic staff or neighbours. Many participate in other socio-political events as a symbol of support for diversity and inclusiveness. The Catholic dicastery Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, founded as Secretariat for non-Christians by Pope Paul VI, began sending official greetings and the Pope's message to the Hindus on Diwali in the mid-1990s.
Many governments encourage or sponsor Diwali-related festivities in their territories. For example, the Singaporean government, in association with the Hindu Endowments Board of Singapore, organises many cultural events during Diwali every year. National and civic leaders such as the former Prince Charles have attended Diwali celebrations at prominent Hindu temples in the UK, such as the Swaminarayan Temple in Neasden, using the occasion to highlight contributions of the Hindu community to British society. Additionally, cities across the UK show support of the celebrations through Diwali lights, decorations, and cultural festivities such as dance performances, food stalls and workshops. Since 2009, Diwali has been celebrated every year at 10 Downing Street, the residence of the British Prime Minister.
Diwali was first celebrated in the White House by George W. Bush in 2003, and its religious and historical significance was officially recognized by the United States Congress in 2007. Barack Obama became the first president to personally attend Diwali at the White House in 2009. On the eve of his first visit to India as President of the United States, Obama released an official statement sharing his best wishes with ""those celebrating Diwali"".
Every year during Diwali, Indian forces approach their Pakistani counterparts at the border bearing gifts of traditional Indian confectionery, a gesture that is returned in kind by the Pakistani soldiers who give Pakistani sweets to the Indian soldiers.

Hazards
The use of firecrackers on Diwali increases the concentration of dust and pollutants in the air. After firing, the fine dust particles get settled on the surrounding surfaces which are packed with chemicals like copper, zinc, sodium, lead, magnesium, cadmium and pollutants like oxides of sulfur and nitrogen. These invisible yet harmful particles affect the environment and in turn, put people's health at stake. The smoke created by firecrackers lit up on Diwali causes smog which sometimes takes days to clear.
During Diwali, the levels of suspended particulate matter increase. When people are exposed to these pollutant particles, they may suffer from eye, nose, and throat-related problems. To produce colours when crackers are burst, carcinogenic and poisonous elements are used.
During the 2023 celebration, New Delhi briefly took the top spot in the world for air pollution with an air quality index of 680 on one night.
The use of fireworks during Diwali can also lead to burn injuries. One particular firework called anar (fountain) has been found to be responsible for 65% of such injuries, with adults being the typical victims. Most of the injuries sustained are Group I type burns (minor) requiring only outpatient care. Experts urge precaution around candles and fires and ask for children to be kept a safe distance from flames and to enjoy the festivity of Diwali.

Guinness World Record
In 2023, a Diwali celebration in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India, broke the Guinness World Record for the largest display of oil lamps with 2,223,676 displayed on the eve of Diwali.

Description
Holi is a sacred ancient tradition of Hindus, a holiday in many states of India with regional holidays in other countries. It is a cultural celebration that gives Hindus and non-Hindus alike an opportunity to have fun and play with other people by throwing coloured water and powder at each other. It is also observed broadly on the Indian subcontinent. Holi is celebrated at the end of winter, on the last full moon day of the Hindu luni-solar calendar month, marking the spring, making the date vary with the lunar cycle. The date falls typically in March, but sometimes late February of the Gregorian calendar.
The festival has many purposes; most prominently, it celebrates the beginning of spring. In 17th century literature, it was identified as a festival that celebrated agriculture, commemorated good spring harvests, and the fertile land. Hindus believe it is a time to enjoying spring's abundant colors and say farewell to winter. To many Hindus, Holi festivities mark an occasion to reset and renew ruptured relationships, end conflicts, and rid themselves of accumulated emotional impurities from the past.
It also has a religious purpose, symbolically signified by the legend of Holika. The night before Holi, bonfires are lit in a ceremony known as Holika Dahan (burning of Holika) or Little Holi. People gather near fires, sing and dance. The next day, Holi, also known as Dhuli in Sanskrit, or Dhulheti, Dhulandi or Dhulendi, is celebrated.
In northern parts of India, children spray coloured powder solutions (gulal) at each other, laugh, and celebrate, while adults smear dry coloured powder (abir) on each other's faces. Visitors to homes are first teased with colours, then served with Holi delicacies (such as gujhia, shakkarpaare, matri, and dahi vada), desserts and drinks. After playing with colours, and cleaning up, people bathe, put on clean clothes, and visit friends and family.
 Like Holika Dahan, Kama Dahanam is celebrated in some parts of India. The festival of colours in these parts is called Rangapanchami, and occurs on the fifth day after Poornima (full moon).

History
The Holi festival is an ancient Hindu festival with its own cultural rituals which emerged before the Gupta period. The festival of colours finds mentioned in numerous scriptures, such as in works like Jaimini's Purva Mimamsa Sutras and Kathaka-Grhya-Sutras with even more detailed descriptions in ancient texts like the Narada Purana and Bhavishya Purana. The festival of ""holikotsav"" was also mentioned in the 7th century work, Ratnavali, by King Harsha. It is mentioned in the Puranas, Dasakumara Charita by Daṇḍin, and by the poet Kālidāsa during the 4th century reign of Chandragupta II.
The celebration of Holi is also mentioned in the 7th-century Sanskrit drama Ratnavali. The festival of Holi caught the fascination of European traders and British colonial staff by the 17th century. Various old editions of the Oxford English Dictionary mention it, but with varying, phonetically derived spellings: Houly (1687), Hooly (1698), Huli (1789), Hohlee (1809), Hoolee (1825), and Holi in editions published after 1910.

Legends
Radha Krishna
In the Braj region of India, where the Hindu deities Radha and Krishna grew up, the festival is celebrated until Rang Panchmi in commemoration of their divine love for each other. The festivities officially usher in spring, with Holi celebrated as a festival of love. Garga Samhita, a puranic work by Sage Garga was the first work of literature to mention the romantic description of Radha and Krishna playing Holi. There is also a popular symbolic legend behind the festival. In his youth, Krishna despaired whether the fair-skinned Radha would like him because of his dark skin colour. His mother Yashoda, tired of his desperation, asks him to approach Radha and ask her to colour his face in any colour she wanted. This Radha did, and Radha and Krishna became a couple. Ever since, the playful colouring of Radha and Krishna's faces has been commemorated as Holi. Beyond India, these legends help to explain the significance of Holi (Phagwah), which is common in some Caribbean communities of Indian origin such as Guyana, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica. It is also celebrated with great fervour in Mauritius, Fiji, and South Africa.

Vishnu
There is a symbolic legend found in the 7th chapter of the Bhagavata Purana explaining why Holi is celebrated as a festival of triumph of good over evil in the honour of Hindu god Vishnu and his devotee Prahlada. King Hiranyakashipu, the father of Prahlada, was the king of demonic Asuras and had earned a boon that gave him five special powers: he could be killed by neither a human being nor an animal, neither indoors nor outdoors, neither at day nor at night, neither by astra (projectile weapons) nor by any shastra (handheld weapons), and neither on land nor in water or air. Hiranyakashipu grew arrogant, thought he was God, and demanded that everyone worship only him.
Hiranyakashipu's own son, Prahlada, however, remained devoted to Vishnu. This infuriated Hiranyakashipu. He subjected Prahlada to cruel punishments, none of which affected the boy or his resolve to do what he thought was right. Finally, Holika, Prahlada's evil aunt, tricked him into sitting on a pyre with her. Holika was wearing a cloak that made her immune to injury from fire, while Prahlada was not. As the fire spread, the cloak flew from Holika and encased Prahlada, who survived while Holika burned. Vishnu, the god who appears as an avatar to restore Dharma in Hindu beliefs, took the form of Narasimha – half human and half lion (which is neither a human nor an animal), at dusk (when it was neither day nor night), took Hiranyakashyapu at a doorstep (which was neither indoors nor outdoors), placed him on his lap (which was neither land, water nor air), and then eviscerated and killed the king with his lion claws (which were neither a handheld weapon nor a launched weapon).
The Holika bonfire and Holi signifies the celebration of the symbolic victory of good over evil, of Prahlada over Hiranyakashipu, and of the fire that burned Holika.

Kama and Rati
Among other Hindu traditions such as Shaivism and Shaktism, the legendary significance of Holi is linked to Shiva in yoga and deep meditation. Goddess Parvati wanting to bring Shiva back into the world, seeks help from the Hindu god of love called Kamadeva on Vasant Panchami. The love god shoots arrows at Shiva, the yogi opens his third eye and burns Kama to ashes. This upsets both Kama's wife Rati (Kamadevi) and his own wife Parvati. Rati performs her own meditative asceticism for forty days, upon which Shiva understands, forgives out of compassion and restores the god of love. This return of the god of love, is celebrated on the 40th day after the Vasant Panchami festival as Holi. The Kama legend and its significance to Holi has many variant forms, particularly in South India.

Cultural significance
The Holi festival has a cultural significance among various Hindu traditions of the Indian subcontinent. It is the festive day to end and rid oneself of past errors, to end conflicts by meeting others, a day to forget and forgive. People pay or forgive debts, as well as deal anew with those in their lives. Holi also marks the start of spring, an occasion for people to enjoy the changing seasons and make new friends.
Holi is of particular significance in the Braj region, which includes locations traditionally associated with Radha Krishna: Mathura, Vrindavan, Nandgaon, Barsana, and Gokula. These places are popular tourist attractions during Holi.
Outside India, Holi is observed by Hindus in Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan as well as in countries with large diaspora populations from India around the world. The Holi rituals and customs can vary with local adaptations.

Other Indian religions
The festival has traditionally been also observed by non-Hindus, such as by Sikhs, Jains and Newars (Nepal).
In Mughal India, Holi was celebrated with such exuberance that people of all castes could throw colour on the Emperor. According to Sharma (2017), ""there are several paintings of Mughal emperors celebrating Holi"". Grand celebrations of Holi were held at the Lal Qila, where the festival was also known as Eid-e-gulaabi or Aab-e-Pashi. Mehfils were held throughout the walled city of Delhi with aristocrats and traders alike participating. This changed during the rule of Emperor Aurangzeb. He banned the public celebration of Holi using a Farman issue in November 1665. However, the celebration were later restarted after the death of Emperor Aurangzeb. Bahadur Shah Zafar himself wrote a song for the festival, while poets such as Amir Khusrau, Ibrahim Raskhan, Nazeer Akbarabadi and Mehjoor Lakhnavi relished it in their writings.
Sikhs have traditionally celebrated the festival, at least through the 19th century, with its historic texts referring to it as Hola. Guru Gobind Singh – the last human guru of the Sikhs – modified Holi with a three-day Hola Mohalla extension festival of martial arts. The extension started the day after the Holi festival in Anandpur Sahib, where Sikh soldiers would train in mock battles, compete in horsemanship, athletics, archery and military exercises.
Holi was observed by Maharaja Ranjit Singh and his Sikh Empire that extended across what are now northern parts of India and Pakistan. According to a report by Tribune India, Sikh court records state that 300 mounds of colours were used in 1837 by Ranjit Singh and his officials in Lahore. Ranjit Singh would celebrate Holi with others in the Bilawal gardens, where decorative tents were set up. In 1837, Sir Henry Fane who was the commander-in-chief of the British Indian army joined the Holi celebrations organised by Ranjit Singh. A mural in the Lahore Fort was sponsored by Ranjit Singh and it showed the Hindu god Krishna playing Holi with gopis. After the death of Ranjit Singh, his Sikh sons and others continued to play Holi every year with colours and lavish festivities. The colonial British officials joined these celebrations.

Celebrations
Holika Dahan
The night before Holi is called Holika Dahan or ""Chhoti Holi"" whereby people gather around a lit bonfire, symbolising the victory of good over evil as well as the removal of the old and arrival of the new. Various rituals are performed around the fire such as singing and dancing. This ritual is derived from the story of Holika, who attempted to kill Prahlada, the son of Hiranyakashipu, through the flames of a bonfire. Although Holika was endowed with a boon to remain immune to fire, she was burned to ashes, while Prahlada remained unharmed.

Main day
The next morning is celebrated as Rangwali Holi (Dhuleti) where people smear and drench each other with colours. Water guns and water-filled balloons are often used to play and colour each other, with anyone and any place being considered fair game to colour. Groups often carry drums and other musical instruments going from place to place, singing and dancing. Throughout the day, people visit family, and friends and foes come together to chat, enjoy food and drinks, and partake in Holi delicacies. Holi is also a festival of forgiveness and new starts, which ritually aims to generate harmony in society. Many cities in Uttar Pradesh also organise Kavi sammelan in the evening.
Groups sing and dance, some playing drums and dholak. After each stop of fun and play with colours, people offer gujiya, mathri, malpuas and other traditional delicacies. Cold drinks, including drinks made with marijuana, are also part of the Holi festivity.

India
Bihar, Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand
Holi is known as Phaguwa or Fagua in the Bhojpuri language. In this region as well, the legend of Holika is prevalent. On the eve of Phalgun Poornima, people light bonfires. They put dried cow dung cakes, wood of the Araad or Redi tree and Holika tree, grains from the fresh harvest and unwanted wood leaves in the bonfire. At the time of Holika people assemble near the pyre. The eldest member of the gathering or a purohit initiates the lighting. He then smears others with colour as a mark of greeting. Next day the festival is celebrated with colours and much frolic. Traditionally, people also clean their houses to mark the festival.
Holi Milan is also observed in Bihar, where family members and well-wishers visit each other's family, apply colours (abeer) on each other's faces, and on feet, if elderly. Usually, this takes place on the evening of Holi, day after Holi with wet colours is played in the morning through the afternoon. Due to large-scale internal migration issues faced by the people, recently, this tradition has slowly begun to transform, and it is common to have Holi Milan on an entirely different day either before or after the actual day of Holi.
Children and youths take extreme delight in the festival. Though the festival is usually celebrated with colours, in some places, people also enjoy celebrating Holi with water solutions of mud or clay. Folk songs are sung at high pitch and people dance to the sound of the dholak (a two-headed hand-drum) and the spirit of Holi. Intoxicating bhang, made from cannabis, milk and spices, is consumed with a variety of mouth-watering delicacies, such as pakoras and thandai, to enhance the mood of the festival.
In the Kanpur, Holi lasts for seven days. On the last day, a fair called Ganga Mela or the Holi Mela is celebrated. The fair was started by freedom fighters who fought British rule.
In Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh, a special event called ""Holi Milan"" is celebrated.

Goa
Holi is locally called Ukkuli in Konkani. It is celebrated around the Konkani temple called Gosripuram temple. It is a part of the Goan or Konkani spring festival known as Śigmo or शिगमो in Koṅkaṇī or Śiśirotsava, which lasts for about a month. The colour festival or Holi is a part of longer, more extensive spring festival celebrations. Holi festivities (but not Śigmo festivities) include: Holika Puja and Dahan, Dhulvad or Dhuli vandan, Haldune or offering yellow and saffron colour or Gulal to the deity.

Gujarat
In Gujarat, Holi is a two-day festival. On the evening of the first day, a bonfire is lit and raw coconut and corn is offered to the fire. The second day is the festival of colour or ""Dhuleti"", celebrated by sprinkling coloured water and applying colours to each other. Dwarka, a coastal city of Gujarat, celebrates Holi at the Dwarkadhish temple with citywide music festivities. Holi marks the agricultural season of the rabi crop.
In some places, there is a custom in undivided Hindu families that the woman beats her brother-in-law with a sari rolled up into a rope in a mock rage and tries to drench him with colours, and in turn, the brother-in-law brings sweets (Indian desserts) to her in the evening.

Jammu and Kashmir
In Jammu and Kashmir, Holi celebrations are much in line with the general definition of Holi celebrations: a high-spirited festival to mark the beginning of the harvesting of the summer crop, with the throwing of coloured water and powder and singing and dancing.

Karnataka
Traditionally, in rural Karnataka, children collect money and wood in the weeks prior to Holi, and on ""Kamadahana"" night, all the wood is put together and lit. The festival is celebrated for two days. People in northern parts of Karnataka prepare special food on this day. Holi festival is also depicted on medieval reliefs and sculptures, notably on 12th century Chennakesava temple in Belur and 15th century relief from Hampi, where people are dipicted playing holi with colors and pichkaris.
In Sirsi, Karnataka, Holi is celebrated with a unique folk dance called ""Bedara Vesha"", which is performed during the nights beginning five days before the actual festival day. The festival is celebrated every alternate year in the town, which attracts a large number of tourists from different parts of India.
Wooden idols of Kamanna and Rati are put on public display and taken on parade in some parts of Karnataka. Large idols of Kama made of bamboo are burnt after Holi Hunnime festival in northern Karnataka. Ramalinga Kamanna Utsava is a unique festival celebrated in Navalgund, Karnataka, during Holi. The festivities center around the installation of an idol of Kamanna, representing Kamadeva (the god of love), at the Ramalingeshwara Temple. Devotees from various regions gather to offer silver articles, such as cradles for those desiring children, believing their wishes will be fulfilled.

Maharashtra
In Konkan region of Maharashtra, Holi season is also celebrated as Shimga or shimgo, festivities that lasts for almost a month. A week before the festival, youngsters go around the community, collecting firewood and money. On the day of holi, the firewood is heaped into a huge pile in each neighbourhood. In the evening, the fire is lit. Every household brings a meal and dessert, in the honour of the fire god. Puran Poli is the main delicacy and children shout ""Holi re Holi puranachi poli"". Shimga celebrates the elimination of all evil. The colour celebrations here take place on the day of Rang Panchami, five days after main day of holi. During this festival, people are supposed to forget and forgive any rivalries and start new healthy relations with all.

Manipur
Manipuris celebrate Holi for 6 days. Here, this holiday merges with the festival of Yaosang. Traditionally, the festival commences with the burning of a thatched hut of hay and twigs. Young children go from house to house to collect money, locally known as nakadeng (or nakatheng), as gifts on the first two days. The youths at night perform a group folk dance called Thabal chongba on the full moon night of Lamta (Phalgun), traditionally accompanied by folk songs and rhythmic beats of the indigenous drum, but nowadays by modern bands and fluorescent lamps. In Krishna temples, devotees sing devotional songs, perform dances and celebrate with aber (gulal) wearing traditional white and yellow turbans. On the last day of the festival, large processions are taken out to the main Krishna temple near Imphal where several cultural activities are held. In recent decades, Yaosang, a type of Indian sport, has become common in many places of the valley, where people of all ages come out to participate in a number of sports that are somewhat altered for the holiday.

Odisha
The people of Odisha celebrate Dola or Pushpadola (Dola Jatra purnima) on the day of Holi where the icons of Jagannath replace the icons of Krishna and Radha. Dola Melana, processions of the deities are celebrated in villages and bhoga is offered to the deities. ""Dola yatra"" was prevalent even before 1560 much before Holi was started where the idols of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra used to be taken to the ""Dolamandapa"" (podium in Jagannath temple). People used to offer natural colours known as ""abira"" to the deities and apply on each other's feats.

Punjab
In Punjab, the eight days preceding Holi are known as luhatak. Sekhon (2000) states that people start throwing colours many days before Holi.
Holi is preceded by Holika Dahan the night before when a fire is lit. Historically, the Lubana community of Punjab celebrated holi ""with great pomp and show. The Lubanas buried a pice and betel nut. They heaped up cow-dung cakes over the spot and made a large fire. When the fire had burnt out, they proceeded to hunt for the pice and betel-nut. Whosoever found these, was considered very lucky."" Elsewhere in Punjab, Holi was also associated with making fools of others. Bose writing in Cultural Anthropology: And Other Essays in 1929 noted that ""the custom of playing Holi-fools is prevalent in Punjab"".
On the day of Holi, people engage in throwing colours on each other. For locals, Holi marks the end of winter. The Punjabi saying Phaggan phal laggan (Phagun is the month for fructifying) exemplifies the seasonal aspect of Holi. Trees and plants start blossoming from the day of Basant and start bearing fruit by Holi.
During Holi in Punjab, walls and courtyards of rural houses are enhanced with drawings and paintings similar to rangoli in South India, mandana in Rajasthan, and rural arts in other parts of India. This art is known as chowk-poorana or chowkpurana in Punjab and is given shape by the peasant women of the state. In courtyards, this art is drawn using a piece of cloth. The art includes drawing tree motifs, flowers, ferns, creepers, plants, peacocks, palanquins, geometric patterns along with vertical, horizontal and oblique lines. These arts add to the festive atmosphere.
Folk theatrical performances known as swang or nautanki take place during Holi, with the latter originating in the Punjab. According to Self (1993), Holi fairs are held in the Punjab which may go on for many days. Bose (1961) states that ""in some parts of Punjab, Holi is celebrated with wrestling matches"".

Telangana
Holi is called as Kamuni Punnami/Kama Purnima or Jajiri in Telugu. Hindus celebrate Holi as it relates to the legend of Kamadeva. Holi is also known by different names: Kamavilas, Kamuni Panduga and Kama-Dahanam.
It is a 10-day festival in Telangana, of which last two days are of great importance. As in other parts of India, in rural Telangana, the 9 days preceding Holi, children celebrate kamuda by playing Kolata sticks along with singing folk songs called jajiri and collect money, rice, corn and wood. For this reason Holi is well known for ""Jajiri Paatalu Kamudi aatalu"", which means festival of ""Jajiri songs and Kamudi games"" and on 9th night i.e. Holy eve, all the wood is put together and set on fire representing Kama Dahanam.
Next morning i.e. 10th day is celebrated as Holi, with colours traditionally extracted from Moduga/Gogu Flowers (Palash/Butea monosperma).

Tripura
In Tripura Holi is known as ""Pali"" which means colour in Tripuri language, it's celebrated all over Tripura.

Western Uttar Pradesh
Barsana, a town near Mathura in the Braj region of Uttar Pradesh, celebrates Lathmar Holi in the sprawling compound of the Radha Rani Temple. Thousands gather to witness the Lath Mar Holi when women beat up men with sticks as those on the sidelines become hysterical, sing Holi songs and shout ""Radhe Radhe"" or ""Sri Radhe Krishna"". The Holi songs of Braj Mandal are sung in pure Braj, the local language. Holi celebrated at Barsana is unique in the sense that here women chase men away with sticks. Males also sing provocative songs in a bid to invite the attention of women. Women then go on the offensive and use long staves called lathis to beat the men, who protect themselves with shields.
Mathura, in the Braj region, is the birthplace of Krishna. In Vrindavan this day is celebrated with special puja and the traditional custom of worshipping Radha Krishna; here the festival lasts for sixteen days. All over the Braj region and neighbouring places like Hathras, Aligarh, and Agra, Holi is celebrated in more or less the same way as in Mathura, Vrindavan and Barsana.
A traditional celebration includes Matki Phod, similar to Dahi Handi in Maharashtra and Gujarat during Krishna Janmashtami, both in the memory of god Krishna who is also called makhan chor (literally, butter thief). This is a historic tradition of the Braj region as well as the western region of India. An earthen pot filled with butter or other milk products is hung high by a rope. Groups of boys and men climb on each other's shoulders to form pyramids to reach and break it, while girls and women sing songs and throw coloured water on the pyramid to distract them and make their job harder. This ritual sport continues in Hindu diaspora communities.

Uttarakhand
Kumaoni Holi in Uttarakhand includes a musical affair. It takes different forms such as the Baithki Holi, the Khari Holi and the Mahila Holi. In Baithki Holi and Khari Holi, people sing songs with a touch of melody, fun, and spiritualism. These songs are essentially based on classical ragas. Baithki Holi (बैठकी होली), also known as Nirvan Ki Holi, begins from the premises of temples, where Holiyars (होल्यार) sing Holi songs and people gather to participate, along with playing classical music. The songs are sung in a particular sequence depending on the time of day; for instance, at noon the songs are based on Peelu, Bhimpalasi and Sarang ragas, while evening songs are based on the ragas such as Kalyan, Shyamkalyan and Yaman. The Khari Holi (खड़ी होली) is mostly celebrated in the rural areas of Kumaon. The songs of the Khari Holi are sung by the people, who, sporting traditional white churidar payajama and kurta, dance in groups to the tune of ethnic musical instruments such as the dhol and hurka.
In the Kumaon region, the Holika pyre, known as Cheer (चीर), is ceremonially built in a ceremony known as Cheer Bandhan (चीर बंधन) fifteen days before Dulhendi. The Cheer is a bonfire with a green Paiya tree branch in the middle. The Cheer of every village and neighbourhood is rigorously guarded as rival mohallas try to playfully steal each other's cheer.
The colours used on Holi are derived from natural sources. Dulhendi, known as Charadi (छरड़ी) (from Chharad (छरड़)), is made from flower extracts, ash and water. Holi is celebrated with great gusto much in the same way all across North India.

West Bengal
In West Bengal, the tradition of Dol Jatra (meaning Swing procession) or Dolotsava (meaning Swing Festival) or Dol Purnima - (Swing Full Moon) is common among Gaudiya Vaishnavs just like among Vaishnavs in Braj region and other Krishna centric sampradays all over India. However, several Bengali Vaishnava padavalis also use the term Holi (Bangla: হোলী) for the festival.

In Shantiniketan, West Bengal, Holi is additionally also known as ""Basanta Utsab"". The festival is celebrated by worshipping the icons of Radha and Krishna by placing them on a decorated swing. On the Dol Purnima day in the early morning, students (mainly in Shantiniketan) dress up in saffron-coloured or pure white clothes and wear garlands of fragrant flowers. They sing and dance to the accompaniment of musical instruments, such as the ektara, dubri, and veena. The devotees take turns to swing them while women dance around the swing and sing songs. During these activities, the people keep throwing coloured water and dry colours, abir, at them.
Around 500 years ago, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu went to Vrindavan in present-day Uttar Pradesh to witness the festival there at the birthplace of Lord Sri Krishna. After his return to Bengal, he thought of starting the festival here. So he asked his followers to smear color or abir to Lord Krishna's idol and then put that abir on each other. He also instructed them to give the other person a treat with a local sweet called malpoa. The biographies of Sri Chaitanya say that he was very fond of this sweet.

Nepal
Holi, also known as Phagu Purnima, along with many other Hindu festivals, is celebrated in Nepal as a national festival. It is an important major Nepal-wide festival along with Dashain and Tihar (Dipawali). It is celebrated in the Nepali month of Falgun (Terai region celebrates on the same date as Indian Holi, while rest of the country celebrates it a day earlier), and signifies the legends of the Hindu god Krishna. They worship Saraswati shrine in Vajrayogini temples and celebrate the festival with their Hindu friends.
Traditional concerts are held in most cities in Nepal, including Kathmandu, Narayangarh, Pokhara, Itahari, Hetauda, and Dharan, and are broadcast on television with various celebrity guests.
People walk through their neighbourhoods to celebrate Holi by exchanging colours and spraying coloured water on one another. A popular activity is the throwing of water balloons at one another, sometimes called lola (meaning water balloon). Many people mix bhang (made from cannabis, milk and spices) in their drinks and food, as is also done during Shivaratri. It is believed that the combination of different colours at this festival takes all sorrow away and makes life itself more colourful.

Pakistan
Holi is celebrated by the minority Hindu population in Pakistan. Community events by Hindus have been reported by Pakistani media in various cities such as Karachi, Hazara, Rawalpindi, Sindh, Hyderabad, Multan and Lahore. The Hindu tribes of Cholistan play the game called Khido in the days leading up to the Holi. The game Khido is considered sacred by them as it is believed that Parhlad used to play this game during his childhood.
However, some cases have been reported where Hindus have been discriminated against and attacked while celebrating Holi in educational institutions. 
Holi was not a public holiday in Pakistan from 1947 to 2016. Holi along with Diwali for Hindus, and Easter for Christians, was adopted as public holiday resolution by Pakistan's parliament in 2016, giving the local governments and public institutions the right to declare Holi as a holiday and grant leave for its minority communities, for the first time. This decision has been controversial, with some Pakistanis welcoming the decision, while others criticising it, with the concern that declaring Holi a public holiday advertises a Hindu festival to Pakistani children.

Indian diaspora
Over the years, Holi has become an important festival in many regions wherever Indian diaspora were either taken as indentured labourers during colonial era, or where they emigrated on their own, and are now present in large numbers such as in Africa, North America, Europe, Latin America, and parts of Asia such as Fiji.

Members of Hindu associations and volunteers assist in hosting the event along with temple devotees. Some of the places known to celebrate Holi are New Brunswick (New Jersey), Spanish Fork (Utah), Houston (Texas), Dallas (Texas), South El Monte (California), Milpitas (California), Mountain House (California), Tracy (California), Lathrop (California), Chicago (Illinois), Potomac (Maryland), Tampa (Florida), Sterling (Virginia), and Boston (Massachusetts).

Indonesia
In Indonesia, Indian Indonesians and Balinese Hindu people celebrate Holi as festival of colours. The main celebrations are in Medan and Bali.
Sometimes the Indian immigrants from other countries may also celebrate a small-scale version of Holi.

Holi colours
Traditional sources of colours
The spring season, during which the weather changes, is believed to cause viral fever and cold. The playful throwing of natural coloured powders, called gulal has a medicinal significance: the colours are traditionally made of palash, neem, kumkum, haldi, bilva, and other medicinal herbs suggested by Āyurvedic doctors.
Many colours are obtained by mixing primary colours. Artisans produce and sell many of the colours from natural sources in dry powder form, in weeks and months preceding Holi. Some of the traditional natural plant-based sources of colours are:

Orange and red
The flowers of palash or tesu tree, also called the flame of the forest, are typical source of bright red and deep orange colours. Powdered fragrant red sandalwood, dried hibiscus flowers, madder tree, radish, and pomegranate are alternate sources and shades of red. Mixing lime with turmeric powder creates an alternate source of orange powder, as does boiling saffron (kesar) in water.

Green
Mehendi and dried leaves of gulmohur tree offer a source of green colour. In some areas, the leaves of spring crops and herbs have been used as a source of green pigment.

Yellow
Haldi (turmeric) powder is the typical source of yellow colour. Sometimes this is mixed with chickpea (gram) or other flour to get the right shade. Bael fruit, amaltas, species of chrysanthemums, and species of marigold are alternate sources of yellow.

Blue
Indigo plant, Indian berries, species of grapes, blue hibiscus, and jacaranda flowers are traditional sources of blue colour for Holi.

Magenta and purple
Beetroot is the traditional source of magenta and purple colour. Often these are directly boiled in water to prepare coloured water.

Brown
Dried tea leaves offer a source of brown coloured water. Certain clays are alternate source of brown.

Black
Species of grapes, fruits of amla (gooseberry) and vegetable carbon (charcoal) offer grey to black colours.

Issues
Health impact
A 2007 study found that malachite green, a synthetic bluish-green dye used in some colours during Holi festival, was responsible for severe eye irritation in Delhi, if eyes were not washed upon exposure. Though the study found that the pigment did not penetrate through the cornea, malachite green is of concern and needs further study.
Another 2009 study reports that some colours produced and sold in India contain metal-based industrial dyes, causing an increase in skin problems to some people in the days following Holi. These colours are produced in India, particularly by small informal businesses, without any quality checks and are sold freely in the market. The colours are sold without labelling, and the consumer lacks information about the source of the colours, their contents, and possible toxic effects. In recent years, several non-governmental organisations have started campaigning for safe practices related to the use of colours. Some are producing and marketing ranges of safer colours derived from natural sources such as vegetables and flowers.
These reports have galvanised a number of groups into promoting more natural celebrations of Holi. Development Alternatives, Delhi's CLEAN India campaign, Kalpavriksh Environment Action Group, Pune, Society for Child Development through its Avacayam Cooperative Campaign have launched campaigns to help children learn to make their own colours for Holi from safer, natural ingredients. Meanwhile, some commercial companies such as the National Botanical Research Institute have begun to market ""herbal"" dyes, though these are substantially more expensive than the dangerous alternatives. However, it may be noted that many parts of rural India have always resorted to natural colours (and other parts of festivities more than colours) due to availability.
In urban areas, some people wear nose masks and sunglasses to avoid inhaling pigments and to prevent chemical exposure to eyes.

Environmental impact
An alleged environmental issue related to the celebration of Holi is the traditional Holika bonfire, which is believed to contribute to deforestation. According to a local tabloid, 30,000 bonfires burn every year during Holi, with each fire burning approximately 100 kilograms (220 lb) of wood.
The use of heavy metal-based pigments during Holi is also reported to cause temporary wastewater pollution, with the water systems recovering to pre-festival levels within 5 days.

Influence on other cultures
Holi is celebrated as a social event in parts of the United States. For example, at Sri Sri Radha Krishna Temple in Spanish Fork, Utah, NYC Holi Hai in Manhattan, New York, and Festival of Colors: Holi NYC in New York City, New York.

Holi-inspired events
A number of Holi-inspired social events have also surfaced, particularly in Europe and the United States, often organised by companies as for-profit or charity events with paid admission, and with varying scheduling that does not coincide with the actual Holi festival. These have included Holi-inspired music festivals such as the Festival Of Colours Tour and Holi One (which feature timed throws of Holi powder), and 5K run franchises such as The Color Run, Holi Run and Color Me Rad, in which participants are doused with the powder at per-kilometre checkpoints. The BiH Color Festival is a Holi-inspired electronic music festival held annually in Brčko, Bosnia and Herzegovina. In recent years, schools across Australia have also adopted Holi inspired fund raising activities which leverage fundraising platforms such as Australian Fundraising, School Fun Run, Colour Frenzy and Go Raise It Australia to conduct such events. New Zealand schools have also followed the trend with holi powder Colour Run fundraisers run by local company Go Raise It NZ.

Legend
According to a story, Jimutvahana was king of Gandharvas. He gave up his kingdom to his brothers and went to forest to serve his father. He married malayavati. Once he saw an old woman mourning. She told him that she belongs to the nagavamsha (family of snakes). Due to an oath she has to offer her only son Sankhchuda to Garuda tomorrow to feed. Jimutvahana promised to protect her only son. Next day he lay on a bed of rocks and offered himself to Garuda. Garuda came and attacked Jimutvahana with his claws. Jimutvahana stayed calm and then Garuda stopped attacking. Garuda inquired about his identity and then Jimutvahana narrated the entire story. Impressed by his kindness and benevolence, Garuda promised that he will not take any sacrifices from the nagavamsha. To cherish this legend mothers keep fast for the wellbeing of their children.
This story is similar to Nagananda (The Joy of the Snakes), a Sanskrit play written by Emperor Harsha in the 7th century CE where Vidyadara king  Jimutvahana sacrifices his life for Naga to Garuda. According to the story, Jimutaketu was king of snow clad mountain country of Vidyadhara. In his house, there was a heaven-sent wishing tree, the legecy of his forefathers. He had no son, so he asked the tree for a son. Then a child was born and he named him Jimutvahana. He was full of compassion for all living beings. He spoke to his father and asked the wishing tree to banish poverty and give wealth to men. Then the tree sent gold showers on the earth and all men rejoiced. The fame of Jimutvahana extended far and wide.
Even king Jimutaketu filled with hatred as the throne was firmly fixed by his son's glory. They wanted to seize the place where a wishing tree grows, bent on war. Then Jimutvahana gave up fighting for Thorne with relatives and left the forest with his father and mother for the Malaya mountains. This was the place of Siddha, the prince. He wished to marry his sister Malayavati with Jimutvahana and Jimutvahana married her. In the past life, Jimutvahana was Vidyadhara and Malayavati was his wife. Once he saw a woman crying. The son of women, Sankhchuda, tells him that they are Nagas and the serpent king sent him to the rock of death. Sankhachuda told him that the Garuda son of Vinata started to kill nagas after getting a nector from Vishnu, as in the past Kadru made Vinata a slave. Garuda started eating snakes. Then the king of Snakes, Vasuki, foresaw the destruction of serpents and made a pact with Garuda to send one snake each day. Jimutvahana placed himself on the rock of death. Then Garuda came and the earth began to tremble. Garuda bore Jimutvahana away with his beak and started to eat. Then rain of flowers started to fall from heaven. Garuda wondered after this incident and stopped eating Jimutvahana. Garuda tells Jimutvahana that he is not a snake but Jimutvahana tells him that he is a snake. Then Sankhachuda told him that he was a sanke and Jimutvahana was not. Garuda realised that Jimutvahana was not a snake but king of vidyadharas and filled with gulit. Jimutvahana told Garuda to not eat any snakes further. Then Garuda goes to bring the nectar from the heaven to heal the wounds of Jimutvahana and bring back the life of Snakes whose bones lies in rock. Then Guari came from heaven and sprinkled the nectar on the feet of Jimutvahana. The Garuda came and sprinkled the nectar and the snakes again became alive with clothes. Then all the snakes and the mother, father and wife of Jimutvahana came and praised him. Then Jimutvahana reigned Vidhyadhara.

The Karam festival celebrated by diverse groups of people, including: Munda, Ho, Oraon, Bagal, Baiga, Binjhwari, Bhumij, Kharia, Kudmi, Karmali, Lohra, Korwa and many more.

Summary of the ritual
This festival celebrated for good harvest. Nine type of seeds planted in basket such as rice, wheat, corn etc which is called Jawa. Girl take care of these seeds for 7–9 days. In festival girls fast throughout day.
In the ritual, people go to the jungle accompanied by groups of drummers and cut one or more branches of the Karam tree after worshiping it. The branches are usually carried by unmarried, young girls who sing in praise of the deity. Then the branches are brought to the village and planted in the center of the ground which is plastered with cow-dung and decorated with flowers. A village priest (Pahan or Dehuri according to region) offers germinated grains and liquor in propitiation to the deity who grants wealth and children. A fowl is also killed and the blood is offered to the branch. The village priest then recites a legend to the villagers about the efficacy of Karam puja. After puja, in the next morning the karam branch immersed in the river.
The festival is observed in two ways. Firstly, it is commonly held by the villagers on the village street and the expenses on liquor etc. are commonly borne. Alternatively, it is celebrated by a man in his courtyard under his patronage to which he invites all. Even people who come uninvited listening to the sound of drums are also entertained with liquor.

Details
The Karam festival is celebrated usually on Bhado Ekadashi, on the eleventh day of the bright full moon (Purnima) of the month of Bhado (August–September). In some parts of jharkhand it was also celebrated in November. The Karam tree, scientifically named Nauclea Parvifolia is the center of the proceedings of the festival. The preparations for the Karam festival begin around ten or twelve days before the festival. Nine type of seeds planted in basket such as rice, wheat, corn etc which is called Jawa. Girl take care these seeds for 7–9 days.
The morning of the Karam festival begins with women pounding rice in the dheki, a wooden implement, to obtain rice flour. This rice flour is used to make a local delicacy which can be sweet as well as salty. This delicacy is cooked in the morning of the Karam festival for consumption, and shared throughout the neighborhood.
Then the people begin the ritual dance with a yellow bloom tucked behind their ear. A branch of the Karam tree is carried by the Karam dancers and passed among them while they are singing and dancing. This branch is washed with milk and rice beer (Tapan). Then, the branch is raised in the middle of the dancing arena. After reciting the legend - the story behind the worshiping of Karam (Nature/God/Goddess) - all the men and women drink liquor and spend the entire night singing and dancing; both are essential parts of the festival, Which is known as Karam Naach.
Women dance to the beat of drums and folk songs (siring). The Puja is followed by a community feast and the drinking of hariya. The next day, the Karam tree is sprinkled with curd of the seas and immersed in the river bed.

Philosophy
Karam is a harvest festival. The festival also has a close link to nature. People worship trees during this festival as they are a source of livelihood, and they pray to mother nature to keep their farmlands green and ensure a rich harvest. It is believed that the worship for good germination increases the fertility of grain crops. Karam Devta (the God of power, youth and youthfulness) is worshiped during the festival. The devotees keep a day-long fast and worship the branches of karam and sal. Girls celebrate the festival for welfare, friendship and sisterhood by exchanging a jawa flower.

Story behind the celebration
There are multiple versions of the story behind the origin of Karam Puja. Anthropologist Hari Mohan writes that after the rituals are over, the karam story is narrated to boys and girls. The story behind the festival, according to Mohan, is this:

Once upon a time there were seven brothers who labored hard at agriculture work. They had no time even for lunch; therefore, their wives carried their lunches to the field daily. Once it so happened that their wives did not bring the lunches for them. They were hungry. In the evening they returned home and found that their wives were dancing and singing near a branch of the karam tree in the court yard. This made them angry, and one of the brothers lost his temper. He snatched the karam branch and threw it into the river. The karam deity was insulted; as a result, the economic condition of their family continued to deteriorate and they were brought to the point of starvation. One day a Brahman (priest) came to them, and the seven brothers told him the whole story. The seven brothers then left the village in search of the Karam Rani. They kept on moving from place to place and, one day, they found the karam tree. Subsequently, they worshiped it and their economic condition began to improve.
Among the Bhumijs and the Oraons the legend is that there were seven brothers living together. The six oldest used to work in the field and the youngest stayed at home. He was indulging in dance and songs round a karam tree in the courtyard with his six sisters-in-law. One day, they were so engrossed in dance and song that the brothers' morning meal was not carried to the field by the wives. When the brothers arrived home, they became agitated and threw the karam tree into a river. The youngest brother left home in anger. Then evil days fell on the remaining brothers. Their house was damaged, the crops failed, and they virtually starved. While wandering, the youngest brother found the karam tree floating in the river. Then he propitiated the god, who restored everything. Thereafter he returned home and called his brothers and told them that because they insulted Karam Devta, they fell on evil days. Since then the Karam Devta has been worshipped.
Another legend prevalent among the Pauri Bhuiyans is that a merchant returned home after a very prosperous voyage. His vessel was loaded with precious metals and other valuables which he had brought from distant lands. He waited in the vessel to be ceremoniously received by his wife and relatives, as was the custom. As it was the day of the Karam festival, all the women were engrossed with dancing and the men with playing the drums, so no one came to receive him. The merchant became furious with them. He uprooted the karam tree and threw it away. Then the wrath of Karam Devta fell on him. His vessel immediately sank in the sea. The merchant consulted astrologers who told him to propitiate Karam Devta. He launched another vessel, set out in search of the deity, and found him floating in the sea. He propitiated him with great devotion and all his wealth was restored. From that day on, the annual festival of Karam Puja has been held. After spending the whole night with dance and songs, the people uproot the branches and carry them to nearby rivers or rivulets for immersion.

The Pahan places a water pot in Sarna and, on the following day, predicts the weather for the coming year. He also distributes Sal flowers among the villagers. People worship the souls of their ancestors at home and offer different types of food to them. Only after making these offerings do they eat. Afterward, they sing and dance to the beats of the Dhol, Nagara, and Mandar, while also drinking rice beer, Handia.

 
Since 1961, processions have been organized during the Sarhul festival in Ranchi and Gumla. Before that, there were no such processions; people only danced near Sarna sthal. In urban areas, middle-class tribal activists have reinvented the nature festival Sarhul to emphasize regional identity, while in rural areas, it remains primarily a thanksgiving ritual to the deities.

During this festival, people fast, paint their houses, and prepare food. At night, they light earthen lamps in the cattle sheds and offer sacrifices to Gaurea, the deity of animals.

Celebration
Sohrai is a harvest festival celebrated after the harvest. It is observed on Amavasya (new moon) in the Hindu month of Kartik (October–November). The festival is celebrated in honor of cattle, especially bullocks, buffaloes, goats, and sheep. On this day, people fast throughout the day, and earthen lamps are lit in homes, cattle sheds, kitchens, and gardens. On the festival day, the animals are bathed, and their horns and foreheads are anointed with vermilion diluted in oil. They are offered a special meal of rice and vegetables. In the evening, a black chicken is sacrificed to Gaurea (the spirit of the cowshed), along with Tapan (fermented rice drink). The meat of the sacrificed chicken is then eaten with bread and Tapan. Sohrai is a day to express gratitude and affection for livestock.
The harvest festival is also a time for people to showcase their artistic skills and expressions. Every year, after the festival is over, the drawings and patterns created during this time are erased. This festival usually takes place in October or November and lasts for three days. It coincides with Diwali. However, the Santals living in Santal Parganas celebrate it in January.

Arts

An indigenous art form is practised by the women. Ritualistic art is done on mud walls to welcome the harvest and to celebrate the cattle. The women clean their houses and decorate their walls with murals of Sohrai arts. This art form has continued since 10,000–4,000 BC. It was prevalent mostly in caves, but shifted to houses with mud walls.

This Sohrai art form can be monochromatic or colorful. The people coat the wall with a layer of white mud, and while the layer is still wet, they draw with their fingertips on it. Their designs range from flowers and fruits to various other nature-inspired designs. The cow dung that was earlier used to cake the walls of the house is used to add colour. The dark outline is visible due to the previously applied contrasting white mud coat. Sohrai artists are spontaneous in their drawing. Little pre-planning is evident. The canvases range up to 12 x 18 feet. The designs are usually drawn from the artist's memory. The personal experience of the artist and their interaction with nature are the biggest influence.

Herath (Shivaratri)
An interesting fact about Kashmiri Pandit festivals, needing investigation, is that some of these are celebrated a day ahead of their celebration by Hindus in other parts of the country. Shivaratri, regarded as the most important festival of the community, for instance, is celebrated by them on trayodashi or the thirteenth of the dark half of the month of Phalguna (February–March) and not on chaturdashi or the fourteenth as in the rest of the country. The reason for it is that this long drawn festival that is celebrated for one full fortnight as an elaborate ritual is associated with the appearance of Bhairava (Shiva) as a jwala-linga or a linga of flame. Called 'Herath' in Kashmiri, a word derived from the Sanskrit 'Hararatri' the 'Night of Hara' (another name of Shiva), it has been described as Bhairavotsava in Tantric texts as on this occasion Bhairava and Bhairavi, His Shakti or cosmic energy, are propitiated through Tantric worship. According to the legend associated with the origin of the worship, the linga appeared at pradoshakala or the dusk of early night as a blazing column of fire and dazzled Vatuka Bhairava and Rama (or Ramana) Bhairava, Mahadevi's mind-born sons, who approached it to discover its beginning or end but miserably failed. Exasperated and terrified they began to sing its praises and went to Mahadevi, who herself merged with the awe-inspiring jwala-linga. The Goddess blessed both Vatuka and Ramana that they would be worshipped by human beings and would receive their share of sacrificial offerings on that day and those who would worship them would have all their wishes fulfilled. As Vatuka Bhairava emerged from a pitcher full of water after Mahadevi cast a glance into it, fully armed with all his weapons (and so did Rama), he is represented by a pitcher full of water in which walnuts are kept for soaking and worshipped along with Shiva, Parvati, Kumara, Ganesha, their ganas or attendant deities, yoginis and kshetrapalas (guardians of the quarters) - all represented by clay images. The soaked walnuts are later distributed as naivedya. The ceremony is called 'vatuk barun' in Kashmiri, which means filling the pitcher of water representing the Vatuka Bhairava with walnuts and worshipping it.
The Poice dishes, mainly of meat and fish but also vegetarian as an option, are cooked as sacrificial food and partaken of by the worshipper and his family after being symbolically offered to the whole host of deities and attendant deities associated with Shivaratri. This is essential for everyone, the related texts emphasize. Those who do so are supposed to achieve progress and prosperity in life and have all their wishes fulfilled. But those who do not partake of the sacrificial food and do not break their fast after the Puja are bound to go to hell or take rebirth as lowly animals besides facing all kinds of disappointments in life, as related texts like the Shiva Samhita say:
""yo yagotsavam ulanghya tishthet nirashano vrato, jivan sa pashutameti mrito niryamapnuyat""
The symbolism of the aniconic earthen images, vagur, sonipotul and others representing Shiva, Ganesha, Parvati, yoginis and kshetrapalas, is not clear, as no available text has cared to have thrown any light on it. The vagur, specially worshipped on the dvadashi night itself, is perhaps a vestige of the rites of the Kaula cult as the manual on Shivaratri Puja suggests. It further indicates that these rites are related to Bhairava Puja: ""atha dvadashyam pujanam Bhairavam namami"", without elaborating. This has resulted in ridiculous etymologies of the names of the anicons being claimed by some people. The clay images are, nonetheless, essential to the performance of the ritual activity. As they are not made on the potter's wheel, their worship may have originated in an early period.
However, it is clear from what we have said above that there is difference in the way Shivaratri is celebrated by the Kashmiri Pandits and by Hindus elsewhere in the country. The Pandits not only celebrate it as Bhairavotsava one day earlier but also perform quite different rituals. Further, the tradition among Hindus in general is to strictly observe a fast on the Shiva Chaturdashi day. Even taking fruit or betel leaf is considered as violation of the fast.
""Shivayaga chaturdashyam ma vrate phala bhojanam"", says the Padma Purana. The Markandeya Purana going a step ahead adds: ""tambulam api na dadyat vrata bhanga bhayam priye"". It is not that the Kashmiri Pandits do not celebrate on the chaturdshi day, but it is a day of feasting for them. The Nilamata Purana, it may be noted, clearly says that Shivaratri is celebrated on the chaturdashi of the dark fortnight of Phalguna.

Khetchmaavas
There are several other festivals and Puja rites peculiar to Kashmiri Pandits, some of them dating back to hoary antiquity. One such distinctly Kashmiri festival is Khetsimavas or Yakshamavasya which is celebrated on the amavasya or the last day of the dark fortnight of Pausha (December–January). Commemorative of the coming together and co-mingling of various races and ethnic groups in prehistoric Kashmir, khichari is offered on this day as sacrificial food to Kubera indicating that the cult of Yaksha existed there from very early times. Khetsimavas appears to be a folk-religious festival - a pestle, or any stone in case that is not available, is washed and anointed with sandalwood paste and vermilion on this evening and worshipped taking it to be an image of Kubera. Khichari is offered to him with naivedya mantras and a portion of it is kept on the outer wall of his house by the worshipper in the belief that Yaksha will come to eat it.

Navreh
Kashmiri Pandits celebrate their New Year's Day on the first day of the bright half of the month of Chaitra (Mar–Apr) and call it Navreh- the word derived from the Sanskrit nava varsha, literary meaning 'new year'. The Kashmiri Pandit families that migrated to the plains before 1900 also celebrate Navreh. On the eve of Navreh, a platter of unhusked rice with a bread, a cup of curd, a little salt, a little sugar candy, a few walnuts or almonds, a silver coin, a pen, a mirror, some flowers (rose, marigold, crocus, or jasmine) and the new panchanga or almanac is kept and seen as the first thing on waking up in the morning. This ritual is more or less the same as the Iranian Haft-Seen and Zoroastrian Nowruz. The Bhringisha Samhita says that the platter should be of bronze (kansyapatraka). The same ritual is observed on Sonth or the Kashmiri spring festival.
The Saptarshi Era of the Kashmiri Hindu calendar is believed to have started on this very day, some 5079 years ago. According to the legend, the celebrated Sapta Rishis assembled on the Sharika Parvata (Hari Parbat), the abode of the goddess Sharika, at the auspicious moment when the first ray of the sun fell on the Chakreshvara on this day and paid tribute to her. Astrologers made this moment as the basis of their calculations of the nava varsha pratipada, marking the beginning of the Saptarshi Era. Before their exodus Kashmiri Pandits would flock to Hari Parbat in thousands to celebrate Navreh.

Zyeth Atham
On Zyeth Atham (Jyeshtha Ashtami in Sanskrit) or the eighth day of the bright half of Jyeshtha (May–June) a grand festival is held at Tulmul to celebrate the pradurbhava of the Goddess Ragya (Kshir Bhavani). Another festival is held at the shrine on Ashadha Ashtami with equal devotional fervour, the sacred spring of the shrine that miraculously changes its colour having been discovered on the saptami of that month. The devotees offer their worship, individually or in groups, waving lamp (Deep) and burning incense (dhupa) while reciting hymns to the Goddess and singing devotional songs. They make offerings of khir to her and of milk, loaf-sugar and flowers, which they offer into the spring. Ritually no specific procedure is prescribed for the Puja at Kshir Bhavani. The Bhringish Samhita simply says that the Devi, whose mantra is of fifteen syllables, accepts offerings of milk, sugar candy and ghee only - ""sa kshira-kharuladi bhojanam"".

Tiky Tsoram
Tripura Sundari, literally meaning ""she who is lovely in the three worlds"", is one of the most important goddesses worshipped in the Tantric tradition in Kashmir. Her cult is particularly popular among the Tiku clan of Kashmiri Pandits who celebrate her festival on Tiky chorum(4th.maag one day before Vasant Panchami)
. The surname 'Tiku' is derived from ""trika"", according to popular etymology. Her devotees believe that she combines in her form all three Goddesses, Mahalakshmi, Maha-sarswati and Mahakali, and all three of her cosmic functions. However, she is also worshipped by the entire Brahmin community in Kashmir and from very early times.

Pann
Pann (literally meaning thread) is a festival originally associated with the spinning of newly produced cotton and worshipping the twin agricultural goddesses, obviously local, Vibha and Garbha to whom roths or sweet bread cakes were offered. Though Kashmir is not said to have a climate suitable for growing cotton, there is a strong tradition suggesting that it actually did grow there. The festival falls on the Ganesh Chaturthi (Vinayaka Tsoram) day and the worship of Lakshmi on this occasion seems to have been inducted later. Not that the worship dedicated to the local goddesses was appropriated wilfully by followers of the cult of Lakshmi, but there appears to have been a mix-up at some point of time. The twin goddesses themselves seem to have merged into one another assuming the identity of the folk deity Beeb Garabh Maj, whose very name- obviously a distortion - points to such a possibility. Beeb Garabh Maj is represented by a lota or a water pot which is placed in the centre of the place where the Puja is to be performed, a cotton thread (Pann) being tied to its neck and handful of dramun or runner grass kept inside it, pointing again to its agricultural origin. A story is told at the Pann Puja which is quite similar to the Satyanaryana Katha, showing some sort of confusion between two different Pujas. Preparation of the roths and their distribution for ushering in prosperity and auspiciousness has, however, become an important part of Kashmiri Pandit religious life.

Gaad Batt
Gaad Baat (literally meaning 'Fish and Rice') is another festival for Kashmiri Pandits which focusses on the dependence of Kashmiri Pandit festivals on the sacrificial offerings. This ritual is basically for the Guardian of the House, locally called as Gar Divta, for which the sacrificial offering of fish is offered. According to Kashmiri Pandits, Gar Divta has been perceived by many acts. Some people were even said to have communicated with Him. Gaad Batt is celebrated by having the fish sacrifice worshipped and offering the served rice-and-fish to Gar Divta, keeping it at a place that could be kept inaccessible for a night. He is known to keep our house away from evil spirits and protect us.

Ksheer Bhawani Mela
Ksheer Bhawani also known as Kheer Bhawani is a temple shrine in Kashmir dedicated to Goddess Bhawani (Durga). The temple is constructed over a sacred spring; legend has it the water in the spring kept on changing when there's some danger in the valley Kashmiri Pandits has a keen belief in the Kheer Bhawani Temple. The temple is also linked with the great Indian epic Ramayana. It is believed that it was Lord Hanumana who brought Goddess Kheer Bhawani in Kashmir along with the Nagas. The temple is situated in the Tulmul village of Kashmir. Every year a grand fair is organised and pilgrims usually Kashmiri Pandits come to pay their obeisance to Goddess Bhawani. Also, a grand temple is built in Jammu in the Janipur area in accordance with the Kheer Bhawani temple of Kashmir. A grand fest is also organised in Jammu as well.

Ancient Kashmiri Pandit festivals
Till the 11th century AD, the Kashmiri Pandits celebrated Mitra (Mithra) Punim, on the fourteenth (full moon) night of the bright fortnight (shukla paksha) of the Hindu autumn month of Ashvin or Ashwayuja. On this night, they remembered Mitra (Mithra), the patron divinity of honesty, friendship, contracts and meetings, by lighting a diya for him. The next morning was called Mitra Prabhat (Bamdad-e-Mithra), or the Morning of Mitra. Lotuses, rose petals and marigolds, washed in the water of the rivers Vitasta (now called Vyeth or Jhelum), along with walnuts, fruits and milk or milk-based sweets, were kept on a decorated platter in the honor of Mithra. Children were bathed in the same Vitasta(Vyeth) river and dressed in bright red, orange, or yellow silk robes, representing the radiance of Mithra's glory. Games were organized for children so that they were encouraged to forge new friendships. Clothes and quilts were donated to the needy and the fruits, nuts, and milk-sweets placed on the Mithra platter were shared with them. Nadir (lotus stem) was cooked on this day. In the Vedas, mitra also refers to the morning sun.

It takes place on the first day of the bright half (Shukla Paksha) on the month of Chaitra (March–April) of the Kashmiri Hindu calendar.

History
According to the legend, Mother Goddess Sharika's dwelling was on Sharika Parvata (Hari Parbat) where the celebrated Sapta Rishis gathered. On an auspicious day of 1st Chaitra, as the first ray of sun fell on Chakreshwari and paid honor to her. This moment is considered the beginning of New Year and the Saptarishi era for astrologers. Kashmiri Hindu Tradition and astronomical calculations date the beginning of this era to 3076 BC.

Rituals
On the eve of the new year, the priest (kulguru) of the family provides a religious almanac (nachipatra) for the next year and a scroll (kreel pach) of the local goddess. Then a customary large plate (thali) is filled with rice and offerings like almanac, scroll, dried and fresh flowers, wye herb, new grass, curd, walnuts, pen, ink container, gold and silver coins, salt, cooked rice, wheat cakes and bread and covered on the eve of Navreh. On the day of the new year, the family members gather together, uncover the thali and view it on the holy day.
The rice and coins represent our daily bread and wealth, the pen and paper a reminder of the quest for learning, the mirror represents retrospection.
The calendar signals the changing time and the Deity the Universal Constant, and they together are a reminder of the constancy of changing time. The bitter herb is reminiscent of life's bitter aspects, to be taken in stride alongside the good. The bitter herb ‘wye’ is usually eaten with walnuts to bring wholeness of life's experiences in the admixture.
Symbolism aside, the consumption of this bitter herb has also been practiced by Native American cultures as well as by some of the American transcendentalist philosophers for various reasons.
After seeing (darshan) the thali, each person takes a walnut to be thrown into a river  The walnuts from the thali are dropped in the river as a sign of thanksgiving. Then the family members offer turmeric rice in ghee (tahar) to the goddess at the temple and seek blessings.

A major annual event for Keralites, it is the official festival of the state and includes a spectrum of cultural events.

Hindu Mythology
Onam commemorates the return of the generous daitya king Mahabali after he was banished to the netherworld by Vamana (the fifth avatar of Hindu deity Vishnu). According to the Hindu legends, after Indra (the king of the devas) is defeated by Mahabali (the king of the asuras), the devas ultimately seek refuge in Vishnu, who agrees to restore Indra to power. To do so, Vishnu incarnates as a dwarf priest called Vamana. The king Mahabali (himself a devotee of Vishnu) conducts ritual prayers, one of which is attended by Vamana, who requests only three feet (steps) of land to build a fire-altar. Mahabali agrees, despite being told about Vamana's divine nature by the sage Shukra. Vamana grows in size, and in three strides, encompasses all of the universe and beyond. The three worlds are restored to Indra, and Mahabali and the asuras are banished to the netherworld (Patala). However, witnessing Mahabali's love for his subjects, Vamana grants the king's sole wish to visit his kingdom once every year. This homecoming of Mahabali is celebrated as Onam in Kerala every year.
The date of Onam celebration is based on the Panchangam, and falls on the 22nd nakshatra Thiruvonam in the month Chingam of Malayalam calendar, which in Gregorian calendar falls between August–September.

History
The festival has ancient origins and is intricately linked with Hindu mythology. Literary and epigraphical evidence suggests that Onam has a long religious context and history in Kerala and neighbouring parts of South India:

The earliest known reference to the word Onam as a celebration is found in Maturaikkāñci – a Sangam era Tamil poem from the 3rd century CE. It mentions a festival called Onam being celebrated in dedication to Mayon (Vishnu) in Madurai, when games and duels were held in temple premises, oblations were sent to the temples, people wore new clothes and feasted.
The 8th-century Alvar mystic saint Nammalvar mentions of the one who measured the three worlds, a parallel to the legend of Mahabali and Vamana.
The 9th-century Pathikas and Pallads by Periyalvar describes Onam celebrations and offerings to Vishnu, mentions feasts and community events.
An 11th-century inscription in the Thrikkakara Temple (Kochi) dedicated to Vamana – an avatar of Vishnu – mentions a series of offerings made by a votary over two days prior and on Thiru Onam.
A 12th-century inscription in the Tiruvalla Temple, one of the largest Hindu temples in Kerala dedicated to Vishnu, mentions Onam and states a donation was made to the temple as the Onam festival offering.
Uddanda Shastri, a southern Indian Sanskrit poet visiting the court of the Zamorin, has written about a festival called śrāvaṇa. It is presumed that this verse is about the festival of Onam as the word Onam (or Thiruvonam) is the Tamil/Malayalam form of the śrāvaṇa nakshatra mentioned in Indian astronomy:
चोकुयन्ते पृथुकततयश्चापतादिन्य उच्चैः सर्वानार्यःपतिभिरनिशम् लम्भयन्त्यर्थकामान्।
बभ्रम्यन्ते सकलपुरुषैर्वल्लभाभ्यः प्रदातुम् चित्रम् वस्त्रम् श्रावणकुतुकम् वर्तते केरळेषु॥

Gangs of lads, playing their bows hoot loudly again and again; All women make their husbands provide wealth and pleasure; All men are wandering hither and thither to present beautiful garments to their women. The festivity of 'Sravana' takes place in Kerala.
A 16th-century European memoir describes Onam. It mentions among other things that Onam is always celebrated in September, the Malayali people adorn their homes with flowers and daub them over with cow's dung believing its auspicious association with goddess Lakshmi.
According to Kurup, Onam has been historically a Hindu temple-based community festival celebrated over a period of many days.

Significance
Onam is an ancient Hindu festival of Kerala that celebrates rice harvest. The significance of the festival is in Indian culture, of which two are more common.

Mahabali and Vamana
According to Hindu mythology, Mahabali was the great-great-grandson of a Brahmin sage named Kashyapa, the great-grandson of a demonic dictator, Hiranyakashipu, and the grandson of Vishnu devotee Prahlada. This links the festival to the Puranic story of Prahlada of Holika fame in Hinduism, who was the son of Hiranyakashipu. Prahlada, despite being born to a demonic Asura father who hated Vishnu, rebelled against his father's persecution of people and worshipped Vishnu. Hiranyakashipu tries to kill his son Prahlada, but is slain by Vishnu in his Narasimha avatar, Prahlada is saved.

Prahlada's grandson, Mahabali, came to power by defeating the gods (Devas) and taking over the three worlds. According to Vaishnavism, the defeated Devas approached Vishnu for help in their battle with Mahabali. Vishnu refused to join the gods in violence against Mahabali because Mahabali was a good ruler and his own devotee. Mahabali, after his victory over the gods, declared that he would perform a Yajna (homa sacrifices/rituals) and grant anyone any request during the Yajna. Vishnu took the avatar – his fifth – of a dwarf monk called Vamana and approached Mahabali. The king offered anything to the boy – gold, cows, elephants, villages, food, whatever he wished. The boy said that one must not seek more than one needs, and all he needed was ""three paces of land."" Mahabali agreed.
Vamana grew to an enormous size and covered everything Mahabali ruled over in just two paces. For the third pace, Mahabali offered his head for Vishnu to step on, an act that Vishnu accepted as evidence of Mahabali's devotion. Vishnu granted him a boon, by which Mahabali could visit again, once every year, the lands and people he previously ruled. This revisit marks the festival of Onam, as a reminder of the virtuous rule and his humility in keeping his promise before Vishnu. The last day of Mahabali's stay is remembered with a nine-course vegetarian Onasadya feast.

The name Thrikkakara is originated from 'Thiru-kaal-kara' meaning 'place of the holy foot'. The main deity at Thrikkakara Temple is Vamana, the smaller temple to the side has Shiva as the deity. Vamana temple is known as 'Vadakkum Devar' and the Shiva temple is known as 'Tekkum Devar'. A number of subsidiary deities have been installed at Thrikkakara Temple. The 1961 census report on Onam festival states:Though the Vamana temple is accepted as the main temple at the elite level, the local people consider the Shiva temple as the more important one. They believe that Shiva was the 'Kuladeivam' (family deity) of Mahabali and that there was no Vamana temple at that time. The palace of Mahabali was situated at the place where the Vamana temple is at present. After the fall of Mahabali, his palace was destroyed and later on Vamana was installed on that spot by the saint Kapila.According to Nanditha Krishna, a simpler form of this legend, one without Mahabali, is found in the Rigveda and the Vedic text Shatapatha Brahmana where a solar deity is described with powers of Vishnu. This story likely grew over time, and is in part allegorical, where Bali is a metaphor for thanksgiving offering after a bounty of rice harvest during monsoon, and Vishnu is the metaphor of the Kerala sun and summer that precedes the Onam. According to Roshen Dalal, the story of Mahabali is important to Onam in Kerala, but similar Mahabali legends are significant in the region of Balia and Bawan in Uttar Pradesh, Bharuch in Gujarat, and Mahabaleshwar in Maharashtra. The story is significant not because Mahabali's rule ended, but it emphasises the Hindu belief in cyclical nature of events, that no individual, no ruler and nothing lasts forever, except the virtues and self-understanding that overcomes all sorrow.

Parashurama
An alternate tale behind Onam relates to Parashurama, an incarnation of Vishnu who is credited in Hinduism to have created the Western Ghats and Kerala. According to this legend, Vishnu observed the kings of the Kshatriya (warrior) waging constant war on one another and growing arrogant. He assumed the avatar of Parashurama, the warrior sage, in the era of the king Kartavirya Arjuna. This king persecuted and oppressed the people, the sages, and the gods. Following the murder of his father Jamadagni, Parashurama swore vengeance against the king and the warrior class, slaying them as he travelled the world. When all the oppressors had been vanquished, he threw his axe into the ocean. The ocean retreated from the region where the axe descended, creating the land of Kerala. The Onam festival, according to this legend, celebrates Parashurama's creation of Kerala by marking those days as the new year.
The legend and worship of Parashurama is attested in texts and epigraphs dated to about the 2nd century CE.

Cultural festival
Onam is a ""popular major Hindu festival in Kerala"", states Christine Frost, but one that is also celebrated by other communities with ""much zest alongside Hindus"". The festival is celebrated in BECs (Basic Ecclesial communities) in Trivandrum with local rituals, according to Latin Catholic Bishop Selvister Ponnumuthan. These traditions, according to Selvister Ponnumuthan, start with the lighting of Nilavilakku, an arati that includes waving of flowers (pushparati) over the Bible, eating the Onam meal together with the Hindus as a form of ""communion of brothers and sisters of different faiths"". The significance of these practices are viewed by BECs in Trivandrum as a form of integration with Hindus, mutual respect and sharing a tradition.

Paulinus of St. Bartholomew (1748–1806), in his 'A voyage to the East Indies' describes Onam as :The fourth grand festival, celebrated in Malayala, is called Onam, and happens always in the month of September, on the day of new moon (not always). About the 10th of September the rain ceases in Malabar. All nature seems as if regenerated; the flowers again shoot up, and the trees bloom, in a word, this season is the same as that which Europeans call spring. This festival seems, therefore, to have been instituted for the purpose of soliciting from the Gods a happy and fruitful year. It continues eight days and during that time the Indians are accustomed to adorn their houses with flowers and daub them over with cow's dung; because the cow, as already observed, is a sacred animal dedicated to the Goddess Lakshmi, the Ceres of the Indians. On this occasion they also put on new clothes throw aside all their old earthenware and supply its place by new. The men, particularly those who are young, form themselves into two parties and shoot at each other with arrows. These arrows are blunted, but exceedingly strong, and are discharged with such force, that a considerable number are generally wounded on both sides. These games have a great likeness to the Cerealia and Juvenalia of the ancient Greeks and Romans.

Onam and Islam
According to P.S. Salini, a research scholar in Islamic studies, most Muslims join the festivities with their friends and celebrate ""Hindu festivals such as Onam"". According to a 2001 chapter by Filippo Osella and Caroline Osella, both Hindus and non-Hindus have celebrated Onam equally ""as a time when the unity of the family and kin group is particularly emphasized"". In another 2008 paper, Osella and Osella states that ""Onam is not celebrated by Muslims"" and the Muslims who do prepare an Onam feast have an air of a ""daring secret"".
Some Muslim Indian politicians light a traditional vilakku (oil lamp), while others have refused to light such a lamp at Onam events declaring it to be a Hindu tradition and against the teachings of Islam. Muslim daily newspapers and other publications have condemned Muslim ministers who participate in Onam traditions.
Various sections of Islam have raised concerns about the celebration of Onam by Muslims. However some Muslims observe Onam anyway, considering its celebrations and rituals as a cultural practice.

Celebrations, rituals and practices
Onam falls in the month of Chingam, which is the first month according to the Malayalam Calendar. The celebrations mark the Malayalam New Year, are spread over ten days, and conclude with Thiruvonam. The ten days are sequentially known as Atham, Chithira, Chodhi, Vishakam, Anizham, Thriketa, Moolam, Pooradam, Uthradam and Thiruvonam. The first and the last day are particularly important in Kerala and to Malayalee communities elsewhere.
The Atham day is marked with the start of festivities at Thrikkakara Vamanamoorthy Temple, Kochi. This Vishnu temple is considered as the focal centre of Onam and the abode of Mahabali, with the raising of the festival flag. Parades are held, which are colourful and depict the elements of Kerala culture with floats and tableaux.
Other days have a diverse range of celebrations and activities ranging from boat races, cultural programs, sports competitions, dance events, martial arts, floral Rangoli – pookkalam, prayers, shopping, donating time or food for charity to spending time with family over feasts. Men and women wear traditional dress. The Kerala sari or Kasavu sari is particularly wore on this day.

Athachamayam
The Onam celebrations across the state starts off with a grand procession at Thrippunithura near Kochi called Atthachamayam, also referred to as Thripunithura Athachamayam. The parade features decorated elephants marching, drum beats and other music, folk art forms, floats and colourfully dressed people with masks. In Kerala's history, the Kochi king used to head a grand military procession in full ceremonial robes from his palace to the Thrikkakara temple, meeting and greeting his people. In contemporary times, this a state-supported event.
The parade floats traditionally feature scenes from epics such as the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. Additionally, some floats include themes from the Bible as well as current themes thereby highlighting unity and harmony.
The procession path historically has been from Tripunithura to the Vamanamoorthy Temple in Thrikkakara, Ernakulam district. The temple is dedicated to Vishnu in his Vamana (dwarf) avatar. After arrival at the temple, the marchers offer a prayer.

Pookkalam (Flower Rangoli)
The floral Rangoli, known as Onapookkalam, Athapookkalam or just Pookkalam, is made out of the gathered blossoms with several varieties of flowers of differing tints pinched up into little pieces to design and decorate patterns on the floor, particularly at entrances and temple premises like a flower mat. Lamps are arranged in the middle or edges. It is a work of religious art, typically the team initiative of girls and women, who accomplish it with a delicate touch and a personal artistic sense of tone and blending. When completed, a miniature pandal (umbrella) hung with little festoons is erected over it. The pookkalam is similar to Rangoli which is made of powders of various colours and is popular in North India.
The traditional ritual of laying pookkalam (floral Rangoli) starts on Atham day. The pookkalam on this day is called Athapoo, and it is relatively small in size. The size of the pookkalam grows in size progressively with each day of the Onam festival. Only yellow flowers will be used on Atham with only one circular layer made and the design is kept simple. Statues or figurines of Mahabali and Vamana are also installed at the entrance of each house on this day.
Traditionally, Atthapookalams included flowers endemic to Kerala and the Dashapushpam (10-flowers), but nowadays all varieties of flowers are used. Earthen mounds, which look somewhat like square pyramids, representing Mahabali and Vamana are placed in the dung-plastered courtyards in front of the house along with the Pookalam, and beautifully decorated with flowers. All over Kerala, Pookalam competitions are a common sight on Onam day.

Music and dance
Traditional dance forms including Thiruvathira, Kummattikali, Pulikali, Thumbi Thullal, Onam Kali and others. Thiruvathira Kali is a women's dance performed in a circle around a lamp. Kummattikali is a colourful-mask dance. In Thrissur, festivities include a procession consisting of caparisoned elephants surrounded by Kummatikali dancers. The masked dancers go from house to house performing the colourful Kummattikali. Onam Kali is a form of dance where players arrange themselves in circles around a pole or tree or lamp, then dance and sing songs derived from the Ramayana and other epics.

Kathakali dance is also commonly performed during this time, with dancers enacting characters from the various Ancient Indian legends. A famous venue for this is at Valluvanad which is associated with the growth of Kathakali, and Cheruthuruthy, where Kerala Kalamandalam is located.

Pulikali: tiger dance
Pulikali, also known as Kaduvakali is a common sight during the Onam season. This dance showcases performers painted like tigers in bright yellow, red and black, who dance to the beats of instruments like Chenda and Thakil. This folk art is mainly performed in the cultural district of Thrissur and thousands pour into the city to be a part of this art.
Performances of the ritual worship dance, Theyyam, are given during the Onam season. In this, Mahabali is played by the Onathar. Its variations include characters such as Oneswaran and Onapottan.
At the Thrikkakara temple, every day of the festival showcases one or more of these activities including Kathakali, Thiruvathira, Chakyar Koothu, Ottam Thullal, Patakam, Onam songs, and percussion instrument shows. The Onasadya here is grand in scale, and is attended by over ten thousand people from all religions and faiths. Festivities include Puli Kali (masked leopard dance) and traditional dance forms like Kaikotti Kali which are performed in various functions. The official Government celebrations start on this day with heavy illuminations in Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Kozhikode along with fireworks.
Most cities in Kerala, such as the political, commercial and cultural capitals, Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Thrissur, are lit up with lights and fabulous displays of fireworks. Sumptuous Onam Sadya feasts are prepared. In Thrikkakara temple, a mega-feast is conducted, which is open to the public and is attended by more than twenty thousand people.

Vallamkali: boat race
The Vallamkali (the snake boat race) is another event that is synonymous with Onam. Well-known races include the  Aranmula Uthrattadhi Boat Race and the Nehru Trophy Boat Race. Numerous oarsmen row huge snake-shaped boats. Men and women come from far and near to watch and cheer the snake boat race through the water. This event is particularly featured on the Pampa River, considered sacred and Kerala equivalent of Ganges River.
As a tribute to the traditional snake boat race, a similar snake boat race is also held by the Malayali diaspora in Singapore annually during Onam at the Jurong Lake.

Onam Sadya
The Onam sadya (feast) is another indispensable part of Onam, and almost every Keralite either makes or attends one. The Onasadya reflects the spirit of the season and is traditionally made with seasonal vegetables such as yam, cucumber, ash gourd and so on. The feast is served on plantain leaves and consists of nine courses, but may include over two dozen dishes, including (but not limited to): Chips (especially Banana chips), Sharkaraveratti (Fried pieces of banana coated with jaggery), Pappadam, various vegetable and soups such as Injipuli (also called PuliInji), Thoran, Mezhukkupuratti, Kaalan, Olan, Avial, Sambhar, Dal served along with a small quantity of ghee, Erisheri, Molosyam, Rasam, Puliseri (also referred to as Velutha curry), Kichadi (not to be confused with Khichdi) and Pachadi (its sweet variant), Moru (buttermilk or curd mixed with water), Pickles both sweet and sour, and coconut chutney. The feast ends with a series of dessert called Payasam (a sweet dish made of milk, sugar, jaggery, and other traditional Indian savouries) eaten either straight or mixed with ripe small plantain. The curries are served with rice, usually the 'Kerala Matta' parboiled rice preferred in Kerala.
In hotels and temples, the number of curries and dishes may go up to 30. The importance of the feast to Kerala's Onam celebration culture is captured in the famous Malayalam proverb ""Kaanam Vittum Onam Unnanam"" which means ""One must have the Onam lunch even by selling one's property if need be."" The Travancore-style Onasadya is renowned to be the most disciplined and tradition-bound.
The Kurichians tribe of Parambikkulam celebrate Onam as a festival for eating new grains. Just before Onam, they go for a community hunt and the game bagged during the hunt are distributed among participants and consumed in family feasts. The feasts are held on Uthradam and Thiruvonam. Their feast also include fish and meat.

Post Onam celebrations
Normally, the largest chunk of Onam celebrations ends by Thiruvonam. However, the two days following Thiruvonam are also celebrated as Third and Fourth Onam. The third Onam, called Avvittom marks the preparations for King Mahabali's return ascension to heavens. The main ritual of the day is to take the Onathappan statue which was placed in the middle of every Pookkalam during the past 10 days and immerse it in nearby rivers or sea. The Pookkalam will be cleaned and removed after this ritual.

Other customs
People buy and wear new clothes for the occasion of Onam, called Onakkodi.
During the Onam, Keralite Hindus install an image of Thrikkakara Appan or Onatthappan (Vishnu in the form of Vamana) in their home just as Hindus install images or murtis of Lord Ganesha on the Ganesha Chaturthi festival elsewhere.
Many lamps are lit in Hindu temples of Kerala during this celebration. A palmyra tree is erected in front of temples and surrounded by a wooden balustrade and covered with dry palmyra leaves. It is lit with a torch and burned to ashes to signify that King Mahabali went to Patala as a sacrifice.
The swing is another integral part of Onam, especially in rural areas. Young men and women, decked in their best, sing Onappaatt, or Onam songs, and rock one another on swings slung from high branches.
Onam season is often associated with creativity as weavers and potters go for excess production to cater to increased demands for their products during the season, especially in the North Kerala regions of Kannur and Kasargod. Handloom fairs are an integral part of the spirit of Onam festivities these days.
In some parts of Kerala, people indulge in various games and dances during and post-Thiruvonam. These are known as Onakkalikal. These include competitions such as Ox races (Maramadimatsaram), Uriyady, food-eating competitions, Pookalam competitions etc.in a special month.
Kuravans of Travancore use Onam as a day for offering thanks to their ancestral spirits. On Uthradam day, they offer liquor, rice cakes, flattened and parched rice, incense, camphor, etc. to the spirits. The ritual ends with a request to the spirits to be satisfied with their offerings and assured that the next attempt would be better. Then an appeal is made to protect the believers and to ward off evil spirits from their area. This ritual is locally known as kalayam vaikkal. A similar offering like this is done during Makaram harvest, known as Uchara.

Outside India
Onam is also celebrated by the worldwide Malayali diaspora. Celebrations are notable in Oman, Malaysia, Switzerland, the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and France (notably Paris and Marseille).

Pindikuthi Perunnal is the Saint Thomas Christian counterpart of Denha (Baptism of Jesus) in Eastern church and Epiphany in Western Church. The liturgical season Denha Kaalam (Epiphany season) begins with the Sunday nearest to Pindikuthi Perunnal.

Etymology
The term Pindikuthi is a compound Malayalam word composed of pindi (പിണ്ടി) which means ""trunk of the plantain tree"" and kuthi (കുത്തി) which is the past simple form of kuthal that means ""to prick or pierce"". Therefore, Pindikuthi means ""to prick or pierce the plantain trunk"". Rakkuli literally means ""bath in the night""

Celebrations, rituals and practices
A specially decorated plantain trunk is erected in front of houses with many torches attached to it. On the previous night of Denha celebration, family members used to go around it singing a Syriac hymn ""El Payya"", which means ""God is radiant"". Special dishes are prepared during this time, especially meat dishes. Some parishes organise competitions for the best decorated plantain. There are special prayers conducted in certain churches.
Saint Thomas Christians certain areas such as Palai and Pulincunnoo used to perform a ritual bath (in imitation of the Baptism of Jesus Christ in the River Jordan) on the previous night (ravu) of the feast of Denha in the rivers flowing near the churches in these localities after the solemn celebration of Ramsha, the Evening Liturgy.
Pindikuthi Perunnal (sometimes erroneously called Pindi Perunnal) is a prominent celebration in areas such as Irinjalakuda and Kunnamkulam. Most of the people in Irinjalakuda regardless the caste and creed await the festival for at least two or three months in advance. The main celebrations will start on the morning of previous day.

Vishu falls on the first day of the month of Medam in the Solar calender used in Malabar of Kerala (April 14 or 15 in the Gregorian calendar), signifying the solar new year as the sun moves into the zodiac sign of Aries. It is the traditional new year, while the Kollam era calendar, which was later formed at Kollam, new year falls on the 1st Chingham (August 16 or 17).
Vishu falls either on the same day or near April 14/15 as other new years in parts of India where the sun's path is followed, such as in states like Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Bengal, Northeast India, Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, and Jammu. Additionally, the Songkran festival of South East Asia also falls on the Vishu date, with the significance of the Kanikonna as part of Laos new year same like of Vishu celebrations in Kerala.The Sinhalese New Year in Sri Lanka also coincides with the Vishu date, sharing similar traditions such as the Vishu Kani, flower blossoms, traditional foods, and fireworks
The festival is marked by family time, preparing colourful auspicious items and viewing these as the first thing on the Vishu day (Vishukkani). In particular, Malayalis seek to view the golden blossoms of the Indian laburnum (Kani Konna), money or silver items, cloth (pattu), mirror, rice, coconut, cucumber, fruits and other harvest products. Days before Vishu, people start bursting fireworks at their houses and it concludes with lot of fireworks on day of Vishu. People wear new clothes (Kodi) and they eat a feast called Sadhya.

Etymology and origin
Vishu, from Sanskrit Viṣuvam, literally means 'equal', and it connoted to the celebration of spring equinox in the past. The spring equinox however occurs 24 days before the day of Vishu, on 21 March/Meenam 7, due to precession of equinoxes.

Religious significance
Vishu marks the first day of the astronomical year, a celebration of new beginnings and prosperity. A key tradition during Vishu is the vishukani, a carefully arranged collection of auspicious items such as fruits, flowers, coins, and gold.

Practices
Vishukkani
The Malayalam word ""kani"" literally means ""that which is seen first,"" so ""Vishukkani"" means ""that which is seen first on Vishu."" The traditional belief is that one's future is a function of what one experiences and that the new year will be better if one views auspicious, joyful things as the first thing on Vishu. Therefore, Malayalis spend the day before preparing a setting, usually a tray, of auspicious items. This setting is the first thing they see when they wake up on the Vishu day.
The Vishukkani setting consists of items such as rice, golden lemon, golden cucumber, coconut cut open, jack fruit, Kanmashi, betel leaves, arecanut, Aranmula kannadi (Vaalkannadi), golden colour Konna flowers (Cassia fistula) which bloom in the season of Vishu, nilavilakku, idol of Vishnu or his incarnation Krishna, and other auspicious items. Mirror in Vishukani is a symbol of seeing yourself as a part of abundance you see in the form of Kani.
One of the Vishu related devotional songs (also popularised as a song from the 1962 Malayalam movie 'Omanakkuttan') that communicate the glory of Krishna in his childhood form, begins with the following lines:
കണികാണും നേരം കമലാനേത്രന്റെ
നിറമേറും മഞ്ഞത്തുകിൽ ചാർത്തീ
കനകക്കിങ്ങിണി വളകൾ മോതിരം
അണിഞ്ഞു കാണേണം ഭഗവാനേ
(Oh Lotus-eyed, during the vision of Kani, let You be seen adorned with the increasingly glowing yellow costume and the bangles, bells and rings of gold.)
The tradition is that elders light the lamps after waking up, then wakes up juniors in the family. As soon as you wake up, you walk to the kani eyes closed, and sees Kani as the first scene of the year. The same tradition is followed in Kongu Nadu region on Puthandu day.
Traditionally, the vegetables, fruits, nuts, etc. that are included in Vishukkani are usually those that are home-grown - coconut, cucumber, mango, pineapple, jackfruit, betel-leaves, arecanut, etc. Kanikonna (Golden Showers) is one of the trees that is planted in the home-ground and community-grounds, and they blossom during the time of Vishu. It is also during the time of Vishu, that people lend their ears to the calls of Vishupakshi.

Vishu Sadhya
The Sadhya (feast) is a major part of all Kerala festivals, special dishes called Vishu Kanji, Thoran and Vishu katta are also made. The Kanji is made of rice, coconut milk and spices. Vishu katta is a delicacy prepared from freshly harvested rice powder and coconut milk served with jaggery. For Thoran, the side dish, there are also mandatory ingredients. Other important Vishu delicacies include Veppampoorasam (a bitter preparation of neem) and Mampazhappulissery (a sour or ripe mango soup) Even temple offerings called bewu bella, include a mix of sweet jaggery, bitter neem, and other flavors.
The mixing of sweet, salty, sour, bitter and astringent flavors for the new year Vishu meal is similar to the pacchadi food prepared on new year day such as Ugadi by Hindus in Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in the Indian subcontinent. These traditional festive recipes, that combine different flavors, are a symbolic reminder that one must expect all flavors of experiences in the coming new year, that no event or episode is wholly sweet or bitter, experiences are transitory and ephemeral, and to make the most from them.

Padakkam
The word 'Padakkam' in Malayalam means firecrackers. Firecrackers are burst during Vishu the same way north Indians burst firecrackers during Diwali.

Konna
Konna (Cassia fistula), commonly known as golden shower is the flower of the Vishu festival.

Other customs
The tradition of buying of new clothes for the occasion of Vishu is called Puthukodi or Vishukodi. There is also a popular tradition of elders giving money to younger ones or dependents of the family. This is called Vishukkaineetam. Another tradition is of giving alms and contributing to community charity. Children enjoy setting off firecrackers. Kaineettam literally means 'extension of hand'. As seen in many Hindu expressions of good-will, charity and philanthropy, and sustenance of dharma, the kaineettam usually ends with the numerical 1, indicating a new beginning, while also a continuation. For example, Vishukkaineettam is gifted in amounts such as Rs 11, Rs 21, Rs 51, 101, etc. In earlier times, many used to give the kaineettam of a rupee and a quarter, with the quarter being an indicator of growth in abundance and prosperity.

Pathamudayam
Pathamudayam is celebrated on the 10th day of Medam Month in Malayalam Era and 10th day after Vishu. According to the tradition, ‘Pathamudayam’ is the day when the sun is most powerful and astrological science support the believe. To symbolise the ten sunrises from Vishu, traditional oil lamps with 10 wicks are lit in every house.

Velayum Kummaattiyum
A number of festivals are associated with Vishu - this includes vishuvela, vishukummaatti, etc. In some of the rural regions of Kerala, the elders of the various castes and clans of that region (""kaaranavar"") come together during the night of Vishu and engage in ""koorayidal"" - a ritual indicating the starting of a period of auspiciousness. This may extend for many weeks, till the culmination of the vela/ kummaatti. During this time, the members of these castes and clans engage in acts of nobility. Even those who consume non-vegetarian items and alcoholic drinks move themselves away from these. Acts of violence are forbidden in the 'desam' (region) during this time.

Related holidays
The date of Vishu coincides with that of festivals in other parts of India. Vaisakhi, celebrated by Hindus and Sikhs in north and central India, marks the solar new year, as does the Tamil New Year day called Puthandu. Likewise, Bihu is celebrated in Assam. The new year day is on or next to 14 April every year, and is also the new year for many Buddhist communities in parts of southeast Asia such as Myanmar and Cambodia, likely an influence of their shared culture in the 1st millennium CE.
Bishu, a Nepali festival, is celebrated on Baisakh 1 of Nepal 🇳🇵 calendar in Farwest Province of Nepal. It is the most important festival in that region.
However, this is not the universal new year for all Hindus. For some, such as those in and near Gujarat, the new year festivities coincide with the five day Diwali festival. For many others, the new year falls on Ugadi and Gudi Padwa, which falls a few weeks earlier.

About Dakkebali
Dakkebali are the result of everyone present praying with intense Bhakthi (devotion), making intricate gifts to the Lord, dancing to music, deepas (light), drawing Mandalas, flowers, fruits, and pingara, and praying together̤
The Vaidya family of the Udupi District is mostly in charge of producing Dakke Bali. The dakke instrument is played by Vaidyaas as an inherited skill. They live in Nalkoor, a neighbourhood in the Udupi region. Men dress in a way that represents Naaga Kannike. Naaga kannike is typically played by senior vaidyas. The Vaidyaas play dakke in their palms to call upon the spirits. They initially set up the dakke at the sacred location, pray, and play music over it until the local pathirs become possessed. During worship, they move sporadically due to this possession. It is referred to as Dakke Bali.
This motion represents the meeting of a male and female snake, and the number of spiral rounds has a count made up of twists known as mudi, or knots. As originally intended, they invoke the pathris, who are thought to be the male snakes that follow the nagakannike, by singing songs and portraying them in nartana manner. Up till they merge, it is mudi clockwise. Then the anticlockwise mudi represents the separation.

Mandala
The intricate Mandala, which is a serpent-shaped design drawn in natural hues, is a key component of the decorating. Yellow (turmeric), crimson (turmeric with white lime), white (white mud), green (leaf powder), and black(roasted paddy husk) are the natural colours utilised.
This mandala depicts the divine union of male and female snakes and is drawn by the Panara community in the shape of a rectangle. Dakke Bali, along with Bhuta Kola is one of the ritual dance forms practiced in Tulunadu. Together with Yakshagana, this region boasts a variety of folk dance forms.

The elephants form the core of the Mysore Dasara procession on the Vijayadashami day. The lead elephant carries the Golden Howdah (Chinnada Ambari) with the Goddess Chamundeshwari in it. The Golden Howdah weighs 750 kilograms and is made of gold.

Arrival
The Elephants start arriving to Mysore city in groups. They arrive to Mysore a month or so before the start of the actual festivities and they undergo practice for their march on the final day. The elephants are accompanied by their respective keepers or Mahouts. The elephants are usually brought in trucks and are occasionally walked the 70-km distance from their home base in the Nagarahole National Park to Mysore. Villagers greet the sacred animals all along their designated trekking route. As each party of pachyderms arrives at the Veerana Hosahalli forest checkpost in Hunsur taluk, from the forest, they are received by the District  Minister, a host of officials and prominent persons from Mysore and people from nearby villages. The villagers perform folk dances, and beat drums and sing songs to welcome the elephants. This in keeping with the royal tradition of the Mysore Maharajas.

Royal feast
While in their respective camps the elephants are served ""Ragi mudde"", a mixture of ragi and horse gram and fodder branches. But when they are royal guests in the royal city of Mysore preparing for Dasara, they are served with ‘royal’ food till the grand Dasara finale - Jamboo Savari. The elephants get to eat uddina bele (black gram), green gram, wheat, boiled rice, onion and vegetables in the mornings and evenings. They get rice, groundnut, coconut, jaggery and sugarcane with some salt to add taste to the diet after they return from their regular rehearsals. This food is served twice a day. They also get branch fodder like banyan leaves. Extra care is taken while serving food to the jumbos. High-calorie and protein-rich food is served to the elephants to improve their physical fitness.

Choosing the elephants
The Dasara Elephants are usually caught by the elephant trainers via the Khedda operation. During the Wodeyar rule, the elephants thus caught were inspected in an open field  for strength, personality, and character. The walking styles, weaknesses to seduction, the facial charisma were some of the factors considered for selection. Then the chosen elephants were trained for the festival. It is said that the king himself would oversee the training. Sometimes abandoned young elephants are also trained for dasara. The abode of the elephants during the rest of the year is usually their training camps and the surrounding National Parks. There are around 70 elephants in camps at Dubare and elsewhere. About 240 mahouts and kavadis care for the elephants.

The elephants are named in Kannada and usually have the names of Hindu gods and historical figures. Elephants Drona and Balarama carried the idol of deity Chamundeshwari housed in the Golden Howdah for a combined total of 30 years. Balarama took up the responsibility after Drona was electrocuted in 1998 at Nagarahole National Park. Balarama has been granted retirement after 13 years. The 52-year-old Arjuna replaced Balarama and carried the Golden Howdah during the Dasara 2012 Jamboo Sawari procession at Mysore on 24 October 2012. later Abhimanyu replaced Arjuna. Arjuna died on 4 December 2023 during a fight with wild tusker. The other elephants participating in the event are Bharatha, Kanthi, Gayathri, Kokila, Sri Rama, Gajendra, Biligiriranga, Vikram, Varalakshmi, and Sarojini.

Controversy
The Dasara procession has faced increasing pressure from activists and campaigners to end its controversial use of elephants.
But the elephants are provided with good care during this period with highly nutritious food & open environments to make sure there is no home sickness for any of them.

The event was also covered in the documentary film Global Metal by Sam Dunn and Scott McFadyen, which also features live recordings of the concert. Apart from fans from all over India, people traveled for this event from neighboring countries like Sri Lanka, Nepal, Pakistan, Thailand and China.

Setlist
Venue
The venue for the historic concert was the Bangalore Palace Grounds located in north Bangalore. The entire venue was enclosed within the grounds and was initially only meant for accommodating 25,000 people. But the enormous demand for tickets lead to the venue being over crowded with 35,000 people inside and around 4,000 people outside who could not enter as tickets were all sold out.
The front crowd barrier just in front of the stage had to be refortified by dozens of security staff members standing their ground supporting the barrier and placing bamboo and wooden sticks to hold the barrier due to overcrowding.

Significance
Apart from being the largest music concert to be held in India, the event was also responsible for opening the gates for other international hard rock and heavy metal bands to tour in India. Iron Maiden themselves were overwhelmed by the crowd response and have since played 2 more times in the country. It was also the first concert in India to have official merchandise stores at the venue. 
The festival is also seen as a precursor and the basis on which the now yearly Rock In India festival is based on, as Eddfest was the first of its kind rock festival in the country. The Rock In India festival takes place at the same venue as Eddfest. 
The event grossed over Rs 45,000,000 in ticket sales and another Rs 900,000 in merchandise revenue making it the most profitable concert in India with regards to total gate revenue. 
Ticketpro international reported that the remarkable success of the event was highlighted by the fact that almost 80 percent of the tickets were sold well before the concert, which is very unusual for India.
Live audio updates on the radio were constantly broadcast from the venue on Radio Indigo throughout the day.

Sponsors
The Eddfest event was produced by DNA Networks India in conjunction with NOUS Productions, and sponsored by Vh1, Nokia India, Reliance Mobile, Pepsi, NDTV 24x7, Radio Indigo, Royal Challenge and Sanyo. Travel sponsors were Lufthansa Airlines.
On-line ticketing was handled by ticketpro India and on-line marketing was done by indiatimes.com. Levi's was the merchandising partner of the event.

(India's Independence Day).","Freedom Jam is an event that is held in Bangalore City, Karnataka, India every year on 15 August
(India's Independence Day).

Overview
The Freedom Jam is a musical gathering. It is the continuation of an old musical tradition in Bangalore, where for a few years in the early eighties at Cubbon Park but is held now at Palace Grounds, musicians used to get together and perform free on Sunday evenings and still continue to do so.
The concert was revived during the Golden Jubilee celebrations of Indian Independence in 1997 featuring Ravindra Kalakshetra.
It was continued in the form of monthly jams regularly held on the first Sunday of every month (called the Sunday Jam) and a night-long free music festival - The Freedom Jam Festival - on the eve of Independence Day.
Performances have included Bangalore artists Human Bondage, Konarak Reddy, K.C.P., along with Indian artists Lucky Ali, David Rothenberg (New York), Sarjapur Blues Band, Baja, Steve Tallis (Australia), Vasundhara Das, Esperanto, Threnody, Kryptos, Bhoomi, Thermal and a Quarter. The concert has attracted audiences of over 10,000.
In 2005, the organisers of the Freedom Jam had planned for a night-long event on 15 August but had to abandon it due to terrorist activities which took place in a nearby city resulting in Bangalore being put on high alert. The Freedom Jam of 2006 was postponed to November.
The two events have served as a launchpad for many amateur artistes (particularly rock and metal bands) as well as a sort of comeback stage for established singers from Bangalore.
Freedom Jam has been started recently in neighbouring Metropolitan city of Chennai also. This year it happens in buck's theatre YMCA nandanam on 19 August. Similar to the Freedom Jam in Bangalore, this is also a free entry event.

Pondy Freedom Jam
The Freedom Jam—Pondy Music Festival has been held in Puducherry, on the Bay of Bengal coast 150 kilometres (93 mi) south of Chennai, for the last six years supported by the Dept. of Tourism. It is now held on the Republic Day weekend in January, the 'tourist season' when the weather is pleasant at several different venues showcasing music simultaneously on the beachfront. In 2010 artistes like Ministry of Blues, Matt Littlewood Group, BAJA, Inside Out, Alan Rego and many more bands including a host of ethnic performers performed over two evenings and a 'morning raga' recital at sunrise.
The concert has also been held in Chennai, once at Bucks open-air theatre, YMCA and last year at Spaces, Elliots Beach & Musee Musicale.

The next day, typically on Ganesh Chaturthi, Ganesha, her son, comes as if to take her back to her abode of Kailasha.
The Svarna Gauri Vrata (Svarṇagaurīvrata) is performed on the occasion to appease the goddess.

Svarna Gauri Vrata rituals
On this day, Women after bathing, wear new or smart clothes and dress up the girls of the family. Then they do the 'sthapana' of either jalagauri or arishinadagauri (a symbolic idol of Gauri made of turmeric). Painted and decorated clay idols of Gauri can be bought at the local market. The goddess' idol is mounted in a plate, with a cereal (rice or wheat) in it. As this puja or ritual is to be performed with 'shuchi' (cleanliness) and 'shraddhe' (dedication), the women go to temples or to another person's house, where it is performed according to set procedures or they can perform the ritual in their own homes.
A mantapa, generally decorated with banana stem and mango leaves, is built around the idol. The Gauri is decorated with garlands, decorations made of cotton, and women have a 'gauridara' (sacred thread with sixteen knots) tied to their right wrists, as blessings of the goddess and as part of the vrata. Each of the sixteen knots is worshipped with mantras during the performance of the religious practice.
An offering of baagina occurs during the festival. At least five baaginas are prepared as part of the vrata. Each baagina usually contains a packet of arshina (turmeric), kumkum, black bangles, black beads (used in the mangalsutra), a comb, a small mirror, baLe bicchoLe, coconut, blouse piece, dhaanya  (cereal), rice, toor dal, green dal, wheat or rava and jaggery cut in a cube form.
The baagina is offered in a traditional mora (winnow painted with turmeric). One such baagina is offered to Gauri and set aside. The remaining Gauri baaginas are given to the married women.

Gauri habbada mangaladravya
Another speciality of this festival is that the married woman's parents and brothers (tavaru maneyavaru) send all items required for worship (mangaladravya) to the married daughters of their family. Some send money as a substitute for mangaladravya. This good practice remains unchanged and keeps people closer. Newly-married women give sixteen pairs (jothe) baagina to married women (Sumangalis) and obtain their blessings. One baagina is kept for the Goddess Gauri (Gauramma). The main food items in this festival's feast are the delectable ""beLe hoLige"" / ""Kaayee-hoLige"", ""Huggi"" / ""Chitranna"" and ""Bajji"" .

Customs
Newlywed couples are invited to the house of their in-laws and served with festive food. In the olden days, newly-wed couples had to wait till Gauri Habba to consummate their marriage. The logic behind this practice is that if a child is conceived during Gauri Habba, which falls during the winter, the child would be born nine months later, during the summer, when it would be less prone to infections. This practice has been in place for years but has declined in recent times due to modernisation and wide contraceptive options.

Karaga festivities of Karnataka
The Karaga pot
The karaga itself is a mud pot, on which stands a tall floral pyramid that is balanced on the carrier's head. The contents of the pot have remained a secret down the centuries. The carrier's arrival is heralded by hundreds of bare-chested, dhoti-clad, turbaned Veerakumaras bearing unsheathed swords. Tradition has it that this frenzied procession of Veerakumaras accompanying the karaga carrier can execute him should he stumble and let the karaga fall. This festival that takes place in the central part of the city is called as Bengaluru Karaga.

The Karaga Carrier
The Karaga carrier is taken from his home by the members of the Dharmaraya Temple.   The carrier is practically in a trance even as he dances along with the Veerakumaras. The Veerakumaras hit the swords on their bare chests, saying ""dik-di dik-di"".

Significance of the festival
The rituals have their origin in the Mahabharata, particularly in the vastrakshepa (stripping) of Draupadi, the exile of the Pandavas and the death of Draupadi's sons at the hands of Ashwathama. After all these trials and tribulations, she emerged as a symbol of strong and ideal  womanhood

This festival is recognised as one of the largest field hockey tournaments in the world and has been referred to the Guinness Book of Records. However it has already found a mention in the Limca Book of Records, which is an Indian variant of the Guinness Book.

Origin
The Kodava hockey festival was started in the year 1997 and was the brainchild of 69-year-old Pandanda Kuttappa and Pandanda Kashi Ponnappa. Pandanda Kuttappa was a first division hockey referee and an ex-employee of State Bank of India. He conceived the idea of creating a platform in which the different Kodava families can get together. Realising the passion of hockey in Kodagu, he decided that a hockey festival would be a good event to bring Kodavas together. He also chose the hockey festival because he was disturbed about the growth of junior hockey players from Kodagu. The finances required for the inaugural tournament were provided by Pandanda Kuttappa and by his brother Pandanda Kashi Ponnappa. Pandanda Kashi Ponnappa was a renowned hockey player represented Mysuru University at a very young age and well known teacher. The response was very good and this tournament held at Karada and called as Pandanda Cup attracted around 60 families. Some rules were framed which included that all the team members must belong to the same family (surname) and participate in a full hockey attire. Even women could be a part of the team and it was left to the woman to decide whether she wants to represent the father's family or that of the husband's.

Growth
After the inaugural tournament, an academy called as The Kodava Hockey Academy was started to oversee and have the final say in all matters related to the future tournaments. Each subsequent tournament would be organised annually by a different Kodava family and the name of the family was given as the name of the tournament. The organising family was mainly responsible for arranging the finances and infrastructure needed for the festival. The cost was recovered from the sponsors and raffle tickets. Kodava families which participated in the tournament also shared a part of the cost depending on their capacity and will. The response to the tournament grew year by year and reached a maximum in the year 2003 in which 280 teams participated for the Kaliyanda Cup at Napoklu. The maximum women participation was in the year 2000 when 30 women took part in the Cheppudira Cup held at Ponnampet. The opening and closing ceremonies are held with pomp and splendour and various dances and martial arts of Kodavas are demonstrated. The tournament is inaugurated by a guest by doing a pass-back of the hockey ball using a silver hockey stick. Stalls setup around the venue do brisk business because of the large crowds that come to view the matches.
The 14th edition of the Kodava hockey tournament is being held by the Maneyapanda family in Ponnampet from 18 April to 9 May. The tournament was inaugurated by the Union Minister for Sports and Youth affairs Dr M S Gill. Dr. Gill said here on Sunday that the Government of India would do its bit to raise the sagging fortunes of Indian hockey.
Calling Maneyapanda Kodava Hockey Festival as a ""special national occasion"", Mr. Gill said he had spoken to president of the International Hockey Federation Leandro Negre that India and other hockey-playing nations in Asia should have a fair share in all matters relating to international hockey, such as management and umpiring. At the same time, he said, India needed experts in all aspects of the game.
An exhibition match was played between All Star Indian XI and Coorg XI in which the latter won 3–2. All Star Indian XI was led by Dhanraj Pillay and Coorg XI was led by C.S. Poonacha.
The 15th edition of the tournament was held at Ponnampet and was hosted by Machamada Family. A total of 228 teams participated in this edition with Palanganda family emerging as winners once again.
The 16th edition of the tournament was held at Ammathi (South Kodagu) and is hosted by Iychettira family.

Over 2 lakh people came to watch the matches and experience the festival atmosphere at the Iychettira Hockey Cup and Palanganda family was the winners again.
The 17th  edition of the tournament  was held at Balugodu  near Virajpet hosted by Madanda family. An exhibition match was played between Punjab XI and Coorg XI ended in a 1–1 draw later.

History
Folklore has it that the people of Madikeri suffered from a disease many years ago. The King of Madikeri then decided to start Mariamma festival. Then on, the Mariamma festival is said to have been celebrated. The festival starts the day after Mahalaya Amavasya. Hence Dasara starts off with four Karagas.
It is the second-most famous Dasara Festival in India after Mysore Dasara.

Karaga in Madikeri Dasara
There are 4 Mariamma Temples in the town: Dandina Mariamma, Kanchi Kamakshamma, Kundurumotte Sri Chowti Mariamma and Kote Mariamma. Each of these Mariamma Temples has Karaga, which starts on the first day of Navaratri. These four Karagas represent the ""Shakthi Devathas"" of the town. All the Temples will be decorated by Lights and the whole Madikeri looks more beautiful on these 10 days. Karaga means carrying of vessel on the shaved head which is filled with rice, 9 types of grains (navadhanya) holi water and the vessel is decorated attractively. These karagas will be roaming in and around the city of Madikeri for 5 days of DASARA and these karagas will be devoted by the households of madikeri.

On the first day of Navarathri, the priests of these four Temples carry the tools required to build karaga on their head and make their way to a Place called Pampina Kere. The members of the Temple Committee also join this puja at Pampina Kere. A team of Volaga (a type of Band in Kodagu ) will also accompany these Karagas. Volaga gives the people an indication that the Karaga is coming and also it gives a rhythm for the Karaga Dance. The priest who takes up the Karaga is dressed with Yellow coloured Kacche. Also the Priest's head is shaved. He holds a Knife in one hand and a Wooden stick (called as Bettha in Kannada) on the other. These Priests start build Karaga by using Flowers like Jasmin, Kanakambara, Sevantige etc. After building the Karaga, there will be a pooja for these four Karagas. The Temple Priests take the Karaga on their head after this pooja and will go to many temples in Rathabeedi (street for chariots). At late night they will head towards their Temples. Karaga dance is very attractive to watch. The people of Madikeri offer puja for all the Karagas. Till Ayudha pooja (puja to the weapons, and household materials) these Karagas visit almost every home of Madikeri and take pujas.

Cultural programs
The city Dasara Committee organizes cultural programmes on all the 10 days. The first 7 days the programs will be there at Kaveri Kalaskhetra (Town Hall of Madikeri - where cultural programs are held). Rest three days the programs are conducted at a Stage near Raja's Seat known as Gandhi Maidan. On the day of Vijayadashami, there will an orchestra from night 9 p.m. till morning 6 a.m. The program concludes with the price distribution cermoney for the top 3 Mantapas. In recent days Madikeri dasara is gaining more attraction compared to Mysore dasara, as Mysore dasara is held at day light but Madikeri dasara begins at Midnight of Vijayadashami.
As a part of Dasara celebrations, a variety of programmes for children were held in 2012 called Makkala Dasara for the first time in the history of Madikeri Dasara.

Procession of Mantapas
The main attraction of Madikeri Dasara is the procession of Mantapas from ten temples. The procession starts in the 9th night of Vijayadashami and ends on the 10th morning of Vijayadashami. Each Mantapa is of height about 21 to 25 feet. Studio setting is also done for these Mantapas. Now-a-days the movements of idols are so attractive to watch and these idols were prepared in many places of Karnataka. All the Idols in the mantapa will have its own movements with regard to the story which is adopted for particular mantapa. There will a Band set in front of every Mantap for the youth to dance. Whole Night Lakhs of people will be away from their houses to watch this procession. Each of these Mantapa depict the mythological stories of Hindu Mythology. The Idols in the mantap are given movements to match the story. Top Three best decorated Mantapas will be given prizes from the Madikeri Dasara committee pertaining to the movements, special attractions in the mantapa and lighting effects. Hopefully, Madikeri Dasara is one of the festival organized in Indian subcontinent which is graced and unified by other states of India like Tamil Nadu, Kerala with Karnataka. From Tamil Nadu lighting boards and Band Sets, from Kerala Band sets will be considered for Madikeri Dasara.

The man behind Madikeri Dasara
The origin and development of Madikeri Dasara celebration is closely linked with Bheem Singh, a Rajasthani, who came to Madikeri and settled down there.
Bheem Singh was the prime mover of the first Dasara mantapa procession. He made the first mantapa on tractor by making wooden pallets as mantapa.
Bheem Singh’s forefathers had migrated from Rajasthan and settled in Mysore. Later they shifted to Madikeri. Bheem Singh’s father Arjun Singh settled down in Madikeri to earn a livelihood. Bheem Singh, inspired by his father, a god fearing person, learnt the art carving kalol of deities.
Bheem Singh’s daughter Sharadha Bhai says, ""My father used to spend from his pocket and take the idols on his head and go from the house to another.""
Sharadha Bhai also recalls that in 1958 and after there were only four mantapas. Bheem Singh’s mantapa was second after the mantapa of Sri Rama Mandira. The other two were those of Decor Rama Mandira and Balaka Rama Mandira. She also recalls that the sanctity attached to Dasara celebration is in fact even today.
Bheem Singh’s grandson Ravi Kumar Singh, a PWD contractor said, ""Compared to those days, today’s Dasara can be termed a hi-tech Dasara when one looks at the way it has grown over the years."" He also recalled that when the site for his house was identified it was told that it was having a temple like structure. Hence he thought of building a temple there called Raghu Rama Mandira.
Ravi Kumar recalled the efforts of Bheem Singh in bringing toy makers from Mysore and the use of tractor to carry the idols. The first such idol was that of Sri Chamundeshwari and it was carried on a tractor in 1958. This was appreciated by the deputy commissioner of Coorg, I. C. Subbaiah awarded him in appreciation. The saga of Madikeri Dasara will not be complete without remembering Bheem Singh's Contributions.

Anointment of the Gommateshwara Bahubali image
Bahubali, the son of Rishabhanatha, the first of the twenty-four Jain Tirthankaras, is worshipped for living with exceptional qualities that he displayed during all stages of his life from conception, birth, renunciation, enlightenment and salvation. This 58.8 feet tall statue is the most magnificent among all Jain works of art. It was built in circa 983. The Bahubali statue is described as one of the mightiest achievements of ancient Karnataka in the realm of sculptural art. The statue stands upright in the posture of meditation known as kayotsarga, reaching a height of nearly 57 feet atop the Vindhyagiri - accessible through a flight of 700 steps.

Procedure
Purified water and sandalwood paste is poured over the statue from a scaffolding. This event continues for weeks. As the Mahamastakabhisheka begins, consecrated water is sprinkled onto the participants by devotees carrying 1,008 specially prepared vessels (kalashas). The statue is then bathed and anointed with libations such as milk, sugarcane juice, and saffron paste, and sprinkled with powders of sandalwood, turmeric, and vermilion. Offerings are made of petals, gold and silver coins, and precious stones. Most recently, the ceremony's finale has included an enormous shower of flowers from a waiting helicopter.

Other Mahamastakabhishekas
Apart from the anointment of the Gommateshwara statue at Shravana Belgola, anointment of the Jaina images take place at Jain temples throughout India. Anointment of the other Gommateshwara statues in Karnataka are also honoured with a Mahamastakabhisheka festival every 12 years.

The Dasara festival in Mysuru completed 409th anniversary in the year 2019, while evidence suggests the festivities were observed in Karnataka state by the Vijayanagara Empire kings in the 15th century.

History
The Dasara festivities were held in the Vijayanagar kings as early as the 14th-15th Century. The exact origin of the festival and how long back it dates is unknown. The festival played a historical role in the 14th-century Vijayanagara Empire, where it was called Mahanavami and the festivities are shown in the relief artwork of the outer wall of the Hazara Rama temple of Hampi. 
The Italian traveller Niccolò de' Conti described the festival's intensity and importance as a grandeur religious and martial event with royal support. The event revered Durga as the warrior goddess (some texts refer to her as Chamundeshwari). The celebrations hosted athletic competitions, singing and dancing, fireworks, a pageantry military parade and charitable giving to the public.
After the fall of the Vijayanagar to Deccan Sultanates, these Hindu celebrations came to an end under Muslim rulers. The Wodeyars of Mysore formed a kingdom in Southern parts of the Vijayanagara Empire and continued the Mahanavami (Dasara) festival celebration, a tradition started initially by Raja Wodeyar I (1578-1617 CE) in mid September 1610 at Srirangapatna.

Festivities
The festivities included a special durbar (royal assembly). It was during the reign of Krishnaraja Wodeyar III in the year 1805, when the king started the tradition of having a special durbar in the Mysore Palace during Dasara; which was attended by members of the royal family, special invitees, officials and the masses. After the death of Srikanta Wadiyar in December 2013, Dasara celebration in 2014 was celebrated by placing the ""Pattada Katti"" (royal sword) on the golden throne. But since his accession to the throne in 2015, Maharaja Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar have been holding the Dasara celebration and durbar. The ninth day of Dasara called as Mahanavami is also an auspicious day on which the royal sword is worshipped and is taken on a procession involving elephants, camels and horses.

Lights in Mysore Palace
The main attraction of the ten-day Mysore Dasara festival is the Mysore Palace which is lighted daily with nearly 100,000 light bulbs from 7 pm to 10 pm on all days of the festival. Various cultural and religious programs highlighting the dance, music and culture of the State of Karnataka are performed in front of the illuminated Palace.

Procession
On Vijayadashami, the traditional Dasara procession (locally known as "" jumboo Savari "") is held on the streets of Mysore city. The main attraction of this procession is the idol of the Goddess Chamundeshwari which is placed on a golden mantapa (which is around 750 kilograms of gold) on the top of a decorated elephant. This idol is worshipped by the royal couple and other invitees before it is taken around in the procession. Colourful tableaux, dance groups, music bands, decorated elephants, horses and camels form a part of the procession which starts from the Mysore Palace and culminates at a place called Bannimantap where the banni tree (Prosopis spicigera) is worshipped. According to a legend of the Mahabharata, banni tree was used by the Pandavas to hide their weapons during their one-year period of Agnatavasa (living life incognito). Before undertaking any warfare, the kings traditionally worshipped this tree to help them emerge victorious in the war. The Dasara festivities would culminate on the night of Vijayadashami with an event held in the grounds at Bannimantap called as Panjina Kavayatthu (torch-light parade).
In Mysore, India, the Vijayadashami Elephant procession during Mysore Dasara is called Jumbo Savari (from the British during their control of Mysore State). The original name to this procession is Jumbi Savari (""going to the Shami (Banni) tree""). Now Goddess Chamundeshwari is taken in procession on an Elephant. But the ""Jumbo"" name is still intact.
After the Jamboo Savari, a torchlight parade takes place in the evening at the Bannimantap Parade Grounds.

Exhibition
Another major attraction during Dasara is the Dasara exhibition which is held in the exhibition grounds opposite to the Mysore Palace. The exhibition was started by the Maharaja of Mysore Chamarajendra Wadiyar X in 1880 with the sole aim of introducing timely developments to the people of Mysore. The task of holding the exhibition is now entrusted with the Karnataka Exhibition Authority (KEA). This exhibition starts during Dasara and goes on till December. Various stalls which sell items like clothes, plastic items, kitchenware, cosmetics and eatables are set up and they attract a significant number of people. A play area containing attractions like a Ferris wheel is also present to provide entertainment to the people. Various Governmental agencies setup stalls to signify the achievements and projects that they have undertaken.

Other programmes
On all the 10 days of Dasara, various music and dance concerts are held in auditoriums around Mysore city. Musicians and dance groups from all over India are invited to perform on this occasion. Another attraction during Dasara is the Kusti Spardhe (wrestling-bout) which attracts wrestlers from all around India. There are other events at bannimantap where various groups do bike parades etc.

Controversy
The Dasara procession has faced increasing pressure from activists and campaigners to end its controversial use of elephants. Procession elephants, as well as their handlers known as 'mahouts', have died from several shocking incidents over the years.
In 2018, leaked footage from the elephants' training ground showed an elephant swaying in distress. International press labelled the video ""heartbreaking"", and reported on how the elephants must undergo two months of ""rigorous training"" in order to perform in the procession.

Hindus regard this as the day the deity Vishnu assumed his fourth avatar in the form of a ""man-lion"", known as Narasimha, to vanquish the oppressive asura king Hiranyakashipu and protect his devotee Prahlada. The legend of Narasimha represents the victory of knowledge over ignorance and the protection offered by God to his devotees.

Legend
In Hindu mythology, Hiranyakashipu was the first incarnation of Jaya, one of the two doorkeepers of Vishnu's abode of Vaikuntha. After being cursed by the Four Kumaras, along with his brother, Vijaya, he chose to be born as an enemy of Vishnu thrice, rather than as a devotee of the deity seven times. After the death of his brother, Hiranyaksha, at the hands of Varaha, the third avatara of Vishnu, Hiranyakashipu swore revenge. The king performed a severe penance to propitiate the creator deity, Brahma, until the latter appeared to grant him a boon. The asura desired the inability to be slain neither inside his house nor outside, by day nor night, by any weapon, neither on the ground nor in the sky, by neither men nor beasts, deva nor asura, nor any being created by Brahma. He also asked for rulership of all living beings and the three worlds. His wish granted, Hiranyakashipu overran the three worlds with his invincibility and his forces, seizing the throne of Indra in Svarga, and subjugating all beings, except the Trimurti, under his rule.
Hiranyakashipu's son, Prahlada, grew devoted to Vishnu, due to spending his childhood at Narada's ashrama. Angered that his son prayed to his sworn enemy, Hiranyakashipu attempted to indoctrinate him under various teachers, including Shukra, but to no avail. The king determined that such a son must die. He employed poison, snakes, elephants, fire, and warriors to slay Prahlada, but the boy was saved by praying to Vishnu on each attempt. When the royal priests attempted to indoctrinate the prince once more, he converted the other pupils to Vaishnavism. The priests created a trishula (trident) to murder the boy, but it slew them instead, after which Prahlada restored them to life. Shambarasura and Vayu were tasked with killing him, but failed. Finally, the asura had his son tied to nooses of snakes, and hurled into the ocean, with mountains launched to crush him. Prahlada remained unscathed. Frustrated, Hiranyakashipu demanded to know where Vishnu resided, and Prahlada responded that he was omnipresent. He asked his son if Vishnu lived in a pillar of his chamber, and the latter affirmed in response. Furious, the king smashed the pillar with his mace, whence Narasimha, part-man, part-lion, appeared before him. The avatara dragged Hiranyakashipu to the doorway of the palace, and ripped him apart with his claws, his form placed upon his lap, during twilight. Thus, circumventing the boon granted to the asura king, Narasimha was able to rescue his devotee, and restore order to the universe.

History
Narasimha Jayanti is referenced in the Padma Purana and Skanda Purana as Narasimha Chaturdashi. The worship of Narasimha has been present in South India for millennia, with the Pallava dynasty popularising the sect and its practices. Inscriptions have also been found referring to the occasion dating back to the Vijayanagara Empire.

Religious practices and traditions
Narasimha Jayanti is primarily observed by Vaishnavas, the adherents of Vishnu, in the South Indian states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and northern Tamil Nadu, where the veneration of Narasimha is popular. Narasimha and Lakshmi Narasimha temples throughout the aforementioned regions hold special pujas in honour of the deity during various time periods of the occasion. In the household, the shodashopachara puja is performed in the morning, and the panchopachara puja is performed in the evening, both by men.
Members of the Sri Vaishnava tradition traditionally observe fasting until the evening, and consume food after prayer. A beverage called panakam is prepared from jaggery and water, and is distributed to the Brahmins during the festivities. 
In Karnataka, community feasts are organised by certain temples to celebrate the occasion.

Bhagavata Mela
Every year on Narasimha Jayanti, a traditional folk dance known as the bhagavata mela is publicly performed in Melattur, a village in Tamil Nadu. The term ""bhagavata"" refers to the Bhagavata Purana, a prominent Hindu text in the Vaishnava tradition, while ""mela"" refers to traditional dancers or singers. Thus, this folk dance enacts stories from the Bhagavata Purana using specific dance techniques and karnatāka musical style. One particular performance that is ""noteworthy for its dramatic impact and ritual significance"" is the story of Prahlada and Narasimha.

Troupes
Typically, young males form troupes of five to ten members or more. Three to five males are painted and costumed to look like tigers, and accompanied by a band called thaase in Tulu with two or three drummers. This troupe is accompanied by the manager of the group. During Navratri, these troupes roam the streets, with accompanying drum beats of their bands. They stop at homes and businesses or on the roadsides to perform for about ten minutes after which they collect money from the people who have observed their performance.
The troupes perform until the last day of Navratri, and almost all of them form part of the Sharada processions organized by temples such as Mangaladevi, Gokarnanatheshwara and Venkatramana temple. After the procession is over, performances are stopped and the paint is removed.

Costumes
While Pili means ""tiger"" in Tulu, dancers also painted themselves with leopard or cheetah motifs. The costumes vary depending on the place. Costumes in Mangalore differ from those in Udupi district. Each person wears just a knicker/shorts, which usually has a tiger-skin motif. The rest of his bare body and face is painted with designs that denote tigers, cheetahs, and leopards. A headgear or mask made of fake fur and sometimes a tail is worn to complete the ensemble.
The paint causes a burning sensation on the skin. But this is endured as part of the celebrations and also to earn extra money in the holiday season. Originally performers did this as a part of a religious vow. The paint was kept on the body for a couple of days and repainted or retouched as needed.

Skills
Skill levels vary from person to person. The basic requirement is to know the tiger dance steps and to have enough stamina. Typical skills are Fire breathing, Hand walking, Handstands, gymnastic moves, picking money from mouth by bending backwards and lifting akkimudi (rice tied in straw, weighing 42 kg!) in their teeth and throwing it backwards etc.

Popular culture
The 2014 Kannada movie Ulidavaru Kandanthe featured a tiger dance where one of the character (actor Achyuth Kumar) belonged to the Pilivesha troupe. A song titled ""Pilivesha Beats"" was dedicated to tiger dance.
The 2021 movie Garuda Gamana Vrishabha Vahana also had a brief history and featured Pili Vesha where the character of Shiva (actor Raj B. Shetty) performed the tiger dance, with the song ""Sojugada sooju mallige"".

Significance
The Summer Storm Festival promises to be in the same vein of the Deccan Rock Festival in that both festivals promote hard rock and metal acts and does not bow to commercial or corporate pressures to have pop or radio friendly musicians performing. It is widely regarded as the biggest metal festival in the country, with thousands of metal fans from across India and abroad coming down to witness the event in the city of Bangalore every summer after the failure of the Rock 'n India festival leaning towards the more radio friendly pop genre from 2010 onwards.

Etymology
The name Yugadi or Ugadi is derived from the Sanskrit words yuga (age) and ādi (beginning): ""the beginning of a new age"". Yugadi or Ugadi falls on ""Chaitra Shudhdha Paadyami"" or the first day of the bright half of the Indian month of Chaitra. This generally falls in late March or early April of the Gregorian calendar.
The Telugu people use the term Ugadi (ఉగాది) and the Kannadigas use the term Yugadi (ಯುಗಾದಿ) for this festival.

Practices
The Kannada and Telugu communities in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu celebrate the festival with great fanfare; gatherings of the extended family and a sumptuous feast are 'de rigueur'. The day begins early with ritual showers, rubbing the body with perfumed oil, followed by prayers.

Preparations for the festival begin a week ahead. Houses are given a thorough clean. People buy new clothes, including dhoti, and buy new items for the festival, decorate the entrance of their houses with fresh mango leaves. Mango leaves and coconuts are considered auspicious in the Hindu tradition, and they are used on Ugadi. People also clean the front of their house with water and cow dung paste, then draw colorful floral designs. People offer prayers in temples. The celebration of Ugadi is marked by religious zeal and social merriment. According to Vasudha Narayanan, a professor of Religion at the University of Florida:

The pacchadi festive dish symbolically reminds the people that the following year – as all of life – will consist of not just sweet experiences, but a combination of sweet, sour, salty, and bitter episodes. Just as the different substances are bound together, one is reminded that no event or episode is wholly good or bad. Even in the midst of bitter experiences, there are sweet moments. One is also reminded that the experience of taste is transitory and ephemeral; so too, is life, and one has to learn to put pain and pleasure in proper temporal perspective.

Special dishes are prepared for the occasion. In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, foods such as pulihora, bobbatlu (Bhakshalu/ polelu/ oligale), New Year Burelu and Pachadi, and preparations made with raw mango go well with the occasion. Of these, pachadi (or Ugadi pacchadi) is the most notable, and consists of a chutney-like dish which combines ingredients to give all six flavours of food : sweet, sour, salty, spicy, bitter and astringent. This festive Hindu food is made from tamarind paste (sour), neem flowers (bitter), brown sugar or sweet jaggery (sweet), table salt (salt), green chilli (spicy) and raw mango (astringent). It is a symbolic reminder of complex phases of life one should reasonably expect in the new year.
In Karnataka, foods such as Holige or Obattu, and mango pickles are made. In addition, a speciality of yugadi in Karnataka is to create ""bEvu-bella"" a mixture of neem and jaggery, to signify both the sweet and the bitter or the sihi-kahi(ಸಿಹಿ-ಕಹಿ). This symbolizes life's own experiences with a little bit of bitterness and a hint of sweetness.

Related festivals
Maharashtran Hindus refer to the festival, observed on the same day, as Gudi Padwa (Marathi: गुढी पाडवा). The Sindhis celebrate the same day as Cheti Chand, which is the beginning of their calendar year. Manipuris also celebrate their New Year as Sajibu Nongma Panba on the same day.
The Hindus of Bali in Indonesia also celebrate their new year on the same day as Nyepi. Ugadi is one of the five Hindu national public holidays in Mauritius.

It is held in the amphitheatre located in the premises of Nrityagram at Hesaragahatta, which is a small village located 35 kilometres from the city of Bangalore. There is no entry fee and the seats are available on a first-come basis. Due to this fact, the seats start filling up from the afternoon itself. The publicity for the festival is held in a unique manner by employing folk artists and other troupes who perform on the roads of Bangalore, which publicise the event and also act as a curtain-raiser for the festival. The event is organised with the help of volunteers who belong to the colleges in the city.

Current Scenario
The event was not held in the year 2005 because India was facing the after-effects of the Indian Ocean tsunami. Habba was never held again and Nrityagram blamed it on a financial crisis. Since Nrityagram has not commented on the fate of Habba, it is assumed that the festival has been scrapped for good. Meanwhile, their dance ensemble has consistently received rave reviews and now go on frequent annual performance tours to the US and other countries.

History

He  fought two battles with invaders from Nyungti (Kullu of Himachal Pradesh) to inhibit the exterminatory forces of the battles. Sacred mask dances, known as Cham dance, are carried out in the courtyard of the old chapel, below the gates of the Leh Palace. Lamas are drawn from different monasteries from across Ladakh on a rotation basis for this festival.

Celebrations
High pitched sound of gyaling with the periodic sound of the cymbals echoed off the bare rocky slopes with the rhythmic beats of the drum. Monks look attractive in multicoloured robes and various masks, representing various forms of deities including Buddha. They danced to the beats with colorful fluttering surge to ward off evil and welcome universal peace and happiness. Mask dances are an essential part of Tantric tradition of Mahayana Buddhism.
At a one-kilometre stretch  from Moti-Market to the other end of Leh Bazaar,  thousands of stalls are also famous for a two-day long festival. Thousands of people in colourful dresses converge at Leh bazaar for games like tambola, lotteries and shopping.

Schedule
Since Ladakh follows the Tibetan lunar calendar and Dosmoche festival comes on the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth day of the twelfth month of the Tibetan calendar, every year the festival falls on a different date of the Gregorian calendar.

The Sindhu Darshan Festival is held as a celebration of the River Sindhu, as the river is an important historical icon in India and has been worshiped since the times of Ancient India. The Bollywood film Dil Se was shot during the first Sindhu Darshan Festival in October 1997.

Origin of the festival
Lal Krishna Advani and Tarun Vijay, veteran journalists, re-discovered the Sindhu river flowing through Ladakh, when they visited Leh in January 1996. Vijay conceived the idea of a festival on its banks as the river is the source of identity for India as the names India, Indian, Hindu and Hindustan are derived from Indus and Sindhu. Since then, the festival has been attracting people from all walks of life, castes, religions and places, especially becoming a pilgrimage for Sindhi Hindus, who in pre-partition days, used to worship the river in their homeland of Sindh, now in Pakistan. Lal Krishna Advani, in 1996, himself a Sindhi, visited Choglamsar (8 km from Leh) and started the Sindhu Darshan Abhiyan, with handful of other Sindhis.
The first time this event was held in the form of Sindhu Darshan Festival was in October 1997.

Year 2000 Sindhu Darshan Festival
On 7 June 2000, Sindhu Darshan Festival was held with much pomp and show and was inaugurated by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, then the Prime Minister of India at Shey (15 km away from Leh).The Prime Minister laid the foundation stone of the Sindhu Cultural Center and also inaugurated the new office complex of Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council.
The Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said ""Some people queried about existence of Sindhu in India as described in our national anthem but little did they know that it flows from our soil in Ladakh."" He further added : ""Sindhu symbolised 5,000 years ethos of Indian civilization and its re-discovery will strengthen emotional integration of country."" and quoted hymn from Rig Veda: ""Sindhu it might surpasses all the streams that flow - His roar is lifted up to heaven above the earth, he puts forth endless vigour with a flash of light, even as cow with milk rush to their calves, so other rivers roar in to Sindhu. As warrior king leads other warriors, so does Sindhu lead other rivers. Rich in good steed is Sindhu, rich in gold, nobly fashioned rich in ample wealth.""
The occasion, was also marked by immersion of waters from Brahmaputra brought by Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister, Mukut Mithi. Brahmputra & Sindhu, both rivers rise from same source in Mansarovar.

Festivities
Every year, a large number of participants from different parts of the country participate in Sindhu Darshan Festival. They bring water from the river of their own state in earthenware pots and immerse these pots in the Sindhu River.
The first day of the Sindhu Darshan Festival witnesses a reception ceremony for the participants, organized on the banks of Sindhu at Shey. This reception ceremony is conducted by a joint association of committees of various religious groups ( Buddhist, Shia, Sunni, Christian, Hindu and Sikh ) namely, Ladakh Buddhist Association, Shia Majlis, Sunni Anjuman, Christian Moravian Church, Hindu Trust and Sikh Gurudwara Prabhandak Committee, to promote national integrity. As a part of the ritual, fifty senior Lamas conduct a prayer on the banks of the river. A series of cultural programs is also presented by the artists from various states of the country. A sightseeing tour is organised for the participants and the day comes to an end with a bonfire at night. After the cultural programmes and sightseeing trip, a Puja is organized on the second day of the Sindhu Darshan Festival. On the third day, the participants get ready for the departure. Leh is popular with tourists, who visit the hill town to be a part of this grand celebrations.

Postage stamp
The Postal Department of Government of India issued a postage stamp depicting Sindhu Darshan Festival on 28 July 1999. The project 'Sindhu Darshan', was started to focus attention on the heritage of the ancient Indian Civilization and Culture that 'Sindhu' symbolizes. It aims to celebrate the Sindhu as a symbol of this country's ethnic diversity and to promote communal harmony. Further, attention is sought to be focused on cultural and topographical beauty of the landscape of Ladakh. These aspects are sought to be blended in the design of the First Day Cover which also carries inscription of the hymn 'mantra', chanted by Buddhists in the area, a prayer in praise of God. The stamp depicts a landscape in the upper reaches of the Sindhu with an inset of the 'Vrishabha' (bull) seal of the Indus Valley Civilization and a line, from the 'Rig Veda', describing the Sindhu River.

Regional Variations
The festival is known as:

Bhai Dooj (Hindi: भाई दूज) in the entire Northern part of India, observed during the Diwali festival. In Awadh and Purvanchal regions of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, it is also known as Bhaiya Dooj. It is widely celebrated by Maithils in Nepal and Bihar as Bhardutiya and people from various other ethnic groups. The first day of this New Year is observed as Govardhan Pūja.
Bhai Teeka (Nepali: भाइटीका) in Nepal, where it is the most important festival after Dashain (Vijaya Dashmi / Dussehra). Observed on the fifth day of Tihar festival, it is widely celebrated by Maithils in Nepal as Bhardutiya Bhai Tika followed by the people of various other ethnic groups among Madhesis. While, the Newaris celebrate it as Kija Puja. The sisters put a vertical Tika of seven colours known as Saptarangi Tika in their brother's forehead.
Bhai Phonta (Bengali: ভাই ফোঁটা) in Bengal and it takes place every year on the second day after Kali Puja. It is mainly observed in West Bengal, Tripura, Bangladesh.
Bhai Jiuntia (Odia: ଭାଇ ଜିଉନ୍ତିଆ) only in western Odisha.
Bhau Beej, or Bhav Bij (Marathi: भाऊ बीज) or Bhai Beej amongst the Marathi, Gujarati and Konkani-speaking communities in the states of Maharashtra, Goa, Gujarat and Karnataka.
Another name for the day is Yamadwitheya or Yamadvitiya, after a legendary meeting between Yama the god of Death and his sister Yamuna (the famous river) on Dwitheya (the second day after new moon).
Other names include Bhatru Dviteeya, or Bhatri Ditya or Bhaghini Hastha Bhojanamu in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
According to Hindu religion, after slaying the evil demon Narakasura, Lord Krishna visited his sister Subhadra who gave him a warm welcome with sweets and flowers. She also affectionately applied tilaka on Krishna's forehead. Some believe this to be the origin of the festival.

The ceremony
On the day of the festival, sisters invite their brothers for a sumptuous meal often including their favourite dishes/sweets. The procedure may be different in Bihar and central India. The whole ceremony signifies the duty of a brother to protect his sister, as well as a sister's blessings for her brother.
Carrying forward the ceremony in traditional style, sisters perform arti for their brother and apply a red tika on the brother's forehead. This tika ceremony on the occasion of Bhai Bij signifies the sister's sincerest prayers for the long and happy life of her brother and treat them with gifts.  In return, elder brothers bless their sisters and may treat them also with gifts or cash.
As it is customary in Haryana and Maharashtra to celebrate the auspicious occasion of Bhau-beej, women who do not have a brother worship the Moon Chandra instead. They apply mehendi on girls as their tradition. The sister whose brother lives far away from her and can not go to her house, sends her sincerest prayers for the long and happy life of her brother through the moon god. She performs aarti for the Moon. This is the reason why children of Hindu parents affectionately call the Moon Chandamama (Chanda means moon and mama means mother's brother).

The celebration
Bhai Phonta
Bhai Phonta in West Bengal is celebrated with much splendour. The ceremony is marked with many rituals along with a grand feast arranged for the brothers. It is necessary that, both brother and sister are more than 5 years of age.

Bhai Bij
The festival of Bhai Bij is popular in Haryana, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Goa and is celebrated with great fervour and gaiety. Brothers and sisters look forward to the occasion with immense enthusiasm. To add charm to the occasion, Bhai Bij gifts are given to brothers from sisters as a token of love and appreciation.
Bhav Bij is a time for family reunions as all brothers and sisters in the family get together. Close relatives and friends are also invited to celebrate the Bhav Bij in many families. Special dishes for the festival include the Maharashtra sweet called basundi poori or kheerni poori.
On this occasion, brothers and sisters exchange gifts. And both of them pray for their long and happy life.

Bhai Tika in Nepal
Bhai Tika in Nepal is also known as Bhai Tihar meaning Tihar (festival) of brothers. On this day, sisters pray to Yamraj for a long life and prosperity for their brothers. The ritual involves sisters marking  the forehead of their brothers with a seven coloured long tika. The rest of the ritual is similar to that performed by Hindus elsewhere. A special garland of the Gomphrena globosa flower is made by the sister as an offering to their brothers.

Rabindranath Tagore and the Partition of Bengal
Rachel Fell McDermott, Professor of Asian Studies at Columbia University, describes Rabindranath Tagore's rakhi-bandhan ceremonies, inspired by the Bhai Dooj ritual, which were organized to protest the 1905 Partition of Bengal  In 1905 Rabindranath Tagore extended the symbolism of Brother's Second, a ritual of bonding between brothers and sisters that is celebrated right after the Pujas have concluded, to evoke friendship between Hindus and Muslims: members of both communities would tie red threads of brotherhood on each other's wrists. All throughout the partition period, these rakhi-bandhan ceremonies were regularly announced in the Bengali and English papers. In addition, some landlords, even the British Indian Association, saw that the boycott and emphasis upon swadeshi items were disturbing peace with rural Muslims in their areas, and withdrew their support.

The festival is marked with the installation of Ganesha's murtis (devotional representations of a deity) privately in homes and publicly on elaborate pandals (temporary stages). Observances include chanting of Vedic hymns and Hindu texts, such as prayers and vrata (fasting).

History
Ganesha
Though not alluding to the classical form of Ganapati, the earliest mention of Ganapati is found in the Rigveda. It appears twice in the Rigveda, once in shloka 2.23.1, as well as in shloka 10.112.9. Both of these shlokas imply a role of Ganapati as ""the seer among the seers, abounding beyond measure in food presiding among the elders and being the lord of an invocation"", while the shloka in mandala 10 states that without Ganapati ""nothing nearby or afar is performed without you"", according to Michael. However, it is uncertain that the Vedic term Ganapati which literally means ""guardian of the multitudes"", referred specifically to later era Ganesh, nor do the Vedic texts mention Ganesh Chaturthi. It appears in post-Vedic texts such as the Grhya Sutras and thereafter ancient Sanskrit texts such as the Vajasaneyi Samhita, the Yajnavalkya Smriti and the Mahabharata mention Ganapati as Ganesvaras and Vinayak. Ganesh appears in the medieval Puranas in the form of ""god of success, obstacle remover"". The Skanda Purana, Narada Purana and the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, in particular, profusely praise him. Beyond textual interpretations, archaeological and epigraphical evidence suggest Ganesha had become popular and was revered before the 8th century CE and numerous images of him are traceable to the 7th century or earlier.
For example, carvings at Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain temples such as at the Ellora Caves, dated between the 5th and 8th-century show Ganesha reverentially seated with Shakti, another Hindu goddess.

Festival
Although it is unknown when (or how) Ganesh Chaturthi was first observed, the festival has been publicly celebrated in Pune since the era of King Shivaji (1630–1680, founder of the Maratha Empire). The Peshwa in the 18th century were devotees of Ganesha and started as a public Ganesh festival in their capital city of Pune during the month of Bhadrapad. After the start of the British Raj, the Ganesh festival lost state patronage and became a private family celebration in Maharashtra until its revival by Indian freedom fighter and social reformer Lokmanya Tilak. Indian freedom fighter Lokmanya Tilak, championed it as a means to circumvent the colonial British government ban on Hindu gatherings through its anti-public assembly legislation in 1892. Lokmanya Tilak started the festival in Pune and Girgaon, Mumbai. 

I followed with the greatest curiosity crowds who carried in procession an infinite number of idols of the God Ganesh. Each little quarter of the town, each family with its adherents, each little street corner I may almost say, organizes a procession of its own, and the poorest may be seen carrying on a simple plank their little idol or of paper mâché... A crowd, more or less numerous, accompanies the idol, clapping hands and raises cries of joy, while a little orchestra generally precedes the idol.– Angelo de Gubernatis, Bombay Gazette (1886)

According to others such as Kaur, the festival became a public event later, in 1892 when Bhausaheb Laxman Javale (also known as Bhau Rangari), installed the first sarvajanik (public) Ganesha idol in Pune. In 1893, the Indian freedom fighter Lokmanya Tilak praised the celebration of Sarvajanik Ganesh Utsav in his newspaper, Kesari, and dedicated his efforts to launch the annual domestic festival into a large, well organised public event. Tilak recognised Ganesh's appeal as ""the god for everybody"", and according to Robert Brown, he chose Ganesha as the god that bridged ""the gap between Brahmins and non-Brahmins"", thereby building a grassroots unity across them to oppose British colonial rule.
Other scholars state that the British Empire, after 1870 out of fear of seditious assemblies, had passed a series of ordinances that banned public assembly for social and political purposes of more than 20 people in British India, but exempted religious assembly for Friday mosque prayers under pressure from the Indian Muslim community. Tilak believed that this effectively blocked the public assembly of Hindus whose religion did not mandate daily prayers or weekly gatherings, and he leveraged this religious exemption to make Ganesh Chaturthi to circumvent the British colonial law on large public assembly. He was the first to install large public images of Ganesha in pavilions in Bombay Presidency, and other celebratory events at the festival.

According to Richard Cashman, Tilak recruited and passionately committed himself to god Ganesha after the 1893 Hindu-Muslim communal violence in Bombay and the Deccan riots, when he felt that the British India government under Lord Harris had repeatedly taken sides and not treated Hindus fairly because Hindus were not well organised. In Tilak's estimate, Ganesha worship and processions were already popular in rural and urban Hindu populations, across social castes and classes in Baroda, Gwalior, Pune and most of the Maratha region in the 18th century. In 1893, Tilak helped expand Ganesh Chaturthi festival into a mass community event and a hidden means for political activism, intellectual discourse, poetry recitals, plays, concerts, and folk dances.
In Goa, Ganesh Chaturthi predates the Kadamba era. The Goa Inquisition had banned Hindu festivals, and Hindus who did not convert to Christianity were severely restricted. However, Hindu Goans continued to practice their religion despite the restrictions. Many families worship Ganesha in the form of patri (leaves used for worshiping Ganesha or other gods), a picture is drawn on paper or small silver idols. In some households Ganesha idols are hidden, a feature unique to Ganesh Chaturthi in Goa due to a ban on clay Ganesha idols and festivals by the Jesuits as part of the Inquisition.

Celebration in India
In India, Ganesh Chaturthi is primarily celebrated at home and in public by local community groups in the central and western states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Goa and the southern states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and eastern states of West Bengal and Odisha and in North eastern state of Assam. 
On the same day, Chaurchan festival is celebrated in Mithila region of Bihar which is related to Ganesha and Chandra, the Hindu moon god.
The date for the festival is usually decided by the presence of Chaturthi Thithi. The festival is held during ""Bhadrapada Madyahanaa Purvabaddha"". If the Chaturthi Thiti begins at night on the previous day and gets over by morning on next day, then the next day is observed as Vinayaka Chaturthi.
In the consecration ceremony, a priest performs a Prana Pratishtha to invite Ganesh like a guest. This is followed by the 16-step Shodashopachara ritual, (Sanskrit: Shodash, 16; Upachara, process) during which coconut, jaggery, modaks, durva grass and red hibiscus (Jaswand) flowers are offered to the idol. Depending on the region and time zone, the ceremony commences with hymns from the Rigveda, the Ganapati Atharvashirsa, the Upanishads and the Ganesh stotra (prayer) from the Narada Purana are chanted. In Maharashtra as well as Goa, aarti is performed with friends and family, typically in the morning and evening.
In preparation for the festival, artisans create clay models of Ganesha for sale. The images (Murtis) range in size from 20 mm (3⁄4 in) for homes to over 20 m (70 ft) for large community celebrations.
On the last day of the festival, the tradition of Ganesh visarjan or nimajjanam (lit. ""immersion"") takes places, when the Ganesha images are immersed in a river, sea or water body. On the last day, the devotees come out in processions carrying the idols of Ganesha, culminating in immersion. It is believed that the god who comes to the earthly realm on Ganesh Chaturthi, returns to his celestial abode after immersion. The celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi also denotes the significance of the cycle of birth, life and death. It is believed that when the idol of the Ganesha is taken out for immersion, it also takes away with it the various obstacles of the house and these obstacles are destroyed along with the immersion. Every year, people wait with great anticipation to celebrate the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi.

Domestic celebration
In Maharashtra, Ganesh Chaturthi is known as Ganeshotsav. Families install small clay Murtis for worship during the festival. At home, the festival preparation includes purchases such as puja items or accessories a few days in advance and booking the Ganesh murti as early as a month beforehand (from local artisans). The murti is brought home either a day before or on the day of the Ganesh Chaturthi itself. Families decorate a small, clean portion of the house with flowers and other colourful items before installing the idol. When the Murti is installed, it and its shrine are decorated with flowers and other materials. On the day of the festival, The ceremonial installation of the clay murti (idol) is done along with chants of holy mantras and puja including bhajans during a certain auspicious period of the day. The Murti is worshipped in the morning and evening with offerings of flowers, durva (strands of young grass), karanji and modaks (jaggery and coconut flakes wrapped in rice flour dumplings). The worship ends with the singing of an aarti in honour of Ganesh, other Gods and Saints. 
In Maharashtra the Marathi aarti ""Sukhakarta Dukhaharta"", composed by the 17th-century saint, Samarth Ramdas is sung.
Family traditions differ about when to end the celebration. Domestic celebrations end after 1+1⁄2, 3, 5, 7 or 11 days. At that time the Murti is ceremoniously brought to a body of water (such as a lake, river or the sea) for immersion. In Maharashtra, Ganeshotsav also incorporates other festivals, namely Hartalika and the Gauri festival, the former is observed with a fast by women on the day before Ganesh Chaturthi whilst the latter by the installation of Murtis of Gauris. In some communities such as the Chitpavan, and the CKP, pebbles collected from river bank are installed as representations of Gauri.
In Goa, Ganesh Chaturthi is known as Chavath in Konkani and Parab or Parva (""auspicious celebration""); it begins on the third day of the lunar month of Bhadrapada. On this day Parvati and Shiva are worshipped by women, who fast. Instruments such as ghumots, crash cymbals (ताळ(taal) in Konkani) and pakhavaj (an Indian barrel-shaped, two-headed drum)  are played during the rituals. The harvest festival, Navyachi Pancham, is celebrated the next day; freshly harvested paddy is brought home from the fields (or temples) and a puja is conducted. Communities who ordinarily eat seafood refrain from doing so during the festival.
In Karnataka the Gowri festival precedes Ganesh Chaturthi, and people across the state wish each other well. In Andhra Pradesh, Ganesh Murtis of clay (Matti Vinayakudu) and turmeric (Siddhi Vinayakudu) are usually worshipped at home with plaster of Paris Murti's.

Public celebration
Public celebrations of the festival are popular and are organized by local youth groups, neighborhood associations, or groups of tradespeople. Funds for the public festival are collected from members of the association arranging the celebration, local residents and businesses. The Ganesh idols and accompanying Musti are installed in temporary shelters, known as mandaps or pandals. Public preparations begin months in advance. The making of the Murti in Maharashtra usually begins with ""Padya pooja"" or worshipping the feet of Ganesh. The Murtis are brought to ""pandals"" on the day or a day before the festival begins. The pandals have elaborate decoration and lighting.
The festival features cultural activities such as singing, theatre and orchestral performances and community activities such as free medical checkups, blood-donation sites and donations to the poor. Ganesh Chaturthi, in addition to its religious aspects, is an important economic activity in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Nashik, Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Indore, Surat, Hyderabad, Visakhapatnam, Bangalore, Chennai and Kurnool. Many artists, industries, and businesses earn a significant amount of their living from the festival, which is a stage for budding artists. Members of other religions also participate in the celebration.
In Tamil Nadu, the festival, also known as Vinayaka Chaturthi or Pillayar Chaturthi, falls on the fourth day after the new moon in the month of Āvaṇi in the Tamil calendar. The idols are usually made of clay or papier-mâché, since Plaster of Paris idols have been banned by the state government, but violations of this rule are often reported. Idols are also made of coconuts and other organic products. They are worshipped for several days in pandals and immersed in the Bay of Bengal the following Sunday. In Kerala the festival is also known as Lamboodhara Piranalu, which falls in the month of Chingam. In Thiruvananthapuram a procession marches from the Pazhavangadi Ganapathi Temple to Shankumugham Beach, with tall Murti of Ganesha made from organic items and milk immersed in the sea.

At prominent temples
At Varasidhi Vinayaka Swamy Temple in Kanipakam, Andhra Pradesh, annual brahmotsavams will be celebrated for 21 days starting from Vinayaka Chavithi day. The processional deity of Vinayaka (Ganesh) will be taken in a procession on different vahanams on these days amidst large number of pilgrims across the country.

Celebration outside India
In Pakistan, Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations are conducted by the Shri Maharashtra Panchayat, an organisation for Maharashtrians in Karachi.
Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated in the UK by the British Hindu population living there. The Hindu Culture and Heritage Society, a Southall-based organisation, celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi for the first time in London in 2005 at the Vishwa Hindu Temple; and the idol was immersed in the River Thames at Putney Pier. Another celebration, organised by a Gujarati group, has been celebrated in Southend-on-Sea, and attracted an estimated 18,000 devotees. Annual celebrations are also held on the River Mersey in Liverpool, in the North Sea at Clacton-on-Sea, and Caldecotte Lake in Milton Keynes.
The Philadelphia Ganesh Festival is one of the most popular celebrations of Ganesh Chaturthi in North America, and it is also celebrated in Canada (particularly in the Toronto area), Detroit Metropolitan area-Wayne State university, Mauritius, Malaysia and Singapore. The Mauritius festival dates back to 1896, and the Mauritian government has made it a public holiday. In Malaysia and Singapore, the festival is more commonly known as Vinayagar Chaturthi because of the large Tamil-speaking Hindu minority.
In Ghana, ethnic African Hindus celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi.

Foods
The primary sweet dish during the festival is modak (modak in Marathi and Konkani, modakam or kudumu in Telugu, modaka or kadubu in Kannada, kozhakatta or modakkam in Malayalam and kozhukattai or modagam in Tamil). A modak is a dumpling made from rice or wheat flour, stuffed with grated coconut, jaggery, dried fruits and other condiments and steamed or fried. Another popular sweet dish is the karanji (karjikai in Kannada), similar to modak in composition and taste but in a semicircular shape. This sweet meal is called Nevri in Goa and is synonymous with Ganesh festival amongst the Goans and the Konkani diaspora.
In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana modak, laddu, vundrallu (steamed, coarsely ground rice-flour balls), panakam (a jaggery-, black pepper- and cardamom-flavoured drink), vadapappu (soaked moong lentils) and chalividi (a cooked rice flour and jaggery mixture) are offered to Ganesh. These offerings are known as naivedya, and a plate of modak traditionally holds 21 pieces of the sweet. In Goa, modak and a Goan version of idli (sanna) is popular.
Panchakajjaya is an offering made to Ganesh during this festival in parts of Karnataka. It is a mixture of desiccated coconut, roasted Bengal gram powder, sugar, ghee, and sesame. Different versions of panchakajjaya are made. Roasted Bengal gram, green gram, roasted chana dal (putani) or aval can be used.

Environmental impact
The Madras High Court ruled in 2004 that immersion of Ganesh idols is unlawful because it incorporates chemicals that pollute the sea water. In Goa the sale of plaster-of-Paris Ganesha idols has been banned by the state government and celebrants are encouraged to buy traditional, artisan-made clay idols. Recent initiatives to produce traditional clay Ganesh idols in Hyderabad have been sponsored by the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board. Environmental concern is also making people in Gujarat to opt for Ganesh idols made with a mixture of cow dung and clay. These are marketed as ""Vedic Ganesh idols"" by the organization making them.
Due to environmental concerns, a number of families now avoid bodies of water and let the clay murtis disintegrate in a barrel of water at home. After a few days, the clay is spread in the garden. In some cities a public, eco-friendly process is used for the immersion.

It is celebrated in and around Maharashtra, Goa and Daman at the start of Chaitra, the first month of the lunisolar Hindu calendar. The festival is characterised by colourful floor decorations called rangoli, a special gudi dvaja; which is a saari or dhoti or other piece of cloth garlanded with flowers, mango and neem leaves; a sugar crystal garland called gathi, topped with upturned silver or copper vessels. Celebration also includes street gathering, dancing and festive foods.

In Maharashtra, the first day of the bright phase of the moon is called gudi pāḍwā (Marathi: गुढी पाडवा), pāḍvo (Konkani: पाडवो); pāḍya (Kannada: ಪಾಡ್ಯ); pāḍyami (Telugu: పాడ్యమి). Konkani Hindus variously refer to the day as sausāra pāḍavo or sausāra pāḍyo  (सौसार पाडवो and सौसार पाडयो, respectively).Kannada Hindus in Karnataka refer to it as  Yugādi/Ugadi (ಯುಗಾದಿ),while ,Telugu Hindus celebrate the same occasion as Ugadi (ఉగాది). Sindhi people celebrate the day as Cheti Chand, it is observed as the emergence of the day of Jhulelal. Prayers are offered to Jhulelal, and the festival is celebrated by making delicacies like tahiri (sweet rice) and sai bhaji. Kashmiri Pandits celebrate this day as Navreh.Kashmiri New Year is the celebration of the first day of the Kashmiri new year by Kashmiri Hindus, with the largest Kashmiri Hindu community being the Kashmiri Pandits.

It takes place on the first day of the bright half (Shukla Paksha) on the month of Chaitra (March–April) of the Kashmiri Hindu calendar.
However, this is not the universal new year for all Hindus. For some, such as those in and near Gujarat, the new year festivities coincide with the five-day Diwali festival. For many others, the new year falls on Vaisakhi between 13 and 15 April, according to the solar cycle part of the Hindu lunisolar calendar and this is by far the most popular not only among Hindus of the Indian subcontinent but also among Buddhists and Hindus of Southeast Asia.","Gudhi Padwa is a spring festival marking the start of the lunisolar new year for Marathi and Konkani Hindus.

Konkani Hindus variously refer to the day as sausāra pāḍavo or sausāra pāḍyo  (सौसार पाडवो and सौसार पाडयो, respectively).Kannada Hindus in Karnataka refer to it as  Yugādi/Ugadi (ಯುಗಾದಿ),while ,Telugu Hindus celebrate the same occasion as Ugadi (ఉగాది). Sindhi people celebrate the day as Cheti Chand, it is observed as the emergence of the day of Jhulelal. Prayers are offered to Jhulelal, and the festival is celebrated by making delicacies like tahiri (sweet rice) and sai bhaji. Kashmiri Pandits celebrate this day as Navreh.Kashmiri New Year is the celebration of the first day of the Kashmiri new year by Kashmiri Hindus, with the largest Kashmiri Hindu community being the Kashmiri Pandits. Kashmiri Pandits dedicate Navreh festival to their Goddess Sharika, a form of Goddess Durga or Shakti, and pay homage to her during the festival. It takes place on the first day of the bright half (Shukla Paksha) on the month of Chaitra (March–April) of the Kashmiri Hindu calendar.
However, this is not the universal new year for all Hindus. For some, such as those in and near Gujarat, the new year festivities coincide with the five-day Diwali festival. For many others, the new year falls on Vaisakhi between 13 and 15 April, according to the solar cycle part of the Hindu lunisolar calendar and this is by far the most popular not only among Hindus of the Indian subcontinent but also among Buddhists and Hindus of Southeast Asia.

Etymology
Gudi means 'flag'; according to Kittel, the term is of South Indian origin. The word pāḍavā is derived from the Sanskrit word pratipad for the first day of each fortnight in a lunar month, or the first day on which the moon appears after the ""new moon"" day (amāvāsya) and the first day after the full moon. A Gudhi is also hoisted on this occasion, gives this festival its name. The term padva or padavo is also associated with Balipratipada.

Significance
Gudi Padva signifies the arrival of spring and the reaping of rabi crops. The festival is linked to the day on which the Hindu god Brahma created time and the universe. To some, it commemorates the coronation of Rama in Ayodhya after his victory over Ravana, or the start of the Shalivahan calendar after he defeated the Huns in the first century. According to Anne Feldhaus, in rural Maharashtra, the festival is linked to Shiva's dance and the coming together of the community as they carry the Gudi Kavads together to a Shiva temple.

The guḍhī
During Gudi Padwa, gudi (or gudhi) are arranged at every household. It is a bright, colorful silk scarf-like cloth tied at the top of a long bamboo. On top of it, one or more boughs of neem and mango leaves are attached with a garland of flowers. It is capped with a silver, bronze, or copper pot (handi or kalash), signifying victory or achievement.
Some temples are located on the top of hills, and groups work together to help reach the kavad to the top.

Some of the significances attributed to raising a gudi are as follows:

It symbolises the victory of King Shalivahana and was hoisted by his people when he returned to Paithan.
It symbolises Brahma's flag mentioned in the Brahma Purana, and may also represent Indra's flag.
It is believed to ward off evil, invite prosperity and good luck into the house.

Festivities
Traditionally, families prepare a special dish that mixes various flavours, particularly the bitter leaves of the neem tree and sweet jaggery (gur, gul). Additional ingredients include sour tamarind and astringent dhane seeds. This, like the pacchadi recipe used in Ugadi festival, is eaten as a reminder of life's sweet and bitter experience and a belief that the neem-based mixture has health benefits.

Other names
The festival is also known as

Cheti Chand among the Sindhi people
Navreh among the Kashmiri Pandits in Jammu and Kashmir
Pahela Baishakh among the Bengalis in West Bengal and Bangladesh
Puthandu among the Tamils in Tamil Nadu

Date variations
Makar Sankranti is set by the solar cycle and corresponds to the exact time astronomical event of the Sun entering Capricorn and is observed on a day that usually falls on 14 January of the Gregorian calendar, but on 15 January in leap years. Makar Sankranti's date and time is analogous to Sidereal time of Zodiac sign of Capricorn (when sun enters).
The year is 365.24 days long and the time difference between the two consecutive instances of Makar Sankranti is almost the same as the year. There are 365 days in a year. Thus, every four years the calendar is offset by one day which is adjusted by adding leap day (29 February). Hence, Makar Sankranti falls on 15 January every leap year. Sidereal time of sign of Capricorn also shifts by a day due to leap year. Similarly, the time of equinoxes also shifts by a day in each four year window. For example, the equinox of September does not fall on the same date each year nor does the winter solstice. Any event related to one revolution of the Earth around the Sun will have this date shift within a four year cycle. Similar changes can be seen in the exact time of solstices and equinoxes. See the table, how the time of the equinox and a solstice increases and decreases in a cycle of four years.
The time difference between two consecutive winter solstices is about 5 hours 49 minutes 59 seconds, with respect to winter solstice time, and the time difference between two consecutive Mankar Sankranti is about 6 hours and 10 minutes. Towards the end of the 21st century, there will be more occurrences of Makar Sankranti on 15 January in a four-year cycle.
And Makar Sankranti will be on 16 January for the first in the year 2102 as 2100 will not be a leap year.

Makar Sankranti and Uttar Ayana
Makar Sankranti is celebrated when the Sun's ecliptic longitude becomes 270° measured from a fixed starting point which is in opposition to Spica, i.e. this is a sidereal measure. Uttarayana begins when the Sun's ecliptic longitude becomes 270° measured from the Vernal equinox, i.e. this is a tropical measure. While both concern a measure of 270° their starting points are different. Hence, Makar Sankranti and Uttarayana occur on different days. On the Gregorian calendar, Makar Sankranti occurs on 14 or 15 January; Uttarayana starts on 21 December.
Due to the precession of the equinoxes the tropical zodiac (i.e. all the equinoxes and solstices) shifts by about 1° in 72 years. As a result, the December solstice (Uttarayana) is continuously but very slowly moving away from Makar Sankranti. Conversely, the December solstice (Uttarayana) and Makar Sankranti must have coincided at some time in the distant past. Such a coincidence last happened 1700 years back, in 291 CE.

Significance
Every year Makar Sankranti is celebrated in the month of January. This festival is dedicated to the Hindu religious sun god Surya. This significance of Surya is traceable to the Vedic texts, particularly the Gayatri Mantra, a sacred hymn of Hinduism found in its scripture named the Rigveda. Makara Sankranti is also associated with the birth and coming of the final Avatar of the Hindu God Vishnu, Kalki.
Makara Sankranti is regarded as important for spiritual practices and accordingly, people take a holy dip in rivers, especially Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri. The bathing is believed to result in merit or absolution of past sins. They also pray to the Sun and give thanks for their successes and prosperity. A shared cultural practices found amongst Hindus of various parts of India is making sticky, bound sweets particularly from sesame (til) and a sugar base such as jaggery (gud, gur, gul). This type of sweet is a symbolism for being together in peace and joyfulness, despite the uniqueness and differences between individuals. For most parts of India, this period is a part of early stages of the Rabi crop and agricultural cycle, where crops have been sown and the hard work in the fields is mostly over. The time thus signifies a period of socializing and families enjoying each other's company, taking care of the cattle, and celebrating around bonfires, in Gujarat the festival is celebrated by flying kites.
Makara Sankranti is an important pan-Indian solar festival, known by different names though observed on the same date, sometimes for multiple dates around the Makar Sankranti. It is known as Pedda Panduga'/'Makara Sankranti in Andhra Pradesh, Makara Sankranti in Karnataka, Telangana, and Maharashtra, Pongal in Tamil Nadu, Magh Bihu in Assam, Magha Mela in parts of central and north India, as Makar Sankranti in the west, Makara Sankranti or Shankaranti in Kerala, and by other names.

This is an essential reason behind wearing black, which is otherwise barred on festival days. As per another legend, Lord Surya forgave his son Shani and his son visited him on Sankranti. That is the essential reason why people distribute sweets and urge them to let go of any negative or angry feelings. Also, newly married women offer five sunghat or small clay pots with black beaded threads tied around them, to the Shakti deity. These pots are filled with newly harvested food grains and are offered with betel leaves and areca nut. Its observance takes place on a rather subdued note, unlike major festivals of the region like Ganesh Chaturthi.

Odisha
The festival is known as Makara Sankranti in Odisha where people prepare makara chaula (Odia: ମକର ଚାଉଳ): uncooked newly harvested rice, banana, coconut, jaggery, sesame, rasagola, Khai/Liaa and chhena puddings for naivedya to gods and goddesses. The withdrawing winter entails a change in food habits and intake of nourishing and rich food. Therefore, this festival holds traditional cultural significance. It is astronomically important for devotees who worship the sun god at the great Konark temple with fervour and enthusiasm as the sun starts its annual swing northwards. According to various Indian calendars, the Sun's movement changes and the days from this day onwards become lengthier and warmer and so the Sun-God is worshiped on this day as a great benefactor. Many individuals at the start of the day perform a ritual bath while fasting. Makara Mela (Fun fair) is observed at Dhabaleswar in Cuttack, Hatakeshwar at Atri in Khordha, Makara Muni temple in Balasore and near deities in each district of Odisha. In Puri special rituals are carried out at the temple of Lord Jagannath. In Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar, Kalahandi, Koraput and Sundargarh where the tribal population is greater, the festival is celebrated with great joy. They celebrate this festival with great enthusiasm, singing, dancing and generally having an enjoyable time. This Makara Sankranti celebration is next to the Odia traditional new year Maha Vishuva Sankranti which falls in mid April. Tribal groups celebrate with traditional dancing, eating their particular dishes sitting together, and by lighting bonfires.

Punjab
In Punjab, Makar Sankranti is celebrated as Maghi which is a religious and cultural festival. Bathing in a river in the early hours on Maghi is important. Hindus light lamps with sesame oil as this is supposed to give prosperity and drive away all sins. A major mela is held at Sri Muktsar Sahib on Maghi which commemorates a historical event in Sikh history.

Tamil Nadu and Puducherry
It is a four-day festival in South India:

Day 1: Bhogi Pandigai
Day 2: Thai Pongal
Day 3: Maattu Pongal
Day 4: Kaanum Pongal

Bhogi
The first day of festival is Bhogi . It is celebrated on the last day of Margazhi by discarding household items and setting them on fire, marking the end of the old and the emergence of the new. Kaappu kattu (kappu means secure) is a tradition of tying leaves of Azadirachta indica, Senna auriculata and Aerva lanata along the roofs and walls of houses and residential areas that is widely practiced in the Kongu Nadu region. This is set to eliminate evil forces. This day is also held in honor of Indra, the Hindu god of rain.

Thai Pongal

The second day of festival is Thai Pongal or simply Pongal.  It is celebrated by boiling rice with fresh milk and jaggery in new pots, which are later topped with brown sugar, cashew nuts and raisins early in the morning and allowing it to boil over the vessel. This tradition gives Pongal its name. The moment the rice boils over and bubbles out of the vessel, the tradition is to shout ""பொங்கலோ பொங்கல் (Ponggalo Ponggal)!"" and blow the sangu (a conch), a custom practised to announce it was going to be a year blessed with good tidings. Then, new boiled rice is offered to the Sun god during sunrise, as a prayer which symbolises thanks to the sun for providing prosperity. It is later served to the people in the house for the ceremony. People prepare savouries and sweets such as vadai, murukku, payasam and visit each other and exchange greetings.

Maattu Pongal

The third day of festival is Maattu Pongal. It is for offering thanks to cattle, as they help farmers in agriculture. On this day the cattle are decorated with paint, flowers and bells. They are allowed to roam free and fed sweet rice and sugar cane. Some people decorate the horns with gold or other metallic covers.

In Kerala, this is called as Sankranti or Makara Sankranti. In Malabar villages, this used to be celebrated as the victory over a demon. In Sabarimala, on this day, the Makaravilakku is lit to show the significanceofthelord- god.

Tripura
The Tripuri is the promoter of Hangrai festivals. They have first introduced this festival of immersing of ancestors' remains in the holy river. Since then it was adopted by other groups in India and popularized over the years.
Mythology inform us that when the world was just created by Lord Siva or Sibrai there was only the grassland and nothing was present. The god then created an egg to produce a human being. The egg hatched to give birth to a human being, creating a big bang. He crawled out of eggshells and looked around for anyone like him, but he found none. There was total silence, peace tranquility, and harmony on the earth. He was frightened by seeing this scenario of earth. He remained near the eggshell most of the time and went back near to the empty eggshell, went inside of half of the shell and covered it with another one, and hid there.
The almighty God was upset by this development. Years later he created another egg, and after ten months it hatched. There was a big bang when it hatched that shook the earth and gave birth to another human. He was very courageous and powerful, as soon as he came out of the human eggshell, he started shouting and announced to the whole of the world, 'I am the first to be born in this earth, I am the eldest on the earth, no one is elder to me in this earth. He named himself Subrai and declared to the whole of the earth that he is the ruler of this earth and king of this universe. Hearing the big bang Hangrai got more frightened, closed his eyes, and silently remained inside the shell. But when he heard the voice like his own, he came out of his shell and met Subrai. At this Subrai told that he is older than Hangrai, since then Subrai became the elder brother of Hangrai, and people knew them as it is.
Thousand of years later when they grew older, the time had come to leave this world. As Hangrai grew older than Subrai, one day he felt sick very seriously, Hangrai was on his death bed, Subrai was taking care of him. Then god came before them and said, 'Among both of you, Hangrai is elder than Subrai, I only know this, because I have created both of you. Hangrai will leave this earth very soon. Subrai will do all necessary rituals to cremate the body of Hangrai.' And god disappeared from there.
Then Subrai cried like a baby, touching the feet of Hangrai, saying, 'Elder brother, I have treated you like a younger brother for thousands of years, forgive me for my wrongdoing unto you.'
Hangrai said, 'I have done so!' and touched his head as gesture of forgiving and blessing unto him, and then breadth for his last.
After the death of Hangrai, his younger brother Subrai cremated his body and did all the rituals, and immerged Hangrai's remaining in the holy water of the river on the last day of Pousa month. Since then, people observed these rituals and festivals every year and continued to this day. That is why the day is named ""Hangrai"", which has later adopted by other ethnic groups of people of India.
Every year on the day of Hangrai the Tripuri people observe it in grand pomp and show. In every house of Tripuri preparation for Hangrai starts two-three days before. Houses are cleaned, washed whitewashed. All the utensils, clothes, articles are cleaned, homes are decorated. Different types of Tripura cakes, dishes, and drinks are prepared, near and dear ones, relatives are invited for a feast.

Over two million people gather at their respective sacred places for this holy bathing such as Prayagraj and Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh and Haridwar in Uttarakhand.  The day at a domestic household begins by taking ritual bath before sunrise, doing ritualistic prayers to the rising Sun. It also includes pledging for and donating Food, clothing and money to Brahmin/s called Purohita.

Many families in villages across Bangladesh observe Makar Sankranti in many ways. At midnight on January 14/15, people light fireworks to mark the beginning of the holiday. Betting games are played, but with fruits, similar to dice games. Families round up ingredients to compete with others in their village to see who can create the largest variety of pithas. Others go fishing in ponds, creeks and streams to see who can catch the largest fish. It is a fun holiday that many wait for year-long. 
The holiday is observed by a significant amount of the Bengali diaspora as well.

Nepal
Maghe Sankranti is a Nepalese festival observed on the first of Magha in the Vikram Sambat (B.S) calendar (about 14 January). Tharu people celebrate this particular day as new year. It is also regarded as the major government declared annual festival of the Magar community.
Observant Hindus take ritual baths during this festival.

Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, and among Tamil diasporas worldwide
On this day, the Tamil farmers and the Tamil People honour and perform a pooja to the Sun God Suriya Narayanan. This happens when the sun enters the zodiac sign of Capricorn (Makara). The Thai Pongal festival is celebrated in mid-January, or the Tamil month of Thai, to coincide with the rice harvest.
Pongal practices and rituals in Sri Lanka and diasporic countries aren't much differentiated from those followed in Southern India, outside notably the Jalikkattu practice, which is not existent among Sri Lankan Tamils and diasporic Tamil communities. 
In Sri Lanka, celebrations of Pongal extend generally to two days and not four, and instead of the Pongal dish, a similar food called Pukkai is offered. Its preparation happen on the first day and not on the second as in India (where Pongal start one day earlier with Boghi day). Hence here, Pongal celebration is focused on the day of Thai Pongal only.

Etymology
Panchami is the fifth day among the fifteen days of the moon's waxing and/or waning. This special day of the serpent worship always falls on the fifth day of the moon's waning in the Lunar Hindu month of Shravana July/August. Hence this is called Naga Panchami (Naga: cobra; or simply, serpent).

Legends
There are many legends in Hinduism and folklore narrated to the importance of worship of snakes. According to Hindu Puranas and the Mahabharata, Kashyapa, grandson of the universal creator Lord Brahma, married two daughters of Prajapati Daksha, Kadru and Vinata. Kadru then gave birth to the race of Naga, while Vinata gave birth to Aruna, who became the charioteer of the sun god, Surya, and also gave birth to the great eagle Garuda, who became the carrier of Vishnu. Naga Panchami is also a day when Akhara, traditional Indian wrestling gyms, hold special celebrations to honor the mystical symbolism of the snake as a symbol of virility and kundalini energy.

History
Indian scriptures such as Agni Purana, Skanda Purana, Narada Purana and the Mahabharata give details of history of snakes extolling worship of snakes.
In the Mahabharata epic, Janamejaya, the son of King Parikshita of the Kuru dynasty was performing a snake sacrifice known as Sarpa Satra, to avenge for the death of his father from a snake bite by the snake king called Takshaka.

A sacrificial fireplace had been specially erected and the fire sacrifice to kill all snakes in the world was started by a galaxy of learned Brahmin sages. The sacrifice performed in the presence of Janamejaya was so powerful that it caused all snakes to fall into the Yagna kunda (sacrificial fire pit). When the priests found that only Takshaka who had bitten and killed Parikshita's father and had escaped to the nether world of Indra seeking his protection, the sages increased the tempo of reciting the mantras (spells) to drag Takshaka and also Indra to the sacrificial fire. Takshaka had coiled himself around Indra's cot but the force of the sacrificial yagna was so powerful that even Indra along with Takshaka were dragged towards the fire.
This scared the gods who then appealed to Goddess Manasa, the queen of the snakes, to intervene and resolve the crisis. She then requested her son Astika to go to the site of the yagna and appeal to Janamejaya to stop the Sarpa Satra yagna. Astika impressed Janamejaya with his knowledge of all the Sastras (scriptures) who granted him to seek a boon. It was then that Astika requested Janamejeya to stop the Sarpa Satra. Since the king was never known to refuse a boon given to a Brahmin, he relented, despite protests by the rishis performing the yagna. The yagna was then stopped and thus the lives of Indra and Takshaka and his other serpent race were spared. This day, according to the Hindu Calendar, happened to be Nadivardhini Panchami (the fifth day of the bright fortnight of the lunar month of Shravana during the monsoon season) and since then the day has been a festival day of the Naga as their life was spared on this day. Indra also went to Manasadevi and worshipped her.
According to the Garuda Purana, offering prayers to sa nake on this day is auspicious and will usher good tidings in one's life. This is to be followed by feeding Brahmins.

Worship
On the day of Naga Panchami, Naga, cobras, and snakes are worshipped with milk, sweets, flowers, lamps, and even sacrifices. Naga or serpent deities made of silver, stone, wood, or paintings on the wall are first bathed with water and milk and then worshipped with the reciting of the following mantras.

Fasting is observed on this day and Brahmins are fed. The piety observed on this day is considered a sure protection against the fear of snake bite. At many places, real snakes are worshipped and fairs held. On this day digging the earth is taboo as it could kill or harm snakes which reside in the earth.

In some regions of the country milk is offered along with crystallized sugar, rice pudding. A special feature is of offering a lotus flower which is placed in a silver bowl. In front of this bowl, a rangoli (coloured design pattern) of snake is created on the floor with a brush made of wood or clay or silver or gold with sandalwood or turmeric paste as the paint. The design pattern will resemble a five hooded snake. Devotees then offer worship to this image on the floor. In villages, the anthills where the snakes are thought to reside, are searched. Incense is offered to the anthill as prayer along with milk (a myth of folk lore to feed milk to the snakes) to ensnare snakes to come out of the anthill. After this, milk is poured into the hole in the anthill as a libation to the snake god.
On this occasion doorways and walls outside the house are painted with pictures of snakes, auspicious mantras (spells) are also written on them. It is believed that such depictions will ward off poisonous snakes.
Naga Panchami is also the occasion observed as Bhratru Panchami when women with brothers worship snakes and its holes, and offer prayers to propitiate Naga so that their brothers are protected and do not suffer or die due to snake bite.
Naga Panchami is also celebrated as Vishari Puja or Bishari Puja in some parts of the country and Bisha or Visha means ""poison"".

Folktales
Apart from the scriptural mention about snakes and the festival, there are also many folktales. One such tale is of a farmer living in a village. He had two sons and one of whom killed three snakes during ploughing operations. The mother of  the  snake  took revenge on the same night by biting the farmer, his wife and two children and they all died. The following day the farmer's only surviving daughter, distraught and grieved by the death of her parents and brothers, pleaded before the mother snake with an offering of a bowl of milk and requested for forgiveness and to restore the life of her parents and brothers. Pleased with this offering the snake pardoned them and restored the farmer and his family to life.
In folklore, snakes also refer to the rainy season - the varsha ritu in Sanskrit. They are also depicted as deities of ponds and rivers and are said to be the embodiment of water as they spring out of their holes, like a spring of water.

Regional traditions
As it is believed that snakes have more powers than humans and on account of its association with Shiva, Devi, Vishnu and Subramanya, a degree of fear is instilled resulting in deification of the cobra and its worship throughout the country by Hindus.
Snake has connotation with the Moon’s nodes known in Hindu astrology. The head of the snake is represented by Rahu (""Dragon's head"") and its tail by Ketu (""Dragon's tail""). If in the zodiacal chart of an individual all the seven major planets are hemmed between Rahu and Ketu in the reverse order (anticlockwise) it is said to denote Kalasarpa dosha (Defect due to black snakes), which forebodes ill luck and hardship in an individual's life and therefore appeased by offering worship to the snakes on Naga Panchami day.

Central India
In Central India, in Nagapur, Maharashtra State snakes have special identity. The name of the city is derived from the word Naga which means snake as the place was infested with snakes. Nagapur was the homeland of 'Naga' people who embraced Buddhism, supported it with great efforts in its early period, and propagated it throughout India. Nagaoba Temple in Mahal is where worship is offered on Naga Panchami day; the temple was found under the neem tree known as “Nagaoba ka vota"", under a platform. Another important event held on this occasion is an arduous trekking pilgrimage known as Nagadwar Yatra to Pachmarhi. On this occasion food prepared as offering to the snake god is cooked in a kadai.

Naga Chandreshwar Ujjain
This is a sub temple located in the third floor of Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga temple in Ujjain. The speciality of this shrine is it is open only one day of the year on Naga Panchami day and remains shut on the rest of the year. The murthy of Nagachandreshwar is unique with Shiva and Parvati seated on ten hooded snake surrounded by Nandhi Ganesha and other murthies. It is believed that the great snake Taksha lives here and praying during Naga Panchami rids the devotee of various afflications and doshas such as Naga Dosha, Sarpa Dosha and any form of Doshas.

North and Northwestern India
Naga Panchami is celebrated all over North India. In Kashmir, from historical times snakes have been worshipped by Hindus, and the places of worship are reported as 700.
In north western India, in cities such as Benares, it is the time when Akharas (venues of wrestling practice and competitions) as part of Naga Panchami celebrations are bedecked; on this occasion the ahkaras are cleaned up thoroughly and walls painted with images of snakes, priests preside, and the gurus are honoured along with the sponsors. Its significance is that the wrestlers stand for virility and Naga symbolizes this “scheme of virility”. Akharas are decorated with snake images showing snakes drinking milk.
In Narasinghgarh akhara in Varanasi there is special shrine dedicated to Naga Raja (King of Snakes) where a bowl is suspended above the image of the snake and milk is poured into it so that it trickle over the snake god as a form of an offering.
On this day snake charmers are everywhere in towns and villages displaying snakes in their baskets which will have all types of snakes such as pythons, rat snakes, and cobras mingled together. Some of the snake charmers hang limp snakes around their neck and crowds gather to witness these scenes. The snakes in the basket are also worshipped on the occasion.
However, in Punjab this festival is celebrated in a different month and in a different format, in the month of Bhadra (September–October) and is called Guga Nauvami (ninth day of lunar month during bright half of Moon). On this occasion an image of snake is made with dough and kept in a “winnowing basket” and taken round the village.  Villagers offer flour and butter as oblation to the image. At the end of the parade, the snake is formally buried and women worship the snake for nine days and give offering of curds.

Western India
As in the rest of the country, the Naga Panchmi is celebrated in Western India and is known as the Ketarpal or Kshetrapal, meaning, a protector of his domain.
In this part of the country, snake is named Bhujang, which is also the Sanskrit name for snake, in the Kutch region. The name is attributed to the city of Bhuj which is located below the hill named Bhujiya, after Bhujang, as it was the abode of snakes. On top of this hill there is a fort known as the Bhujia Fort where a temple has been built for the snake god and a second temple is at the foot of the hill known as Nani Devi.
Bhujia Fort was the scene of a major battle between Deshalji I, the ruler of Kutch and Sher Buland Khan, Mughal Viceroy of Gujarat who had invaded Kutch. It was the early period of Deshalji's reign. When the army of Kutch was in a state of losing the battle, a group of Naga Bawas opened the gate of Bhujia Fort by a clever ploy of visiting Naga temple for worship and joined the fray against Sher Buland Khan's army. Eventually Deshalji I won the battle. Since that day Naga Bawa and their leader have a pride of place in the procession held on Naga Panchami day.
Within the fort, at one corner, there is a small square tower dedicated to Bhujang Naga (snake god), who in folklore is said to have been the brother of SheshNaga. It is said Bhujang Naga came from Than of Kathiawar and freed Kutch from the oppression of demons known as daityas and rakshasas. The Snake Temple was also built at the time of the fortification of the hill during Deshalji I's reign and provided with a chhatri. Every year on Naga Panchami day a fair is held at the temple premises. In the Sindhi community Naga Panchami is celebrated in honour of Gogro.

Eastern and Northeastern India
In eastern and north eastern States of India such as West Bengal,Jharkhand Orissa and Assam, the goddess is worshipped as Manasa. According to the Hindu mythology, Manasa is a snake goddess who was also called Jaratkaru and wife of Brahmin sage also named Jaratkaru. On this occasion, sh twig of manasa so sale plant (euphorbia lingularum) symbolizing the goddess Manasa is fixed on the ground and worshipped, not only in the month of Shravan, as in the rest of the country, but also in the month Bhadra Masa. Festival is held within the precincts of the house.

South India
In South India, snake is identified with Subramanya (Commander of the celestial army) and also with Shiva and Vishnu.
In Karnataka, the preparation for the festival starts on the New Moon day of Bhimana Amavasya, five days prior to the festival day of Panchami. Girls offer prayers to the images made out of white clay painted with white dots. They take a vow by tying a thread dipped in turmeric paste on their right wrist and offer prayers. An image of snake is drawn on the floor in front of the house and milk is offered as oblation. On the night previous to the festival they keep complete fast or take a salt free diet. After the pooja, a food feast is held.
In South India, both sculpted and live snakes are worshipped. Every village has a serpent deity. It is worshipped as a single snake or nine snakes called Nava Naga but the popular form is of two snakes in the form of an “Aesculapian rod”. Every worshipper in South India worships the anthill where the snakes are reported to reside. Women decorate the anthill with turmeric paste and vermillion and sugar mixed with wheat flour. They bedeck it with flowers with the help of threads tied to wooden frames. In Maharashtra, they go round the anthill in a worship mode five times singing songs in praise of snake gods.
Another form of worship practiced by women, who have no children for various reasons, install stone statues of snakes below the peepal tree and offer worship seeking blessings of the snake god for bestowing them with children. This is done as it is believed snakes represent virility and have the gift of inducing fecundity curing barrenness.
In Coorg in Karnataka, an ancestral platform called noka is installed with rough stones which are believed to be the ancestral incarnation in the form of snakes but they are not necessarily worshipped on Naga Panchami day.

History
Beginnings
Various views exist on the origins of the wari (Marathi: पंढरपूरची वारी or वारी). According to one theory, Vitthalpant, the father of the Varkari saint Dnyaneshwar, began the wari to visit Pandharpur in the Hindu months of Ashadha and Kartik. The tradition of performing a Wari is generally regarded to have existed for more than 800 years.
Another theory credits Dnyaneshwar and Tukaram to have started the pilgrimage. They used to take a journey to Pandharpur by foot for 15 days, reaching Pandharpur's Vithoba Temple on Shayani Ekadashi. The tradition of carrying the paduka of the saints was started by the Tukaram's youngest son, Narayan Maharaj, in 1685.

British era
Changes were brought to the pilgrimage in the 1820s by Tukaram's descendants and a devotee of Dnyaneshwar named Haibatravbaba Arphalkar, who was a courtier of the Scindias. Haibatravbaba is credited with the organization of the wari in use today. This involved carrying the paduka in a palkhi, having horses involved in the procession, and organizing the devotees or varkaris in Dindis (Dindi stands for a specific group of varkaris).

Wari in present times
The Warkaris—whose patron deity is Vithoba—undertake the wari to Pandharpur, reaching there on a day before Shayani Ekadashi, the eleventh lunar day (Ekadashi) of the bright fortnight (Shukla Paksha) of Ashadha (June–July). Pilgrims carry palanquins of the saints from the places of their respective samadhi.

Dindi
The concept of Dindi (Marathi: दिंडी procession) or troupes of warkari devotees was introduced by Haibatravbaba in the early 1800s. A diṇḍī is a group of Hindu devotees of one caste or village who are part of a larger palkhi going to a holy site on pilgrimage. Some religious institutions and temples also have their own Dindi. Accommodation, meals and other facilities to warkaris are provided through their respective Dindi. Managing members of a Dindi usually travel ahead to make arrangements for food and shelter at their next stop. All registered Dindis are numbered and assigned their place in the procession. Some walk in front of the palkhi and others behind it. During their march, flag and banner-carrying members are at the front of the troupe, and the drummer is at the center of the Dindi.
Along with the procession, sevā is performed for the poor and needy, like dāna.
The event is said to be one of the world's largest and oldest movement where people gather on one day each year and walk a distance of around 250 km. The Pandharpur Wari has been classified by the World Book of Records as ""one of the most visited places in a day"".

Wari management
The Dnyaneshwar palkhi is managed by Haibatraobua Arphalkar's descendants, the hereditary Chopdars, and the Alandi Devasthan Trust.
The wari's schedule is published ahead of time and is strictly followed. It is detailed and minute details are made available, including starting location and the location of breaks, including lunch, rest and night stays. Every morning at early dawn, after worshiping the Saint's footwear, the palkhi leaves at 6am for the next stretch of the route. A tutari (wind instrument) is blown thrice to alert all Warkaris. At the first signal, all warkaris get ready to leave. At the second signal, the Dindis stand in line and start walking at the third signal. After 4 to 5 km, they take a quick break for breakfast.

Economic impact
An estimated one million pilgrims, either varkaris traveling with the palkhi or independent travelers, travel to Pandharpur each year, who require accommodation provided by the mathas and temporary lodging houses.

Public health measures
Because the wari brings many people on the way to Pandharpur through many localities, public health measures have been implemented since the early British colonial period. These included compulsory vaccinations for diseases, such as cholera and plague, segregation of the infected, and restrictions on mobility. According to Manjiri Kamat, the colonial administrators had other motivations, such as generating revenue by collecting pilgrim tax, or maintaining law and order for implementing public health measures. The colonial government's public health measures in the early part of the 20th century included attaching medical staff to different palkhis, removing infected persons, modifying wells for drinking water, digging trenches, providing bins for waste collection, and employing sanitation staff. The requirement to be vaccinated against cholera and typhoid in order to join a dindi has continued in the present times.
In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the wari was reduced with fifty varkaris joining the march to Pandharpur. The paduka of the saints were either driven to or flown to Pandharpur for Shayani Ekadashi on July 1, 2020.

Goa Dindi festival
The Dindi festival is an annual festival held in Margao, Goa's Vitthal Rakhumai temple, and the Damodar Temple in the month of November. The Dindi festival is dedicated to Hindu deity Vithoba, the festival dates back to 1909. It is one of the oldest festivals in Salcete(Margao) taluka.

To participate in this divine dance, Shiva took the form of Gopīśvara Mahādevā. Vivid descriptions of this night are given in the Brahma Purana, Skanda Purana, Brahma Vaivarta Purana, and the Linga Purana. It is also believed that, on this full moon night, the goddess Lakshmi descends on the earth to watch the actions of human beings.

Celebrations in India
Bengal, Assam & Tripura
In Bengal, Tripura, Assam and Mithila the night is known as Kojagari Purnima. Kojagari translates to 'one who is awake' in Bengali. It is believed that Goddess Lakshmi visits people's houses on this night, checks whether they are staying awake, and blesses them only if they are awake.In northern and central states of India, such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, kheer is prepared during the night and kept under the moonlight in an open roofed space overnight. It is believed that on this night, moon rays carry amrita (elixir of immortality), which is collected in the kheer. The kheer is then eaten as a prasad on the next day. Also, goddess Lakshmi is worshipped on this night.
For some Bengali tribes, the day is celebrated a few days before or after the exact day, especially in the  Dyao,  Brahmo, and  Cumulang traditions, as per various traditions determining which days are auspicious for celebration.
In Maharashtra, it is popularly known as Kojagiri Paurnima. People make masala milk and keep it outside under the moonlight, as moon rays are believed to carry amrita.

Unmarried women worship the moon on the occasion of this festival. The puja starts in the early morning when the moon sets with new dress. A kula (a basket made of woven bamboo strips) is filled with rice puffs, sugarcane, betel leaves, betel nuts, cucumbers, coconuts, and seven other fruits such as apples or bananas. In the evening the full moon is worshiped again, and worshippers break their fast by preparing a dish containing the fried paddy and fruits from the kula, along with curd and jaggery and offer it to the moon god before a tulsi plant. After this, maidens play games and sing songs under the light of the full moon.

This occasion is holy to Vaishnavas, the followers of the Hindu preserver deity, Vishnu, as it is regarded to be the day the deity's sleep commences.

Significance
On this day images of Vishnu and Lakshmi are worshipped, the night is spent singing prayers, and devotees fast and take vows on this day, to be observed during the entire chaturmasya, the holy four-month period of rainy season. These may include, giving up a food item or fasting on every Ekadashi day.
It is believed that Vishnu falls asleep in Kshira Sagara - the cosmic ocean of milk - on Shesha, the cosmic serpent. Vishnu finally awakens from his slumber four months later on Prabodhini Ekadashi - eleventh day of bright fortnight in the Hindu month Kartika (October–November). This period is known as Chaturmasya (lit. ""four months"") and coincides with the rainy season. Shayani Ekadashi is the beginning of the Chaturmasya. Devotees start observing the Chaturmasya vrata (vow) to please Vishnu on this day.
A fast is observed on Shayani Ekadashi. The fast demands abstinence from all grains, beans, and cereals, as well as certain vegetables, including onions and certain spices.

Legend
In the Bhavishyottara Purana, Krishna narrates significance of Shayani Ekadashi to Yudhishthira, as the creator-god Brahma narrated the significance to his son Narada once. The story of King Mandata is narrated in this context. The pious king's country had faced drought for three years, but the king was unable to find a solution to please the rain gods. Eventually, sage Angiras advised the king to observe the vrata (vow) of Devashayani Ekadashi. On doing so, by the grace of Vishnu, there was rain in the kingdom.

Pandharpur Yatra
This day, a huge yatra or religious procession of pilgrims known as Pandharpur Ashadi Ekadasi Waari Yatra culminates at Pandharpur, in Solapur district in south Maharashtra, situated on the banks of the Chandrabhaga River. Pandharpur is main center of worship of the deity Vitthala, a local form of Vishnu. Lakhs (hundreds of thousands) of pilgrims come to Pandharpur on this day from different parts of Maharashtra. Some of them carry Palkhis (palanquins) with the images of the saints of Maharashtra. Dnyaneshwar's image is carried from Alandi, Namdev's image from Narsi Namdev, Tukaram's from Dehu, Eknath's from Paithan, Nivruttinath's from Trimbakeshwar, Muktabai's from Muktainagar, Sopan's from Sasvad and Gajanan Maharaj's from Shegaon. These pilgrims are referred to as Warkaris. They sing Abhangas (chanting hymns) of Saint Tukaram and Saint Dnyaneshwar, dedicated to Vitthala.

It also falls sometimes on the day after Amavasya with 27th Nakshatra Revati. Ugadi day is pivoted on the first New Moon after March Equinox.
The day is observed by drawing colourful patterns on the floor called Muggulu/ Rangoli, mango leaf decorations on doors called torana, buying and giving gifts such as new clothes, giving charity to the poor, oil massages followed by special baths, preparing and sharing a special food called pachadi, and visiting Hindu temples.

Etymology
The name Yugadi or Ugadi is derived from the Sanskrit words yuga (age) and ādi (beginning): ""the beginning of a new age"". Yugadi or Ugadi falls on ""Chaitra Shudhdha Paadyami"" or the first day of the bright half of the Indian month of Chaitra. This generally falls in late March or early April of the Gregorian calendar.
The Telugu people use the term Ugadi (ఉగాది) and the Kannadigas use the term Yugadi (ಯುಗಾದಿ) for this festival.

Practices
The Kannada and Telugu communities in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu celebrate the festival with great fanfare; gatherings of the extended family and a sumptuous feast are 'de rigueur'. The day begins early with ritual showers, rubbing the body with perfumed oil, followed by prayers.

Preparations for the festival begin a week ahead. Houses are given a thorough clean. People buy new clothes, including dhoti, and buy new items for the festival, decorate the entrance of their houses with fresh mango leaves. Mango leaves and coconuts are considered auspicious in the Hindu tradition, and they are used on Ugadi. People also clean the front of their house with water and cow dung paste, then draw colorful floral designs. People offer prayers in temples. The celebration of Ugadi is marked by religious zeal and social merriment. According to Vasudha Narayanan, a professor of Religion at the University of Florida:

The pacchadi festive dish symbolically reminds the people that the following year – as all of life – will consist of not just sweet experiences, but a combination of sweet, sour, salty, and bitter episodes. Just as the different substances are bound together, one is reminded that no event or episode is wholly good or bad. Even in the midst of bitter experiences, there are sweet moments. One is also reminded that the experience of taste is transitory and ephemeral; so too, is life, and one has to learn to put pain and pleasure in proper temporal perspective.

Special dishes are prepared for the occasion. In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, foods such as pulihora, bobbatlu (Bhakshalu/ polelu/ oligale), New Year Burelu and Pachadi, and preparations made with raw mango go well with the occasion. Of these, pachadi (or Ugadi pacchadi) is the most notable, and consists of a chutney-like dish which combines ingredients to give all six flavours of food : sweet, sour, salty, spicy, bitter and astringent. This festive Hindu food is made from tamarind paste (sour), neem flowers (bitter), brown sugar or sweet jaggery (sweet), table salt (salt), green chilli (spicy) and raw mango (astringent). It is a symbolic reminder of complex phases of life one should reasonably expect in the new year.
In Karnataka, foods such as Holige or Obattu, and mango pickles are made. In addition, a speciality of yugadi in Karnataka is to create ""bEvu-bella"" a mixture of neem and jaggery, to signify both the sweet and the bitter or the sihi-kahi(ಸಿಹಿ-ಕಹಿ). This symbolizes life's own experiences with a little bit of bitterness and a hint of sweetness.

On this Purnima (full moon) during the three days of the month of Jyeshtha in the Hindu calendar (which falls in May–June in the Gregorian calendar), a married woman marks her love for her husband by tying a ceremonial thread around a banyan tree. The celebration is based on the legend of Savitri and Satyavan as narrated in the epic Mahabharata.

History
The legends dates back to a story in the age of Mahabharata. The childless king Asvapati and his consort Malavi wish to have a son. Finally, the God Savitr appears and tells him he will soon have a daughter. The king is overjoyed at the prospect of a child. She is born and named Savitri in honor of the god.

She is so beautiful and pure, and intimidates all the men in her village that no man will ask for her hand in marriage. Her father tells her to find a husband on her own. She sets out on a pilgrimage for this purpose and finds Satyavan, the son of a blind king named Dyumatsena who lives in exile as a forest-dweller. Savitri returns to find her father speaking with Sage Narada who tells her she has made a bad choice: although perfect in every way, Satyavan is destined to die one year from that day. Savitri insists on going ahead and marries Satyavan.
Three days before the foreseen death of Satyavan, Savitri takes a vow of fasting and vigil. Her father-in-law tells her she has taken on too harsh a regimen, but she replies that she has taken an oath to perform the regimen and Dyumatsena offers his support. The morning of Satyavan’s predicted death, he is splitting wood and suddenly becomes weak and lays his head in Savitri’s lap and dies. Savitri places his body under the shade of a Vat (Banyan) tree. Yama, the god of Death, comes to claim Satyavan's soul. As Yama takes Satyavan's soul, Savitri follows stating that is her duty as a wife to follow her husband. Hearing this, Yama grants her a few wishes, with the exception of asking for her husband's life.  
She first asks for eyesight and restoration of the kingdom for her father-in-law, then a hundred children for her father, and then a hundred children for herself and Satyavan. The last wish creates a dilemma for Yama, as it would indirectly grant the life of Satyavan. However, impressed by Savitri's dedication and purity, he offers her one more chance to choose any boon, but this time omitting ""except for the life of Satyavan"". Savitri instantly asks for Satyavan to return to life. Yama grants life to Satyavan and blesses Savitri's life with eternal happiness.
Satyavan awakens as though he has been in a deep sleep and returns to his parents along with his wife. Meanwhile, at their home, Dyumatsena regains his eyesight before Savitri and Satyavan return. Since Satyavan still does not know what happened, Savitri relays the story to her parents-in-law, husband, and the gathered ascetics. As they praise her, Dyumatsena’s ministers arrive with news of the death of his usurper. Joyfully, the king and his entourage return to his kingdom.
Though the tree does not play a significant role of the story, it is worshiped in memory of the love in the legend.

Festival
Vat Purnima in English means a full moon related to the banyan tree. It is a Hindu festival celebrated strictly in the Northern and Western Indian states Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Goa, and Gujarat.  The period of the festival is observed over three days, usually the 13th, 14th and 15th days in the month of Jestha (May–June). Women observe a fast and tie threads around a banyan tree and pray for the well-being of their husbands.

Fast and tradition
On the occasion of Vat Purnima, women keep a fast of three days for their husbands, as Savitri did. During the three days, pictures of a Vat (banyan) tree, Savitri, Satyavan, and Yama, are drawn with a paste of sandalwood and rice on the floor or a wall in the home. The golden engravings of the couple are placed in a tray of sand, and worshiped with mantras (chanting), and Vat leaves. Outdoors, the banyan tree is worshiped. A thread is wound around the trunk of the tree, and copper coins are offered. Strict adherence to the fast and tradition is believed to ensure the husband a long and prosperous life. During the fast, women greet each other with ""जन्म सावित्री हो"" (English: ""Become a Savitri""). It is believed that until the next seven births their husband will live well.
B. A. Gupte provides a Pauranic excerpt to suggest that the mythology behind the festival is symbolic of natural phenomena. He notes that it is the representation of the annual marriage of the earth and nature represented by Satyavan and Savitri. It is like the way the earth dies every year and is rejuvenated by the powers of nature. He points out that the Vat tree was likely chosen due to the mythological aspects connected to the tree that are known to Indians.
In the present day, the festival is celebrated in the following way. Women dress in fine sarees and jewelry, and their day begins with the offering of any five fruits and a coconut. Each woman winds white thread around a banyan tree seven times as a reminder of their husbands. They fast for the whole day.

A gotmar (stone throwing) fair, located between Sawargaon (Savargaon) village and the town of Pandhurna, is organized every year along its banks.

Course
The river originates through a convergence of several rivulets and streams flowing down the hill slopes situated around Chilhati village in the Betul District in Madhya Pradesh at an altitude of 762m.
Snaking along eastwards the river enters the Chhindwara District where it flows mostly in the Sausar region, and hits flatter terrain where it collects two rivers, each of them being spill offs from dams. The first one is the overflow stream from an earthen dam located near Mandvi. The other, longer of the two streams, flows out from the Borgaon Dam, runs parallel to NH69, and merges with Jam river at Teegaon. Here the river widens out and continues its run southeast of the town receiving another tributary on its left bank near the village Chichkheda. It travels through the outskirts of the town Pandhurna changing course to run in an eastward fashion. Just before reaching the village Jam, it receives its largest tributary River Sarpini. From here the river again flows southeast-ward passing the town of Lodhikheda and ends its course by entering the Kanhan River below Razhadi Borgaon, at the village of Sangam (literally 'confluence').
The river flows only during the monsoon season.

History
In 1999 forty-nine people drowned in the Jam River when a bus was swept away trying to cross the Jam River.  In response to this incident, the Rajiv Gandhi bridge was built in Saunsar tehsil.

It is a post harvest festival celebrated to thank the God Tingkao Ragwang for a good harvest season and heralds the beginning of a new year. The festival is celebrated for five days with various rituals, prayers and festivities such as music, dance and feast accompanying the same.

Etymology
Gaan-Ngai translates to ""winter festival"" in the Zemeic languages with Gaan meaning ""winter"" or ""dry season"" and Ngai meaning festival.

Background
According to legend and folklore, life began after the creation of the universe including earth by Tingkao Ragwang, the creator and almighty god. Gods and humans shared a common dormitory called khangchu in the house of Tingpu Rengsonnang, where they were not on friendly terms and men were often at the mercy of gods. Later, some of the men appeared in the physical form of khodiai (bee) and bit the gods, which led to the gods fleeing away.
Cooked rice on paddy plants was granted to be readily consumed as a food. There was abundance of rice, so that there was always surplus after consumption. While humans achieved peace initially, they multiplied as ages passed and the cooked rice was no more available post the fleeing of the gods. Thingpu Rengsonnang, the householder of the dormitory, visited the surroundings and found fertile soil, conducive for vegetation and proclaimed that the villagers should go for cultivation. As only raw rice could be obtained from paddy, they prayed to Tingkao Rangwang for help. After a long time of prayers, they saw smoke emanating from the ground, which was generated from a earthen pot in which a fire was burning. The fire was used to cook the raw rice and the humans were able to consume cooked rice again. The festival is celebrated as to commemorate the coming of light or fire.

Gaan-Ngai is celebrated on the 13th day of the month of Wakching of the Metei Manipuri calendar. The Kabui Naga people celebrate the Gang Ngai festival during the month of Gaan Bu.

Interpretations of meaning
Elangbam Nilakanta Singh translates Lai Haraoba as the “merry making of the gods and goddesses,” and many others use this meaning. Saroj Nalini Parratt and John Parratt translate it as “pleasing of the gods,” based on J. Shakespeare’s (1913) translation, but they make it plural because the festival honors more than one god. Practitioners of the ritual say that the name comes from the ""lai hoi laoba,"" the cry of ‘hoi’, in the Meitei creation myth, which marks the moment the universe is revealed. This idea is given by Ng. Kulachandra, the former head of the Manipur Pandit Loishang.

Origin
Lai Haraoba (Meitei: ꯂꯥꯏ ꯍꯔꯥꯎꯕ) is a ritualistic festival of the Meiteis observed since ancient times. It is a ritual enactment of the creation myth. It mirrors the entire culture of Manipur and depicts the close affinities between the hill and plain people. It is a combination of religious recitations, traditional music and dance, traditional social values and ancient cultural aspects.
The rituals within the festival are the same except in some items or hymns, such as ikouba, ikourol, and yakairol at the beginning and mikon thagonba, ngaprum tanba at the end of the festival. In the performances, the evolution story with the amorous love-affairs of Nongpok Ninghthou and Panthoibi is depicted and played equally in all kinds of lai haraoba. According to folklore, the gods held the first Lai Haraoba  on the Koubru Hill so that their descendants would imitate them by performing the same rites.

Places and timings
Lai Haraoba takes place at local shrines dedicated to the Umang Lai deities, which are important to the traditional Meitei religion. The festival doesn't have fixed dates but happens between February and May or June. Each shrine chooses its own dates for the festival. The festival can last from three days to over a month, depending on the shrine. The dates and length of the festival can be different for each shrine.

Deities
The Lai Haraoba is also called the Umang Lai Haraoba, named after the Umang Lai deities, honored during the festival. These deities are seen as protectors of the areas where the shrines are located. The festival takes place at these shrines, and the whole community helps with the preparations.
The Umang Lai group includes over 300 deities, such as ancestors, legendary forefathers, and other important gods in the traditional Meitei religion (Sanamahism).

Male and female aspects
The rituals of Lai Haraoba honor a male and a female deity, called Lainingthou and Lairembi/Lairemma. The rituals focus on creation. The Meitei people believe that the supreme god created the cosmos. He is called Tengbanba Mapu or Taibangpanba Mapu or Atiya Sidaba. Some creation stories start with these gods, while others go back to Atingkok and Amamba. Amamba is the dark place where life begins.

Types and variations
Four types of Lai Haraoba are prevalent in the Meitei society, namely, Kanglei Haraoba, Moirang Haraoba, Kakching Haraoba and Chakpa Haraoba. Kanglei Haraoba is performed mainly in Imphal and the nearby towns. Moirang Haraoba is only in Moirang, Kakching Haraoba is held in Kakching and Chakpa Haraoba is celebrated at Andro, Phayeng, Sekmai, Koutruk, Khuukhul, Leimaram and Tairenpokpi.

Kanglei Haraoba
One type of Lai Haraoba is Kanglei Haraoba, celebrated in and around Imphal. The name Kanglei comes from Kangla, which is in the center of Imphal. The main deity worshipped is Pakhangba. A special part of this festival is when Khoriphaba, a deity, looks for a ‘bride’. A maibi (spirit medium) calls on Khoriphaba's spirit to choose the bride. The festival ends with the nongarol, which shows the rise of the divine presence.

Moirang Haraoba
Moirang Haraoba is celebrated in and around the Moirang region in the southern part of the Imphal valley. The main deity worshipped is Thangching (Thangjing). In this version, along with langthrei leaves (a common offering in the Kanglei version), leisang, another evergreen plant, is also offered. A special part of this festival is the Khamba Thoibi classical dance. The festival ends with tengtharol (a song of lamentation), which marks the rise of the deities.

Chakpa Haraoba
Chakpa Haraoba is not a separate type of the festival, but a group of versions celebrated by Chakpa groups in different villages. The hand movements are simpler, and the structure is less complex. It includes sacrificial practices. The main versions are from Andro, Imphal East and Phayeng villages. In Andro, a special ritual called Numit Kappa (shooting of the sun) is performed, which is unique to them. The Phayeng tradition has special rituals, like ""Lai Phagi Tounaba,"" which are not done in other places.

Kakching Haraoba
Kakching Haraoba is celebrated in the Kakching region, east of Imphal. A special part of the festival is the ""Ngaprum Tanba"" ritual (hunting of eel) on the last day. People have different opinions on whether it should be a separate type of festival. Some think it should be part of Kanglei, while others think it should be under Chakpa Haraoba. Dr. Kh. Ratankumar Singh sees it as a separate type. However, each shrine often has its own unique practices.

Rituals
The Lai Haraoba rituals are led by special people. There are three old traditions. The three traditions are maiba, maibi, and asheiba (pena (musical instrument) is about the music with a special fiddle). Only men can follow maiba and asheiba. Only women can follow maibi, which is about connecting with spirits.
The Lai Haraoba rituals are detailed and cover many parts. They can be divided into three parts. These parts are the beginning, the middle, and the end. The parts are called Lai Eekouba, Haraoba, and Lairoi respectively. The Lai Eekouba marks the descent of the god (Lai in Meitei language). The Lairoi marks the ascent. The days in between follow a similar pattern. The number of days in between can change. This makes the festival last anywhere from three days to over three weeks.

Lai Eekouba
The Lai Eekouba rituals focus on bringing a sacred presence into the shrine for the festival. Before the rituals, the doors of the shrine, which are usually closed all year, are opened. This is called ""lai thong hangba,"" meaning ""opening of the shrine doors."" It happens on a lucky day before the Eekouba rituals. After opening, the shrine is cleaned, and sacred images and objects are prepared. The utensils are cleaned, clothes for the ceremonies are washed, and the sacred images are taken out. Sometimes, preparations begin even before opening the shrine, like making rice beer for the event. This process is done with special songs and rituals.
In the Eekouba ritual, the sacred presence is brought through water. This is done at a pond or river. A procession goes from the shrine to the water. There, offerings are made and deities are called. A maibi performs the ritual by chanting and ringing bells. The maibi may go into a trance and speak messages from the spirits. The sacred objects come to life during this time. Afterward, the procession returns to the shrine, and the objects are placed in their spots. The day ends with the pena (musical instrument) fiddle player, who plays music and sings to rest the deities for the night, with a rite called ""naosumba"". This is the first day of the festival.

Haraoba
The second day starts with the awakening rite (yakeiba). The pena fiddle player plays in the morning to wake up the deity. Some rituals are done, like bathing (iru sadengba) and removing bad energies (anam-aha kokpa). People bring fruits, rice, grains, flowers, incense, and candles as offerings. The morning prayers are recited, and the offerings are given.
The main ritual happens in the evening. Music and dance are an important part of it. They are not just for performance, but part of the ritual. The evening starts with offering flowers, called ""Lei Langba."" The person in charge of the flowers or their helper does this. The maibis show respect before starting the dance of Thougal Jagoi. This dance is a way to honor the Lai and get ready for the day’s work. The songs in the dance praise the deity. The maibis lead the dance, and everyone in the community can join. After the dance, the Laibou part of the ritual starts.

Laibou
The laibou rituals are the main part of the Lai Haraoba. Before this, a banana leaf with a small offering and sacred langthrei leaves are placed in the center of the area. The maibis then dance to bring the sacred presence into the space. This dance is called Laiching Jagoi, or ""the dance to draw out the deities."" The dance is accompanied only by the sound of the pena (musical instrument) fiddle, with no singing. After the dance, everyone shouts ""hoi"" together in a song called hoi laoba. They follow the maiba’s lead. The singing style is similar to the closing song, wakol laoba, but it is different from other ritual songs. This singing style is called ""antiphonal songs,"" which is different from other ritual songs.
The laibou rituals are performed in a procession that goes around the performance area. The rituals symbolize the creation of the human body, birth, building a house, farming, and weaving. The procession, led by the maibi, starts in front of the shrine and moves around the area, showing respect to the four directions and their deities.
The dance begins with the creation of the body. The maibi dances to show how each part of the body is made, like carving the eyes, drawing the brows, and marking the soles of the feet. Then, the baby is 'born' and cared for. As the child grows, clothing is needed. To make clothes, the hillside is cleared to grow cotton, which is then processed and woven. To protect the child, a house is built, with frames made and mud used to plaster the walls. When the child grows older, they go fishing, which symbolizes physical desires. Throughout this ritual, there are clear references to everyday life and culture.

After Laibou
After the Laibou, the Padon Jagoi follows. In this, the maibis form a line, led by a senior maibi, and dance in a serpentine pattern in the performance area. Next, a series of rites takes place, focusing on the phibul (a ball of cloth) and the phijang, which is a piece of white cloth held by four poles. These four poles form a ritual umbrella and banners. The four corners of the cloth are held by the poles. Two maibis, each holding a sacred object, dance around the poles, moving under the cloth. After the rites, the cloth is gathered up and returned to the shrine. It is sometimes called as a part of the ritual ""canopy cycle.""
The day ends with the participants drawing serpentine patterns, called ""Lairen Mathek Chatpa."" Then, the sacred objects are put back in the shrine, and the Wakol song is sung. The deities are put to rest with a lullaby called Naosumba, played by the pena.

Special rites
Some rites are done only on certain days. One is the ""Saroi Khangba,"" where food is offered to lesser spirits. Another is the ""Kanglei Thokpa,"" where the spirit of the deity Khoriphaba is called. This is also known as ""Lai Nupi Thiba,"" meaning ""search for the bride."" A more visible rite is the ""Lai Lam-thokpa"" street procession, where the procession moves outside with a big celebration and many people.

Lairoi
The Lairoi rituals happen on the last day and mark the end of the festival. These rituals focus on closing the sacred time and space of Lai Haraoba. One ritual is ""Thang Jagoi,"" a dance with blades, performed by a maibi at the four corners to remove bad energies. Another ritual is Loutaba, also called Tangkhul-Nurabi, which is about two important mythological figures. Loutaba is like a skit with comedy, myths, chants, and some improvisation. Other closing rituals include Ougri Hangel, Thawai Mi-konba, Sharit Litpa, and Khencho Chongba.
The sacred presence is let go with the Lai Nongaba rite, marking its departure and return to the other realm. A boat is made for this journey. The Uyarol songs describe the tree being cut down, and the Hijing Hirao songs describe making the boat. The ascent is marked by the Higa Ishei hymn, and the ritual ends with the Nongarol hymn.
When returning to the shrine, the sacred images and items used in the ritual are taken apart, all on the same night. A Leihun offering of langthrei leaves is made, and the shrine doors are closed for five days. On the fifth day, the maibi comes back to remove the offering and prepare a new one. This final rite, called Leihun Tamba, ends the Lairoi rituals.

Lai Haraoba Ishei
Lai Haraoba Ishei is a famous folk song played mainly during Lai Haraoba. This song contains lyrics with veiled references to erotic mysticism. The main quality of the song is the rhythm in its tune.

Sports
In Lai Haraoba, the day after the Lairoi (last day of rituals) was for sports events. These events included many traditional Meitei games and sports. Some of the games were Yubi Lakpi, which is a traditional Meitei rugby and uses an oiled slippery coconut and oiled bodies. Another game was Khong Kangjei, which is a traditional Meitei hockey. Mukna is a traditional Meitei wrestling, and mukna-kangjei is a mix of wrestling and hockey. Thouri Chingnaba is a traditional Meitei tug of war.

Influences on other performing arts
Dance forms of Lai Haraoba helped create the Manipuri dance style and inspired the Manipuri Ras Lila, one of India's classical dances. The focus on dance has shaped how people see and talk about Lai Haraoba, both in Manipur and outside. But Lai Haraoba is more than just dance, music, or religion. It is an important part of the culture and has helped the Meitei people strengthen their identity, especially in relation to Hindu culture. The festival and its traditions show the Meitei view of the world and their values. It also reflects their material culture.

Backstory of the Mera Thaomei
Long ago, two brothers set out on a journey in search of a place to settle. The younger brother chose to settle in the valley, while the elder decided to make his home in the hills. As they parted ways, they comforted each other with a promise—to signal their well-being on the 15th lunar day of the Mera month. The brother in the valley would light a ꯊꯥꯎꯃꯩ  (thaomei) and hang it high on a bamboo pole so it could be seen from the hills, while the elder brother would light a fire on the hilltops for his sibling to see. Over time, this simple act of reassurance evolved into a cherished tradition, still observed today.

On the occasion of Ningol Chakkouba, the parents graciously receive their wedded daughters at their ""mapam,"" or paternal house, for a splendid feast.
The married women, adorned in their most exquisite traditional attire, arrive in the company of their children. They bestow upon their parents' gifts imbued with blessings for both the daughters and their progeny.
It is customary for the son of the family to extend a formal invitation to his sister a week in advance of the gathering.
Though devoid of specific religious connotations, this cherished social celebration serves to fortify the bonds of love and affection between married women and their familial ties. Moreover, it provides a delightful occasion for the reunion of family and friends, some of whom may have journeyed from distant locales.

Observance of the festival
First Offering ritual:
The Meitei people celebrates the festival with great fanfare; gatherings of the extended family and a sumptuous feast for lunch are 'de rigueur'. The day, begins with ritual offerings of fruits, vegetables, rice and other uncooked food items to the Meitei deity Lainingthou Sanamahi during the early morning of the festival. 
The preparation of the feast:
After getting blessings from Lainingthou Sanamahi, odd number of dishes ( basically 3, 5, 7 or 9 are prepared) are prepared using the offerings. Traditionally, the men of the house makes the dishes, with the women helping in chopping and washing the ingredients.
Second Offering ritual:
After the dishes for the feast are made, they are ritually offered at two different traditional locations around the house: one at the front gate of the house and the other at the rear gate of the house. These locations are specially cleansed and sanctified before the offering by cleaning an area (around 2x2 feet) and decorating it with mud, flowers and leaves. Traditionally, the eldest son of the house will make the offering to these three deities - Kumsana Kumliklai (Lord of the golden year), Lamsenba Tusenba (Guardian of the Land) and Lammaba Tumaba (Lord of the land) at this sanctified area. The offering traditionally includes: an odd number (chang taaba) of dishes surrounding a small mound of steamed rice, a token currency, fruits, flowers, a candle, and an incense stick, all of them placed upon a plantain leaf. This ritual is performed in the late morning. 
Feast:
After this ritual, the dishes prepared for the feast are exchange with relatives/neighbours and this custom is called ""Mathel Laanba"" after which the feast will start. It is believed that on the day of new year anything that happens on that day will happen for the rest of the year i.e. if you are happy and healthy on that day, you will be happy and healthy for the rest of the year. 
Ching Kāba: Hillock Climbing:
After the feast, it is tradition that family members climb a small hillock specially prepared by the community near the locality to pay homage to the hill deity, signifying the elevation of the spirit to reach the divine. The ""Chin-nga"" at Singjamei and ""Cheirao Ching"" at Chingmeirong are such hillocks that are specially prepared for these hillock climbing ritual. Toy shops, eateries, and other varied small shops will line the road to the hillock on that day to attract the ritual climbers to buy their items. The Ching Kāba is usually done during the afternoon to early evening, before the sun sets.

Origins and history
Chapchar Kut is estimated to have started in 1450–1700 A.D. in a village called Suaipui. The festival apparently originated when the hunters came back to the village empty handed, to make up for the disappointment, the Village chief proposed an impromptu feast with rice beer and meat.  
Since then, every year the festival had been repeated by the village of Suaipui and spread on to other villages.
Chapchar Kut was first revived in 1962 on a grand scale in Aizawl, however it was discouraged when it was felt that it did not adhere to Christian values and rekindling the pre Christian cultural practices like drinking of rice beer, however, it was continued in 1973 on a mass scale sans animistic practice and cheraw dance. Even the Church which had been critical of the festival no longer objected to the festival as it felt that traditional culture was disappearing. Chapchar Kut is now held annually in the Month of March. People dance, perform skits, play musical instruments to celebrate their beloved festival with the aims of bringing camaraderie among the people.

Celebration

Oral traditions say Chapchar Kut was first celebrated in Seipui village in adjoining Myanmar that has a sizeable population of Mizos and their ethnic cousins. Chapchar Kut used to be celebrated to thank the gods for saving the people from harm during the clearing of forest on hill slopes for jhum cultivation at the beginning of a year. The festival used to be observed with a lot of drinking and eating. On the first night the young men and women would dance all night. The women would come dressed wearing a Vakiria. Chai dance has its origins in this festival.
Today, the festival is observed in the last part of February or the early part of March when the trees and bamboos felled for jhum are left to dry and the shifting cultivators have time to relax and enjoy.
The Main activities which are done during the Chapchar Kut are:

Chhawnghnawh – A pre-Christian custom of stuffing a boiled eggs into each other's mouths.

Etymology
Gaan-Ngai translates to ""winter festival"" in the Zemeic languages with Gaan meaning ""winter"" or ""dry season"" and Ngai meaning festival.

Background
According to legend and folklore, life began after the creation of the universe including earth by Tingkao Ragwang, the creator and almighty god. Gods and humans shared a common dormitory called khangchu in the house of Tingpu Rengsonnang, where they were not on friendly terms and men were often at the mercy of gods. Later, some of the men appeared in the physical form of khodiai (bee) and bit the gods, which led to the gods fleeing away.
Cooked rice on paddy plants was granted to be readily consumed as a food. There was abundance of rice, so that there was always surplus after consumption. While humans achieved peace initially, they multiplied as ages passed and the cooked rice was no more available post the fleeing of the gods. Thingpu Rengsonnang, the householder of the dormitory, visited the surroundings and found fertile soil, conducive for vegetation and proclaimed that the villagers should go for cultivation. As only raw rice could be obtained from paddy, they prayed to Tingkao Rangwang for help. After a long time of prayers, they saw smoke emanating from the ground, which was generated from a earthen pot in which a fire was burning. The fire was used to cook the raw rice and the humans were able to consume cooked rice again. The festival is celebrated as to commemorate the coming of light or fire.

The festival represents all ethnic groups of Nagaland for which it is also called the Festival of Festivals.

Etymology
The festival is named after the hornbill, the large and colourful forest bird which is displayed in the folklore of most of the state's ethnic groups.

Background
The state of Nagaland is home to several ethnic groups, which have their own distinct festivals. More than 60% of the population of Nagaland depends on agriculture and therefore most of their festivals revolve around agriculture. The Nagas consider their festivals sacred, so participation in these festivals is essential.
To encourage inter-ethnic interaction and to promote cultural heritage of Nagaland, the Government of Nagaland organises the Hornbill Festival every year in the first week of December. The first festival was held in December 2000.

Celebrations
Organised by the Department of State Tourism and Department of Art & Culture, the Hornbill Festival showcases a mélange of cultural displays under one roof. This festival usually takes place between 1 and 10 December every year mainly in Kohima District.
The main venue of the Hornbill Festival is held at the Kisama Heritage Village located in the Southern Angami region of Kohima District which is about 12 km from Kohima. All the ethnic groups of Nagaland take part in this festival. The aim of the festival is to revive and protect the rich culture of Nagaland and display its extravaganza and traditions.

The Hornbill Festival provides a colourful mixture of dances, performances, crafts, parades, games, sports, food fairs and religious ceremonies. The festival both exposes the culture and tradition of ethnic peoples, and reinforces Nagaland’s identity as a unique state in India’s federal union. Experts have commented that A lot of older folk in the villages travel to Kohima to attend this festival and meet people from other villages from Nagaland because they haven’t met before, hence leading to cultural assimilation.
Traditional arts are also featured, with paintings, wood carvings, and sculptures by modern Naga artists on display. Naga troupes sing folk songs, perform traditional dances and play indigenous games and sports. In the evenings a programme of music concerts, catering for all tastes, ensures that the festive spirit continues through the night.

It also marks initiation of young people to adulthood and is considered an ""identity marker of the Angami"". The Christian converts among the tribals have gradually rejected these rituals.

Details
Sekrenyi is a compound word formed by Sekre meaning ""sanctification"" and Nyi meaning ""festival."" The festival calendar is linked to the agricultural cycle, which varies from village to village. Thus, the celebration is held between the months of December–March, and the duration also varies from ten to fifteen days.
The festival is generally held starting from 25 February as per the Gregorian calendar. It is celebrated by both the Krüna Angami/Pfütsana and Christian Angami. The duration is reduced to five days for the Christian villagers who had earlier converted to Christianity but belonged to the same ethnic group; they participate in the festivities but they do not follow any of the rituals connected with it.

Rituals
A number of rituals and ceremonies are involved with the festival. On the first day, which is known as Kezie, people sprinkle themselves with a few drops of rice water drawn from a pot named Zumho. The water drops are first gathered into leaves, and the chief lady of the house reverently fixes the leaves at the three main corner pillars of the house. This is followed by the men assembling at the well to bathe.
On the second day, young men of the village assemble in the village to perform ablutions. They adorn themselves with two new shawls, and then ritualistically sprinkle the holy water on their chests, knees and right arms as a mark of washing away all their sins and ill luck. When they come back from the well, a sacrificial offer of a cock is performed.
The fourth day of the festival marks the New Year of the Angamis. It begins with revelry by singing and feasting which lasts for three days. The young people, both men and unmarried girls with shaven heads gather and sing traditional songs the entire day; the songs relate to past days of valour and bravery. For the revelry 
of music and dance, the men and women of the community wear traditional dress; while men carry head hunting spades, women carry baskets.
The seventh day is devoted to hunting by the young men of the ethnic group. On the eighth day, the ritual involves pulling down of a gate (meaning replacing an old gate that demarcates the property). This is followed in the next two days by the people of villages formally exchanging visits and offering greetings. During the period of the ten day festivities, field operations are suspended; in local terminology this act is called Penyû. Following the completion of the festival period, when men of the villages have cleansed themselves and sought blessings, cultivation, house building and marriages may restart for the year.

The nine day Fall festival celebrates the end of the harvest season.,"Tokhü Emong is a harvest festival celebrated by the Lotha Nagas in the Indian state of Nagaland. The nine day Fall festival celebrates the end of the harvest season.

Etymology
In the Lotha Naga language, tokhü means feast (eating food and drinking) and emong means halt on the appointed time.

Overview
Tokhü Emong is celebrated in the first week of November every year and it lasts for nine days. This festival is associated with the harvesting of crops. It is also accompanied by folk dances and singing of folk songs. 
During Tokhü Emong, the adherents praise the gods for their blessings. Tokhü Emong is also a celebration of brotherhood, forgiveness, and oneness. It is celebrated through sharing of food, gifts, folklore narration and a community feast.
During this festival, the entire Village takes part in the celebration. Every household have food and drinks prepared for the feast. Friends, families neighbors are invited to each other's house and this continues for 9 days. The main features of the feast are community songs, dances, feast, fun and frolic. Everyone attires themselves in their beautiful traditional dresses and costumes according to their social status. There is an air of gaiety and light heartedness everywhere. Gifts of food and drinks are exchanged during the Festival. Among friends, the number of cooked meat given denotes the depth of friendship and ties. For example, if one man offers 12 pieces of meat to his friend, it shows that he treasures his friendship, it is reciprocated, and he is also offered 12 pieces of meat, it means that the friendship is valued from both sides.
In this case, should any disaster or misfortunes strikes either one of them, both of them will stand by each other no matter what. Thus a friendship of loyalty and fidelity was pledged. In case of mere acquaintances or platonic ones, only 6 pieces of meat are exchanged.
It is the Priest who gives the signal for the start of the festival. He accompanied by aides (Yinga) along with baskets goes round the village collecting un husked rice from every home when offering is made. The priest takes a handful of it, showers prayers and it is only after this that he puts the contribution in his basket. The belief was that the more generous the contribution, the more yield one would get during harvest but if any one refuses to contribute, he would lead a pauper's life. So none would dare to refuse contribution for fear of that. A portion of the collection is used to buy a pig and the rest is used for making rice-beer. The pig is killed and cut and is distributed to the contributors. The ritual is considered as contributing factor to general prosperity.
Before the commencement of the festival, if any stranger happens to be in the village, he gets two options; to leave the village (past beyond the village gate) before sunset or to stay there in the village until the festival is over. He however, enjoys the warm hospitality of the villagers. This festival also provide the occasion to offer prayers for the departed souls. The family who lost any member during the year performs his/her last rites. The people remain in the village till the last rites are performed.
Young boys and girls engaged during the year are happily married after Tokhü. It is also the time for renovating the village gate, cleaning wells and repairing houses.
Tokhü Emong is also a festival of thanks giving, sharing and reconciliation but the most beautiful aspect of this festival is that past rancours are forgiven, new ties are formed and bonds of closer intimacy are formed.
Wild cries of Joy-echo over the green hills and narrow valleys. One feels as if the stones have been given tongue to say ‘Oh farmers, tender your fields with love and care’.

Customs and rituals
Before the festival
The village priest proclaims the opening of Tokhü Emong. He travels door-to door in the village with a basket to collect edibles. For this purpose Yinga, or supporters, also accompanied him. This collection is an offering to the Limha Potsow Ha Oyak Potsow (Earth-God and Sky-God). The priest takes a small quantity of the contribution and put it into his basket after offering his prayers. It is customary for the fellow villagers to contribute liberally as it is believed that more contribution facilitated more crops during cultivation. According to legend, anyone who refuses a contribution brings a bad curse upon themselves and ends up as a beggar.
A fraction of this gathering is used to buy a pig and the rest was kept for making rice beer. Later, with the help of a bamboo spear, a perforation is made in the pig's heart, then the abdomen is sliced open to interpret the prophecy. The priest reads the destiny of the village from the entrails.. The pig is then divided into small portions and distributed amongst every household.
If a stranger arrives in the village before the festival starts, he or she can either leave or stay as a guest throughout the festival, enjoying the hospitality of the village.
The wells of the villages are cleaned and the houses are repaired as well.

During the festival
There may be a slight difference in some ritual performance and other celebrating activities in between the villages among the Lothas. The village itself had its own priest and customary laws within its village and therefore, act or perform accordingly. However, the identity of Tokhü Emong, its significance, and subjects or aims are all same.
The people wear their conventional dresses to the ceremonies
Prayers are offered to the spirits of the people who had died in the previous year. Any family who lost any member is expected to stay in the village until the last rituals are performed.  Villagers are expected to put aside bitterness and settle all problems with others. People express their gratitude for what they have and strive to create new ties of friendship. 
A meal is served to everyone, followed by folk dance, folk songs. and the exchange of gifts
After the festival, marriages are arranged for the young couples, who were engaged during the year.

Dates
Tokhü Emong is an annual festival that begins on 7 November and continues for nine days. Historically, the festival did not have a fixed start date; Lotha Naga elders settled on a fixed date in order to strengthen unity among the community. Recently, the Nagaland Government has set a date on Nagaland Government calendar as holidays for Lothas only, on 6 and 7 November.

Tokhü Emong Bird Count
Since 2022, the Nagaland Forest Department in collaboration with others organises the Tokhü Emong Bird Count aimed at promoting the state's biodiversity and encourage community conservation efforts.

Etymology
Danda has various meanings, but there are two main meanings of the word

Club, Rod, Pole, Stick, Staff, Sceptre
Punishment, Chastisement
The term Naata comes from the word Natya, which gives many different denotations of music, dance and drama. The term Jatra means theatre.

Folktale of the origin of the word danda
Lord Ganesh was being taught a dance by his father, Lord Shiva. It was a religious dance called Tandava Nritya. In the process of learning the dance, Lord Shiva kicked the stage he was on, and made a sound that sounded like the word ""Dan"". Then a piece of brass material broke off the chain Lord Shiva wore around his ankle and fell on a percussion instrument known as Mardala. The brass material hitting the Mardala made a very loud ""Da"" noise. Those two sounds were put together to form the word Danda. Danda came to be associated with dance because of that episode.

Danda Naata Ceremony
Danda Naata is an Indian dance festival that originated in the Ganjam district of Odisha. Danda Naata is a form of a religious festival that has theatrical and dance components. The dance is done mainly to worship Lord Shiva, the God of destruction of the Hindu mythology. There are other Gods and Goddesses that are worshiped by the spiritual dance also, such as Krishna Ganesh, Kali, and Durga amongst others. The low caste Hindus and the high caste, such as the Brahmins, all participated in the Danda Naata. The dance along with the accompanying events is performed over the course of three months March, April, and May. Some events are performed in March – April, the month of Chaitra, and other events are performed in April – May, the month of Vaishakha. 
People commit self- inflicted wounds to worship Lord Shiva because the philosophy of ancient Hindu says that for a person to be great, one has to have self-control over one's body (Kaya), mind (Mana), and speech (Vakya).
So in order to achieve greatness, a lot of punishments, Danda, to the individual must be undergone, so this event is known as Danda Naata.

Dance component of the religious festival
Danda Naata consists of multiple dances. People start Danda by fasting, having a single meal a day made up of rice and dal, and worshipping their Lord before the actual dances occur.
This dance consists of a series of dances which are performed one after another by the male members belonging to the Scheduled Castes and other backward castes. In this dance the Ghasis provide the music with the help of Dhol and Mahuri. The dance has a rich repertory. Parva dance is the first item of the repertory. The Prabhakar and the Prabhakariani, dressed in multi coloured dress, dance in the beginning. The dancer places a piece of cloth on his shoulders and holds the ends of the same in front with both the hands. He moves his hands forward and backward, right and left, to the rhythm of the dance. A semi-circular plate, made of bamboo sticks and covered with coloured and decorated cloth with ornamental border, is tied to the back of the Prabhkar. The Prabhakar wears multi coloured skirt and jacket. The Prabhakariani, a male in female role, dresses himself in sari and kanchala (blouse). The Prabhakariani holds apiece of coloured handkerchief in his hand. After the Parava dance is over the Hara –Parvati dance begins. Then a group dance of Fakir and Fakiriani is performed. The dances of Savara  and Savarani, Chadeya and Chadouni, are performed one after another. Then the party performs a leela based on a story from the Ramayana or the Mahabharata or from any other Puran through songs and dances . Patarasaura and Patarasaurani perform their dance at the end of the leela. The last, but not the least, is the Binakar who closes the performance with his most significant songs and dances. Then males that belong to backward and scheduled castes perform the Parava dance. In the Parava dance, the Prabhakar, male acting as a male, and the Prabhakariani, a male acting as a female, begin the dance in multi – colored clothing. A piece of cloth is placed on the shoulders of dancers. The cloth is held with both hands and the dancers move the cloth backwards and forwards and side to side according to the rhythm of the dance. Then immediately following that dance the Hara – Parvati is performed.
After those dances are performed, a host of other dances are performed. The Fakir and Fakiriani, a group dance, is performed first. Then the Savara and Savarani are performed with the Chadeya and Chadouni dances being performed directly after. Then everyone gets involved in the festivities by performing a leela through songs and dances, which is based on a story from various Purans. After the leela, the Patarasaura and Patarasaurani perform their  traditional dance. Lastly, the Binakar ends the events through dances and songs.

The roles of the dancers
The various dances of the Danda Naata have various themes behind them. Each of the roles in the dances sing a different tune. Some songs are based on historical stories, while others have a more comical approach. Some groups use a question/answer approach. The groups that use that approach have one role, male or female role, ask questions, while the other role give answers to those replies. Although the songs can be performed through multiple approaches, all the songs have the same style, folk and Odissi.

Music
The music of the Danda Naata is different for different dances . The songs are of different tunes for different characters. The songs are mainly devotional and mostly based on stories from the epics. Humorous songs are sometimes sung by the dancers . sometimes they put questions in songs and their counterpart give the reply in songs. The songs are of folk and Odissi style. The dance originated from tribal dances, but has been much influenced by the Yatra and Pala performance of the state. Danda Naata is being gradually modernized in respect of music, dance, costume, style  and make up. It is thereby losing its original simplicity and traditional characteristics.

Marking the arrival of spring, this festival is observed on the full moon day (Purnima) in the Hindu month of Falgun (February–March). Dedicated to god Krishna and Radha, Dola Purnima is a unique blend of devotion, tradition, and cultural exuberance, deeply rooted in Odisha's heritage.

Etymology and Historical Significance
The term ""Dola"" (ଦୋଳ in Odia) means ""swing,"" and ""Purnima"" (ପୂର୍ଣିମା) refers to the full moon. Thus, Dola Purnima literally translates to the ""Swing Festival on the Full Moon."" The festival is deeply embedded in Odia culture and is mentioned in ancient Odia texts and scriptures. The swinging of deities, especially Krishna, symbolizes the joy and playfulness of divine love. The festival is also associated with the agricultural cycle, marking the end of winter and the beginning of spring, a time of renewal and abundance.
In Odia tradition, the festival is closely linked to the worship of Jagannath, who is revered as Dola Govinda during this time. The festival reflects the deep spiritual connection between the people of Odish and their deities, celebrating the divine presence in everyday life.

The Divine Legend
Dola Purnima is deeply connected to the legend of Prahlad and Holika, which symbolizes the victory of good over evil. According to Hindu mythology, Prahlad, a devotee of Vishnu, was saved from his evil aunt Holika's attempt to burn him alive. This story is celebrated during Dola Purnima and the subsequent Holika Dahan, reinforcing the festival's themes of faith, renewal, and the triumph of righteousness.

Rituals and Celebrations
Village Processions
The festival begins with the ceremonial procession of deities through villages. Idols of Krishna and Radha, adorned with flowers and ornaments, are carried on elaborately decorated palanquins called Veemanas. These processions are accompanied by traditional music, devotional songs, and the rhythmic beats of drums and cymbals. Villagers welcome the deities into their homes, offering bhog (ritual food offerings) and seeking blessings.

Swing Ceremony
The highlight of Dola Purnima is the Dola Melana, a grand gathering of deities from various villages at a central location called Melana Padia. Here, the idols are placed on beautifully decorated swings, known as dola, which are gently rocked to the rhythm of devotional songs. This swing ceremony, central to the festival, is believed to bring blessings and spiritual purification to devotees.

Celebrations at Jagannath Temple, Puri
Dola Purnima holds special significance at the iconic Jagannath Temple in Puri. On this day, the temple opens early to allow devotees to witness the deities adorned in the magnificent Raja Dhiraj Besa or  Suna Besa, featuring exquisite gold jewelry. Jagannath, worshipped as Dola Govinda, is ceremonially placed on the dola bedi (swing platform), where devotees apply colors to the deities, creating a joyous and divine atmosphere.

Cultural Significance
Dola Purnima is not just a religious festival but also a cultural milestone in Odisha. It marks the beginning of the new Odia calendar year, with traditional almanacs (panjis) being read out to village deities. The festival also celebrates the arrival of spring, symbolizing renewal and the rejuvenation of nature. Unlike the liquid colors used in other regions, Odisha's Dola Purnima is characterized by the use of Abira (ଅବିର), a violet-colored powder, giving the festival a distinct identity.

Contemporary Celebrations
In modern times, Dola Purnima has evolved to include community feasts, cultural programs, and eco-friendly celebrations. Urban areas host vibrant events showcasing Odisha's rich heritage of music, dance, and art, while rural celebrations retain their traditional charm.

Names
In West Bengal, Odisha, Assam, Jharkhand and Tripura, Durga Puja is also called Akalbodhan (literally, ""untimely awakening of Durga""), Sharadiya pujo or puja (""autumnal worship""), Sharodotsab (""festival of autumn""), Maha pujo (""grand puja""), Maayer pujo (""worship of the Mother""), Durga pujo, or merely Puja(In Odisha, Bihar) or Pujo. In Bangladesh, Durga Puja has historically been celebrated as Bhagabati puja. Maa Durga is known as the Goddess of Power (feminine) which represents triumph of Goodness over evil.
Durga Puja is also referred to by the names of related Shakta Hindu festivals such as Navaratri, celebrated on the same days elsewhere in India; such as in Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Kerala, and Maharashtra, Kullu Dussehra, celebrated in Kullu Valley, Himachal Pradesh; Mysore Dussehra celebrated in Mysore, Karnataka; Bommai Golu, celebrated in Tamil Nadu; Bommala Koluvu, celebrated in Andhra Pradesh; and Bathukamma, celebrated in Telangana.

History and origins
Durga is an ancient goddess of Hinduism according to available archeological and textual evidence. However, the origins of Durga Puja are unclear and undocumented.

The name Durga, and related terms, appear in Vedic literature, such as in the Rigveda hymns 4.28, 5.34, 8.27, 8.47, 8.93 and 10.127, and in sections 10.1 and 12.4 of the Atharvaveda A deity named Durgi appears in section 10.1.7 of the Taittiriya Aranyaka. While the Vedic literature uses the word Durga, the description therein lacks legendary details about her or about Durga Puja that is found in later Hindu literature.
A key text associated with Durga Puja is Devi Mahatmya, which is recited during the festival. Durga was likely well established by the time this Hindu text was composed, the date of which scholars estimate as between 400 and 600 CE. The Devi Mahatmya scripture describes the nature of evil forces symbolised by Mahishasura as shape-shifting, deceptive, and adapting in nature, in form and in strategy to create difficulties and thus achieve their evil ends. Durga calmly understands and counters the evil in order to achieve her solemn goals.Durga, in her various forms, appears as an independent deity in the Indian texts.
In the Mahabharata, both Yudhisthira and Arjuna invoke hymns to Durga. She appears in Harivamsa in the form of Vishnu's eulogy and in Pradyumna's prayer. The prominent mention of Durga in such epics may have led to her worship.

Some versions of the Puranas mention Durga Puja to be a spring festival, while the Devi-Bhagavata Purana and two other Shakta Puranas mentions it to be an autumn festival. The Ramayana manuscripts are also inconsistent. Versions of Ramayana found in the north, west, and south of the Indian subcontinent describe Rama to be remembering Surya (the Hindu sun god) before his battle against Ravana, but the Bengali manuscripts of Ramayana, such as the Krittivasi Ramayana, a 15th-century manuscript by Krttivasa, mention Rama to be worshipping Durga. As per the legend, Rama worshipped Durga in the autumn to have her blessings before defeating Ravana. While he was preparing for the worship of the goddess, Durga hid one of the 108 flowers of lotus, very essential for her worship. Having found only 107 of 108 lotuses at the time of the worship, Rama decided to offer one of his eyes in place of that lotus. When he was about to offer his eye, Durga appeared and told him that she had only hidden the flower in order to test his devotion and she was satisfied with it. She blessed Rama and he continued with her worship. Since the gods are believed to be sleeping during autumn, the awakening rite of the Durga puja is also known as akāla bodhana.
Surviving manuscripts from the 14th-century provide guidelines for Durga Puja, while historical records suggest the royalty and wealthy families to be sponsoring major Durga Puja public festivities, since at least the 16th-century. The 11th or 12th-century Jain text Yasatilaka by Somadeva mentions an annual festival dedicated to a warrior goddess, celebrated by the king and his armed forces, and the description mirrors attributes of Durga Puja.
According to some scholars, the worship of the fierce warrior goddess Durga, and her darker and more violent manifestation Kali, became popular in the Bengal region during and after the medieval era, marked by Muslim invasions and conquests.
The significance of Durga and other goddesses in Hindu culture is stated to have increased after Islamic armies conquered regions of the Indian subcontinent. According to yet other scholars, the marginalization of Bengali Hindus during the medieval era led to a reassertion of Hindu identity and an emphasis on Durga Puja as a social festival, publicly celebrating the warrior goddess.From the medieval era up to present-day, Durga Puja has been celebrated as a socio-cultural event, while maintaining the roots of religious worship.

Rituals and practices
Texts
The puja rituals involve mantras (words manifesting spiritual transformation), shlokas (holy verses), chants and arati, and offerings. The worship begins with a reading of the Sanskrit Devī Mahātmya from the sixth-century Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa. The shlokas and mantras praise the divinity of the goddess; according to the shlokas, Durga is omnipresent as the embodiment of power, nourishment, memory, forbearance, faith, forgiveness, intellect, wealth, emotions, desires, beauty, satisfaction, righteousness, fulfillment and peace.

Relation to harvest
Durga Puja is, in part, a post-monsoon harvest festival observed on the same days in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism as those in its other traditions. The practice of including a bundle of nine different plants, called navapatrika, as a symbolism of Durga, is a testament practice to its agricultural importance. The typically selected plants include not only representative important crops, but also non-crops. This probably signifies the Hindu belief that the goddess is ""not merely the power inherent in the growth of crops but the power inherent in all vegetation"".
The festival is a social and public event in the eastern and northeastern states of India, where it dominates religious and socio-cultural life, with temporary pandals built at community squares, roadside shrines, and temples. The festival is also observed by some Shakta Hindus as a private home-based festival.
Before Durga puja there is Paata Puja, the ritual of making an idol on the day of the Rath Yatra, usually around July. 'Paata' is the wooden frame that forms the base for the idols.

Day One
Durga Puja is a ten-day event. The festival begins with Mahalaya, a day on which Hindus perform tarpaṇa by offering water and food to their dead ancestors. The day also marks the arrival of Durga from her marital home in Kailash.
The festival starts at twilight with prayers to Saraswati. She is believed to be another aspect of goddess Durga. This is also the day when the eyes are painted of the deities on the representative clay sculpture-idols, bringing them to a lifelike appearance. The day also marks prayers to Ganesha and visit to pandals and temples.

Day Two to Five
Day two to five mark the remembrance of the goddess and her manifestations, such as Kumari (goddess of fertility), Mai (mother), Ajima (grandmother), Lakshmi (goddess of wealth) and in some regions as the Saptamatrikas (seven mothers) or Navadurga (nine aspects of Durga). On the sixth day major festivities and social celebrations start. The first nine days overlap with Navaratri festivities in other traditions of Hinduism.The specific practices vary by region.

Day Six to Nine
The next significant day of the festival is the sixth day (Shashthi), on which devotees welcomes the goddess and festive celebrations are inaugurated. Rituals typically performed on the sixth day include:
Bodhana: Involves rites to awaken and welcome the goddess to be a guest. The amorphous sight of the goddess is consecrated into a ghata or noggin while the visible sight is consecrated into the murti or idol. These rituals are known as ghatasthapana and  pranapratistha respectively.
Adhivasa: Anointing ritual wherein symbolic offerings are made to Durga, with each item representing a remembrance of subtle forms of her.
On the seventh day (Saptami), eighth (Ashtami) and ninth (Navami) days, the goddess along with Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha, and Kartikeya are revered and these days mark the main days of worship with recitation of scriptures, puja, legends of Durga in Devi Mahatmya, social visits to elaborately decorated and illuminated pandals (temporary structures meant for hosting the puja), among others.

Navapatrika snan: Bathing of the navapatrika with holy water done on the seventh day of the festival.
Sandhi puja and Ashtami pushpanjali: The eighth day begins with elaborate pushpanjali rituals. The cusp of the ending of the eighth day and beginning of the ninth day is considered to be the moment when per scriptures Durga engaged in a fierce battle against Mahishasura and was attacked by the demons Chanda and Munda. Goddess Chamunda emerged from the third eye of Durga and killed Chanda and Munda at the cusp of Ashtami and Navami, the eighth and ninth days respectively. This moment is marked by the sandhi puja, involving the offering of 108 lotuses and lighting of 108 lamps. It is a forty-eight minutes long ritual commemorating the climax of battle. The rituals are performed in the last 24 minutes of Ashtami and the first 24 minutes of Navami. In some regions, devotees sacrifice an animal such as a buffalo or goat, but in many regions, there is not an actual animal sacrifice and a symbolic sacrifice substitutes it. The surrogate effigy is smeared in red vermilion to symbolize the blood spilled. The goddess is then offered food (bhog). Some places also engage in devotional service.

Homa and bhog: The ninth day of festival is marked with the homa (fire oblation) rituals and bhog. Some places also perform kumari puja on this day.

Day Ten
Sindoor khela and immersion: The tenth and last day, called Vijaya Dashami is marked by sindoor khela, where women smear sindoor or vermillion on the sculpture-idols and also smear each other with it. This ritual signifies the wishing of a blissful marital life for married women. Historically the ritual has been restricted to married women. The tenth day is the day when Durga emerged victorious against Mahishasura and it ends with a procession where the clay sculpture-idols are ceremoniously taken to a river or coast for immersion rites. Following the immersion, Durga is believed to return to her mythological marital home of Kailasa to Shiva and the cosmos in general. People distribute sweets and gifts, visit their friends and family members on the tenth day. Some communities such as those near Varanasi mark the day after Vijaya Dashami, called Ekadashi, by visiting a Durga temple.

Dhunuchi naach and dhuno pora: Dhunuchi naach involves a dance ritual performed with dhunuchi (incense burner). Drummers called dhakis, carrying large leather-strung Dhaks, Dhols and other traditional drums depending on the region, to create music, to which people dance either during or not during aarati. Some places, especially home pujas, also observe dhuno pora, a ritual involving married women carrying dhunuchis burning with incense and dried coconuts, on a cloth on their head and hands,

Decorations, sculptures, and stages
The process of the creation of clay sculpture-idols (pratima or murti) for the puja, from the collection of clay to the ornamentation is a ceremonial process. Though the festival is observed post-monsoon harvest, the artisans begin making the sculpture-idols months before, during summer. The process begins with prayers to Ganesha and to the perceived divinity in materials such as bamboo frames in which the sculpture-idols are cast.

Clay, or alluvial soil, collected from different regions form the base. This choice is a tradition wherein Durga, perceived as the creative energy and material, is believed to be present everywhere and in everything in the universe. In certain traditions in Kolkata, a custom is to include soil samples in the clay mixture for Durga from areas believed to be nishiddho pallis (forbidden territories; territories inhabited by the ""social outcasts"" such as brothels).
The clay base is combined with straw, kneaded, and then molded into a cast made from hay and bamboo. This is layered to a fine final shape, cleaned, painted, and polished. A layer of a fiber called jute, mixed in with clay, is also attached to the top to prevent the statue from cracking in the months ahead. The heads of the statues are more complex and are usually made separately. The limbs of the statues are mostly shaped from bundles of straws. Then, starting about August, the local artisans hand-paint the sculpture-idols which are later dressed in clothing, are decorated and bejewelled, and displayed at the puja altars.
The procedure for and proportions of the sculpture-idols are described in arts-related Sanskrit texts of Hinduism, such as the Vishvakarma Sashtra.

Environmental impact
The sculpture-idols for the puja are traditionally made of biodegradable materials such as straw, clay, soil, and wood. In today's times, brighter colored statues have increased in popularity and have diversified the use of non-biodegradable, cheaper or more colorful substitute synthetic raw materials. Environmental activists have raised concerns about the paint used to produce the statue, stating that the heavy metals in these paints pollute rivers when the statues are immersed at the end of the Durga festival.
Brighter colors that are also biodegradable and eco-friendly, as well as the traditional natural colors, are typically more expensive compared to the non biodegradable paints. The Indian state of West Bengal has banned the use of hazardous paints, and various state government have started distributing lead-free paints to artisans at no cost to prevent pollution.

Animal sacrifice, symbolic sacrifice
Shakta Hindu communities mark the slaying of Mahishasura and the victory of Durga with a symbolic or actual sacrifice. Most communities prefer symbolic sacrifice, where a statue of the asura is made of flour or equivalent, is immolated and smeared with vermilion, symbolic of the blood that had spilled during the battle. Other substitutes include a vegetable or a sweet dish considered equivalent to the animal. In certain instances, devotees consider animal sacrifice distasteful, and practice alternate means of expressing devotion while respecting the views of others in their tradition.
In communities performing actual sacrifice, an animal is sacrificed, mainly at temples. In Nepal, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam, animal sacrifices are performed at Shakta temples to commemorate the legend of Durga slaying Mahishasura. This involves slaying of a fowl, pig, goat, or male water-buffalo. Large scale animal sacrifices are rare among Hindus outside the regions of Bengal, Odisha, Assam, and Nepal. In these regions, festivals are primarily when significant animal sacrifices are  observed.
The Rajputs of Rajasthan worship their weapons and horses in the related festival of Navaratri, and some historically observed the sacrifice of a goat, a practice that continues in some places. The sacrifice ritual, supervised he the priest, requires slaying of the animal with a single stroke. In the past this ritual was considered a rite of passage into manhood and readiness as a warrior. The Kuldevi (clan deity) among these Rajput communities is a warrior goddess, with local legends tracing reverence for her during Rajput-Muslim wars.

Pandals and theme-based pujas
Months before the start of Durga Puja, youth members of the community collect funds and donations, engage priests and artisans, buy votive materials and help build pandals centered around a theme, which has rose to prominence in recent years. Such themes have included sex work, celebration of humanity, marginalization of queer persons and transgender persons, folk culture, celebration of cinema, womanhood,  pro-environment themes, while others have chosen metaphorical themes such as celebration of maati (literally, soil or ash) and ""finding one's own light"". Pandals have also been replicated on existing temples, structures, and monuments and yet others have been made of elements such as metal scraps, nails, and turmeric among others. Durga Puja pandals have also been centered around themes to acknowledge political events such as the 2019 Balakot airstrike and to protest against the National Register of Citizens of India.
The budget required for such theme-based pujas is significantly higher than traditional pujas. For such theme-based pujas, the preparations and the building of pandals are a significant arts-related economic activity, often attracting major sponsors. Such commercialized pujas attract crowds of visitors. The growth of competitiveness in theme-based pandals has escalated costs and scale of Durga Puja in eastern states of India. Some segments of the society criticize the billboards, the economic competition, and seek return to basics. The competition takes many forms, such as the height of statue. In 2015, an 88-foot statue of Durga in Kolkata's Deshapriya Park attracted numerous devotees, with some estimates placing visitors at one million.

Regional celebrations and observances
There exists variation in Durga Puja worship practices and rituals, as is the case with other Hindu festivals, in the Indian subcontinent. Hinduism accepts flexibility and leaves the set of practices to the choice of the individuals concerned. Different localized rituals may be observed regionally, with these variations accepted across temples, pandals, and within families.
The festival is most commonly associated with Bengali Hindus, and with the community having variability and differences in practices. There may exist differences of practice between the puja of theme-based Pandals, family pujas (with puja of erstwhile aristocrat families known as bonedi puja), and community pujas (known as barowari pujas) of neighbourhoods or apartments.
The rituals of the puja also varies from being Vedic, Puranic, or Tantric, or a combination of these. The Bengali Durga Puja rituals typically combine all three. The non-Bengali Durga Puja rituals tend to be essentially Vedic (srauta) in nature but they too incorporate esoteric elements making the puja an example of a culmination of Vedic-Tantric practices.
Historical evidence suggests that the Durga Puja has evolved over time, becoming more elaborate, social, and creative. The festival had earlier been a domestic puja, a form of practice that still remains popular. But it had also come to be celebrated in the sarvajanin (public) form, where communities get together, pool their resources and efforts to set up pandals and illuminations, and celebrate the event as a ""mega-show to share"". The origins of this variation are unclear, with some sources suggesting a family in Kolkata reviving such celebration in 1411 CE. While other set of sources suggest that a Bengali landlord, named Kamsanarayan, held a mega-show puja in late 16th-century Bengal. Yet, this festival of Bengal is likely much older with the discovery of 11th and 12th-century Durga Puja manual manuscripts such as Durgotsavaviveka, Durgotsava Prayoga, Vasantaviveka and Kalaviveka. The rituals associated with the Durga Puja migrated to other regions from Bengal, such as in Varanasi, a city that has historically attracted sponsorship from Hindus from various parts of the Indian subcontinent including Bengal. In contemporary India, Durga Puja is celebrated in various styles and forms.
In Kolkata, Durga Puja is an annual festival celebrated magnificently. Kolkata alone hosted more than 3,000 Barowari pujas in Kolkata in 2022, with more than 200 pujas were organized in the city with a budget of over one crore rupees. Kolkata has been inscribed on the list of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists in December 2021.
In Bishnupur, West Bengal, Durga Puja holds a unique and significant place. The district boasts the Rajbari Durga Puja, also known as the Mrinmoyee Maa er pujo, which dates back to 994 AD. This makes it the oldest Durga Puja in the entire Bengal region, encompassing present-day Bangladesh, Odisha, and Tripura.
In Basirhat, West Bengal, the scale and intensity of durga puja celebration is among the biggest in North 24 Parganas district with more than 100 installations in the city. For more than 150 years, the Durga idol has been immersed on boats in this city. On the day of Vijayadashami, people usually come in Basirhat to see the immersion festival. The idols and installations have changed in the modern era, but the immersion continues to be done in the Ichamati River by boat according to the ancient tradition. A fair is held on both banks of the river centering on the immersion. The special attraction of this fair is wooden furniture and various wooden items.

Durga Puja is a widely celebrated festival in the Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh (eastern parts), Assam, and Odisha. It is celebrated over a five-day period. Streets are decked up with festive lights, loudspeakers play festive songs as well as recitation of hymns and chants by priests, and pandals are erected by communities. The roads become overcrowded with revellers, devotees, and pandal-hoppers visiting the pandals on puja days. It often creates chaotic traffic conditions. Shops, eateries, and restaurants stay open all night; fairs are also set up and cultural programmes are held. People form organizing committees, which plan and oversee the pandal during the festivities. Today, Durga Puja has turned into a consumerist social carnival, a major public spectacle and a major arts event riding on the wave of commercialisation, corporate sponsorship, and craze for award-winning. For private domestic pujas, families dedicate an area of their homes, known as thakur dalan, for Durga Puja where the sculpture-idols for worship is placed and decorated with home-dyed fabric, sola ornamentations, and gold and silver foil decorations. Elaborate rituals like arati are performed and prasad is distributed after being offered to the deities. As a tradition, married daughters visit their parents and celebrate the Durga Puja with them, a symbolism alluding to Durga who is popularly believed to return to her natal home during the puja.

Durga Puja is also a gift-giving and shopping season for communities celebrating it, with people buying gifts for not only family members but also for close relatives and friends. New clothes are the traditional gift, and people wear them to go out together during Durga Puja. During puja holidays, people may also go to places of tourist attractions while others return home to spend Durga Puja with their family. It's a common trend amongst youngsters and even those who are older to go pandal-hopping and enjoy the celebrations.
The organising committees of each puja pandal hires a purohita (priest) who performs the puja rituals on behalf of the community. For the priests, Durga Puja is a time of activity wherein he pursues the timely completion of Vedic-Puranic-Tantric ritual sequences to make various offerings and perform fire oblations, in full public view, while the socio-cultural festivities occur in parallel. The complex puja rituals include periods of accurate and melodic scripture recitation. The puja involves crowds of people visiting the pandals, with smaller groups visiting family pujas, to witness the celebrations. On the last day, the sculpture-idols are carried out in immersion processions across Bengal, following which they are ritually immersed into rivers or other waterbodies. The immersion ceremony continues till a couple of days after the last day of puja.

According to some scholars, the ritual of immersing the Durga sculpture-idol into the river attracted the attention of colonial era travelers to the Bengal region from Europe, such as Garcin de Tassy and Emma Roberts. In 1831, Tassy reported that similar rituals were annually observed by the Muslim community in Bengal. Shia Bengali Muslims observed Muharram over ten days, taking out processions in memory of the martyrdom of Imam Husayn ibn Ali, and then cast a memorial Imam's cenotaph into a river on the tenth day. Tassy further stated that the Bengali rituals of Muharram included the same offerings at the annual observation of Muharram that the Hindu rituals included during Durga Puja. According to yet other scholars, the ritual of immersion in water by Hindus for Durga Puja in Bengal and Ganesh Chaturthi in the western states of India, may have grown because members of the Hindu community attempted to create a competing procession and immersion ritual to that of Muharram, allowed by the colonial British Indian government in the 19th and early 20th-centuries.

In Maharashtra, the city of Nashik and other places such as CIDCO, Rajeevnagar, Panchavati, and Mahatmanagar host Durga Puja celebrations. While in Delhi, the first community Durga Puja was organized near Kashmiri Gate by a group of expatriate Bengalis, in 1910, a year before Delhi was declared the capital of British India. This group came to be the Delhi Durga Puja Samiti, popularly known as the Kashmere Gate Durga Puja. The Durga Puja at Timarpur, Delhi was started in the year 1914. In 2011, over 800 Durga Pujas were held in Delhi, with a few hundred more in Gurgaon and NOIDA.

In Odisha, Durga Puja is the most important festival of the people of the state. Durga Puja is a very important festival for Odias, during the 4 days of the festival, the streets of the city turns into a wonderland throughout the state, people welcome the arrival of their maa by rejoicing themselves, eating tasty food, wearing new clothes, seeing different pandals across the city, family gathering and gift givings. In 2019, ninety-seven pandals in Cuttack alone, Odisha were reported to bedeck respective sculpture-idols with silver jewelry for Durga Puja celebrations; such club of pandals termed regionally as Chandi Medha. The state capital is famous for the modern themes and creativity In the pandals, while the Western part of the state has a more retro decoration theme to the pandal. In the northern parts of the state particularly Balasore, Durga Puja is celebrated with much fervor and the Odia diaspora abroad especially in Australia, which originates 95% from the district of Balasore celebrates the puja in the same manner which is done back home in Balasore. In September 2019, 160 pandals were reported to be hosting Durga Puja in Cuttack.
While in Tripura there were over 2,500 community Durga Puja celebrations in 2013. Durga Puja has been started at the Durgabari temple, in Agartala by King Radha Kishore Manikya Bahadur.

Beyond being an art festival and a socio-religious event, Durga Puja has also been a political event with regional and national political parties having sponsored Durga Puja celebrations. In 2019, West Bengal Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee announced a grant of ₹25,000 to all community-organised Durga Pujas in the state.
In 2019, Kolkata's Durga Puja was nominated by the Indian government for the 2020 UNESCO Representative list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Durga Puja also stands to be politically and economically significant. The committees organising Durga Puja in Kolkata have close links to politicians. Politicians patronize the festival by making donations or helping raise money for funding of community pujas, or by marking their presence at puja events and inaugurations. The grant of ₹25,000 to puja organizing committees in West Bengal by a debt-ridden state government was reported to cost a budget a ₹70 crores. The state government also announced an additional grant of ₹5,000 to puja organizing committees fully managed by women alone, while also announcing a twenty-five percent concession on total electricity bills for puja pandal. The government had made a grant of ₹10,000 each to more than 20,000 puja organizing committees in the state in 2018.
A 2013 report by ASSOCHAM states West Bengal's Durga Puja to be a ₹25,000 crores worth economy, expected to grow at the compound annual growth rate of about 35 per-cent. Economic slowdowns in India, such as in 2019, have hence affected corporate sponsorships and puja budgets for public celebrations. In August 2019, the Income Tax Department of India had allegedly sent notices to various Durga Puja organizing committees in West Bengal, against which the ruling party of the state, All India Trinamool Congress (AITMC) protested. The Central Board of Direct Taxes denied sending any such notices, to which AITMC politician Madan Mitra is reported to have said that the intention may have been to enquire if tax deducted at source had been deducted on payments to vendors for organizing community pujas.

Economic significance
Durga Puja directly affects the economy. In 2022, the economy of West Bengal was estimated to get a boost of 50,000 crore rupees. The annual GDP of West Bengal was expected to be expanded by 20-30 percent that year. The factors responsible for this economic boost are mainly the increase of earning in transport, tourism, industry, business, shopping and other fields. The Kolkata Metro Railway recorded an earning of ₹6 crore in just five days of Durga Puja in 2022.
The famous puja pandals get sponsorship from renowned companies and labels. Usually, the dress and jewelries of the idols, the material used to make the typically very elaborate pandals, decorations, lightings are sponsored.

Social significance
Durga Puja plays a great significance in the living of certain peoples. The kumors, those who make the idols with clay and also makes other clayey products, earns lakhs of rupees by selling a single set of Durga idol of average size. Hence, it makes their annual income because idols used in other festivals are a lot more cheaper. Other professions that receive the majority of their annual income are dhaaki (plays dhaak), priest and other small homecrafts. It is assumed that these profession based small classes would become smaller in population if Durga Puja was absent.

Media attention
The day of Mahalaya is marked by the Indian Hindu community of West Bengal with Mahishasuramardini — a two-hours long All India Radio program — that has been popular in the Bengali community since the 1950s. While in earlier days it used to be recorded live, a pre-recorded version has come to be broadcast in recent decades. Bengalis traditionally wake up at four in the morning on Mahalaya to listen to the radio show, primarily involving recitations of chants and hymns from Devi Mahatmyam (or Chandi Path) by Birendra Krishna Bhadra and Pankaj Kumar Mullick. The show also features various devotional melodies.
Dramas enacting the legend of Durga slaying Mahishasura are telecasted on the television. Radio and television channels also air other festive shows, while Bengali and Odia magazines publish special editions for the puja known as Pujabarshiki (Annual Puja Edition) or Sharadiya Sankhya (Autumnal Volume). These contain works of writers, both established and upcoming, and are more voluminous than the regular issues. Some notable examples of such magazines in Bengali are Anandamela, Shuktara, Desh, Sananda, Nabakallol, and Bartaman.

Celebrations outside India
Durga Puja is celebrated commonly by both Bangladesh's Bengali and non-Bengali Hindu community. Some Bengali Muslims also take part in the festivities. In Dhaka, the Dhakeshwari Temple puja attracts visitors and devotees. In Nepal, the festivities are celebrated as Dashain.

Legends
The legend of Jagaddhatri is inspired from a tale in the Kena Upanishad. In the Katyayani Tantra, the following legend is told. After the goddess Durga killed Mahishasura, the gods of Svarga forgot about her powers. So, in order to test them, Parvati appeared before the gods Agni, Vayu, Varuna, and Chandra, who considered themselves invincible and were engulfed by ahamkara (ego). She asked them to move a tiny blade of grass. Vayu failed to pluck it; Agni failed to burn it. Every god failed at the task. In the end, they understood that the Goddess is the source of all power in the universe; even theirs. The goddess appeared before them as Uma, riding on a lion. The goddess is equated with Brahman in the narrative. The goddess gave the ego of the gods the form of an elephant. Jagaddhatri is depicted sitting on a lion with an elephant under them. The elephant, symbolizing ahamkara, lies under the paws of her vahana the lion, who symbolises courage, valour and the strength to overcome any challenges, including one's internal struggles with the Shada Ripus (""the six enemies"").
Her dhyana mantra describes her weapons, vahana and her iconography. She is sitting atop a lion, wearing different jewelry, in her four hands Devi holds bow, arrow, chakra and Samkha. She is reddish like the rising sun and she is wearing a snake garland. Her reddish colour and weapons are the symbols of raja guna but this is not for destruction and going to war. Rather this is to keep the world focused on Ritam & Satyam.
In her stotram (Jagadhatri Strotram), she has been invoked as Adhara bhutah, Dhritirupah, Dhurandharah, Dhruvapadah, Shaktistah, Shaktirupah, Shaktacharpriyah, Shaktivigrahe. ""You must believe in the Ishwara rupa. Do you know the meaning of Jagadhatri rupa? She is carrying the world. If she stops then the world will get destroyed"" is said by Sri Ramakrishna.
She sustains the universe through her Yoga shakti. Naga/Sarpa is the symbol of Yoga & Upavitam is the symbol of Bramhin. Devi is yogini. She is using the world through her maha yoga shakti. The act of rescuing the world is her lila. It is said that she had killed the elephant demon, Kurandrasura. Its mention is not found in her dhyana mantra but in her idol an elephant is seen below her mount lion, who is none other than Kurandrasura.

History of worship
There are variations regarding the history of worship of the goddess in Bengal. The popular narrative states that the worship was begun by Maharaja Krishnachandra of Krishnanagar, Nadia. However, as per local history, the worship of goddess Jagatdhatri was first established  by Chandrachur Tarkamani of Santipur who made an idol of the goddess at the behest of Raja Girishchandra. At the time only ghat puja was conducted at Krishnanagar, Nadia in Bengal. Idol worship of the goddess was initiated in the village of Bramhasason, which is located in Haripur in Santipur, Nadia. Furthermore, the Jaleshwara temple of Shantipur (1665) and Raghaveshwara Temple (1669) have the idol of the goddess inside the sanctum sanctorum as well as carved on the temple walls. So, her worship may have been known in Nadia long before Krishna Chandra.
At Krishnanagar, Raj Rajeshwary Jagatdhatri Puja is one of the oldest in Bengal. As per local history, Maharaja Krishnachandra was arrested by Nawab Siraj-ud-Dullah once for not paying taxes on time. He was released from prison during the day of Vijaya Dashami. Having missed  the entire festivity of Durga Puja in his kingdom, Maharaja became extremely sad. Seeing her devotee sad, the ultimate mother, Goddess Jagaddhatri gave Maharaja a vision and the king commenced the ritual of Jagatdhatri Puja in his native place. The puja was performed by Raj Rajeshwary (Raj Mata in Bengali language) and before the start, a Jagatdhatri Puja was donated by Maharaja Krishna Chandra named Maa Jaleshwary at ""Malopara Barowary"". The worship of the goddess was later resumed by Sarada Devi, wife of Ramakrishna.
The Jagatdhatri puja of Bose family and Chatterjee family, Palpara and Bhavanipur, deserves a special mention in this regard. The puja of Bose family initially used to be held in their ancestral home in Murshidabad. Folklore has it that this puja was started in 1788. The puja was later shifted to its present location in Chandannagar, where many of the family members now live. The exact history of the deity is unknown, but family records date it back to 1640. In Chatterjee family this puja originates from 1700 in Srirampur which later was shifted to Chatterjee's official ancestral home in 1936 by Hari Mohan Chatterjee. For over 40 years it remained the centre of attraction during the festivities. After the demise of Hari Mohan Chatterjee the puja was continued by 3 generations by Shashanka Chatterjee, Nilanka Chatterjee (Son of Late Shashanka Chatterjee) and at present by Tirthanka Chatterjee and Ankita Chatterjee (children of Nilanka and Jayeeta Chatterjee). In 2023 the puja got shifted again for the 2nd time in 200 years to Bangalore, marking a historic shift to South of India. The Puja is continued by Chatterjees with all grandeur and tradition dating back centuries.

Researcher Mohit Roy has noted that Jagadhatri vigraha from Barisal is from the 8th Century. Currently, the vigraha is in the Ashutosh Museum (Kolkata). One must note that such Simha-Vahini vigrahas have been discovered plenty, particularly from western Bengal.
The first textual mention of Jagadhatri puja comes from Kalviveka of Smarta Shulapani, dated approximately from 1375 to 1460. Later Smartas ""Brihaspati Raymukut"" and ""Srinatha Acharya Churamani"" have mentioned the goddess in their work.
The time in which she is worshipped, Shukla Paksha of the pious month of Kartika, especially the Tithi of Navami, is very auspicious. In ancient times, it was known as Chandika Puja. According to Smritisagara and Mahamohopadhhaya Panchanan Tarkaratna, it is the day to worship Uma.
The oldest temple of the goddess is in Somra (Hooghly), also known as Mahavidya temple. It was established in 1621 CE. The worship of the goddess takes place in the Dekhuria village as well in Birbhum. Still older is the Jagadhatri puja of Baligram village (Jiaganj, Murshidabad), dated back to five hundred years ago. Bandyopadhyay family of Mirhat of Kalna are observing Jagadhatri puja for more than four hundred years. Jagadhatri puja is the main Puja of Dhatrigram, Baidyapur & Mirhat of Kalna. The 350-year-old Chandrapati family's kuladevi is Jagrata.

Festivities
Jagatdhatri Puja is very popular in Krishnanagar, Chandannagar, Tehatta, Rishra, Howrah, Bhadreswar, (Sutragarh-Santipur), Boinchi and Ashoknagar-Kalyangarh.
The beauty of the festival in Chandannagar is mainly due to the collaborative conception between the French and Bengalis. Remarkable feature remaining its procession, second largest in the world after Rio de Janeiro's, with its magnificent lightings.
The Jagadhatri puja of Krishnanagar is a visual and spiritual celebration to see. During this time the city adorns itself with lots of lights, flowers, pandals and the likes. Each year more than 5 lakh devotees come to Krishnanagar to be a part of this grandiose festival. There are about 150-175 clubs and barowaris which organise Jagadhatri puja in the city. The Jagadhatri puja of Krishnagar is a perfect blending of devotion, emotion and celebration. The most popular Jagadhatri puja is the ""Burima"" of ""Chasa Para"", which was started in 1772. This deity is called the Tirupathi of Krishnanagar. Each year the idol is embellished with 150 kg gold and 150 kg silver ornaments with more than 10 benarasis and jamdanis. Besides ""Buri Maa"", ""Choto Maa"" (the deity of Kathalpota Barowari), ""Mejo Maa"" (the deity of College Street Barowari) and ""Jaleswari"" (the idol of Malo para Barowari) are also very famous.

Jagadhatri Mela
After Ratha Yatra, Jagadhatri Mela at Bhanjpur Jagadhatri Podia, is the biggest mela of Baripada, Odisha. It is the festival of Maa Jagadhatri, Goddess of the whole world. There is an 8–15 day mela (carnival) also known as mini Bali Jatra named after Cuttack's Bali Jatra which takes place at Jagadhatri Mela Podia, Bhanjpur, near the Bhanjpur railway Station during the month of October–November. It is celebrated on Gosthastami. It is also referred to as another Durga Puja as it also starts on Asthami tithi and ends on Dashami tithi. The date of the puja is decided by the luni-solar Hindu calendar.
In 2012, the ""Sarbajanin Maa Jagadhatri Puja"" has been started from 21 November. But the mela continued from 26 November to 7 December (for the first time it was for such a long period of 13 days). As the puja was celebrating its Diamond Jubilee for completing 60 years.
In 2013, the ""Sarbajanin Maa Jagadhatri Puja"" was started on 11 November. But to commemorate the loss of Odisha, specifically Mayurbhanj district and Baripada due to Phailin and post Phailin flood, the Cultural Program and it's live telecast on Blue Sky was cancelled. Still. the ""mela"" was held from 14 to 25 November 2013.

Every year its main attraction is the Puja Torana (Pandal) and the Mela. The Pandal is decorated as a famous monument in 2011 it was a miniature of US Capitol Building, United States. This year, it is Lalitha Mahal, Mysore. From the year 2000 it has been a tradition to decorate the torana as a special infrastructure. Tajmahal in Agra, Victoria Memorial in  Kolkata, the Titanic, Lotus Temple in New Delhi, Golden Temple in Punjab and many other monuments were also mimicked in the previous years since 2000 to 2006. As a tribute to 26/11 Hotel Taj Mahal Palace & Tower, Mumbai attack victims, the torana of the year 2009 is a lookalike of that hotel.

In literature
Goddess Jagatdhatri has been mentioned in many novels by Bengali authors, poets and novelists. Goddess Jagatdhatri figures in the historical fiction Anandamath written by Bengali novelist Bankim Chandra Chatterjee. It is the same literary work from which the national song of India Vande Mataram originates. In the novel, Kali, Durga, and Jagatdhatri are depicted as three aspects of 'Bharat Mata' (Mother India) – Jagatdhatri as the mother used to be, Kali as the mother now is, and Durga as the mother will be in future. The trio of goddesses are shown as the object of worship of a group of ascetics who form the protagonists of the story.

The festival is especially popular in the region of West Bengal, and other places like Mithila,  
Jharkhand, Odisha, Assam, and Tripura, as well as the town of Titwala in Maharashtra, along with the neighbouring country of Bangladesh.","Kali Puja (ISO: Kālī Pūjā), also known as Shyama Puja or Mahanisha Puja, is a festival originating from the Indian subcontinent, dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kali. It is celebrated on the new moon day (Dipannita Amavasya) of the Hindu calendar month of Ashwayuja (according to the amanta tradition) or Kartika (according to the purnimanta tradition). The festival is especially popular in the region of West Bengal, and other places like Mithila,  
Jharkhand, Odisha, Assam, and Tripura, as well as the town of Titwala in Maharashtra, along with the neighbouring country of Bangladesh.

History
The festival of Kali Puja is not an ancient one. Kali Puja was practically unknown before the 16th century; famous sage Krishnananda Agamavagisha first initiated Kali Puja. A late 17th-century devotional text, Kalika mangalkavya, also mentions an annual festival dedicated to Kali. In Bengal during the 18th century, King (Raja) Krishnachandra of Nadia also made this puja wide spread. Kali Puja saw a surge in popularity in the 19th century, coinciding with the rise in prominence of the Kali devotee Sri Ramakrishna among Bengalis. This period marked a significant shift, as affluent landowners began to sponsor the festival extensively, leading to grander and more elaborate celebrations. Along with Durga Puja, Kali Puja is the biggest festival in Tamluk, Barasat, Barrackpore, Naihati, Sonamukhi (Bankura), Dhupguri, Dinhata,
Tapshitala. It is also famous in Bhagalpur of Bihar.

Worship
During Kali Puja (like Durga Puja) worshippers honor the goddess Kali in their homes in the form of clay sculptures and in pandals (temporary shrines or open pavilions). She is worshipped at night with tantric rites and mantras. She is prescribed offerings of red hibiscus flowers, sweets, rice, and lentils. It is prescribed that a worshipper should meditate throughout the night until dawn. Homes and pandals may also practice rites in the Brahmanical (mainstream Hindu-style, non-Tantric) tradition with ritual dressing of Kali in her form as Adya Shakti Kali and no animals are sacrificed. She is offered food and sweets made of rice, lentils, and fruits. 
However, in Tantric tradition, animals are ritually sacrificed on Kali Puja day and offered to the goddess. A celebration of Kali Puja in Kolkata is held in a large cremation ground (Kali is believed to dwell in cremation grounds). Barasat, Tamluk, Barrackpore, Naihati and Madhyamgram region of North 24 Parganas, In North Bengal: Dhupguri, Dinhata, Coochbehar is well known for their majestic pandals, lightings and Idols. Durga Puja of Kolkata is often said synonymously with Kali Puja of Barasat. The region experiences Lacs of footfalls during the days of the festival. People from different regions gather to witness the majestic pandals.
The pandals also house images of Kali's consort, Shiva, two famous Bengali Kali devotees named Ramakrishna and Bamakhepa, along with scenes from mythology of Kali and her various forms, including images of the Mahavidyas, sometimes considered as the ""ten Kalis."" The Mahavidyas is a group of ten Tantric goddesses headed by Kali. People visit these pandals throughout the night. Kali Puja is also the time for magic shows, theater, and fireworks. Recent custom has incorporated wine consumption.
In the Kalighat Temple in Kolkata, Kali is worshipped as Lakshmi on this day. The temple is visited by thousands of devotees who give offerings to the goddess. Another famous temple dedicated to Kali in Kolkata is Dakshineswar Kali Temple, where Sri Rāmakrishna performed rites.

Other celebrations
Although the widely popular annual Kali Puja celebration, also known as the Dipanwita Kali Puja, is celebrated on the new moon day of the month of Kartika, Kali is also worshipped in other new moon days too. Three other major Kali Puja observations are Ratanti Kali Puja, Phalaharini Kali Puja and Kaushiki Amavasya Kali Puja. Kaushiki amavasya Kali Puja is greatly associated with the goddess Tara of Tarapith as it is considered the day when Devi Tara appeared on earth and blessed sadhak Bamakhepa, also according to the legends on this day the doors of both the ""Naraka"" and the ""swarga"" open for some time, while Ratanti puja is celebrated on Magha Krishna Chaturdashi and Phalaharini puja is celebrated on Jyeshta Amavashya of Bengali calendar. The Phalaharini Kali Puja is especially important in the life of the saint Ramakrishna and his wife Sarada Devi, since on this day in 1872, Ramakrishna worshipped Sarada Devi as the goddess Shodashi. In many Bengali and Assamese households, Kali is worshipped daily.

History
This festival is rooted in Hindu mythology of Goddess Lakshmi as narrated in the Lakshmi Purana. According to the text, Goddess Lakshmi once visited Shriya, a low-caste scavenger woman, which angered Balarama, the elder brother of Lord Jagannath. As a result, Lakshmi was expelled from the Jagannath Temple, one of the four most sacred pilgrimage sites (Char Dham) for Hindus. In response, Lakshmi left the temple and cursed her husband and brother-in-law to endure severe hardships without food, water, or shelter. The Lakshmi Purana challenges the social evil of Untouchability and highlights the themes of feminism and female empowerment, portraying Lakshmi as a powerful force against male dominance. Inspired by this story, devotees perform puja for Goddess Lakshmi, celebrating her strength and advocating for social equality.

This is the most important social festival of Western Odisha and Chhattishgarh also  adjoining areas of Simdega in Jharkhand, where the culture of Western Odisha is much predominant.

About the festival
Nuakhai is also called Nuakhai Parab or Nuakhai Bhetghat. It is also known as Navakhai Parv in Chhattisgarh. The word nua means new and khai means food, so the name means the farmers are in possession of the newly harvested rice. The festival is seen as a new ray of hope, held the day after the Ganesh Chaturthi festival. It has a big significance for farmers and the agricultural community. The festival celebrated at a particular time of day which is called lagan. Aersaa Pithaa is prepared to celebrate this festival. When the lagan comes, the people first remember their village god or goddess and then have their khai.
Nuakhai is the agricultural festival of people of Western odisha. The festival is observed throughout Odisha, but it is particularly important in the life and culture of Western Odisha. It is a festival for the worship of food grain. It has its best celebration in the Kalahandi, Sambalpur, Balangir, Bargarh, Sundergarh, Jharsuguda, Subarnapur, Boudh and Nuapada districts of Odisha.

Ancient origin
According to local researchers Nuakhai is of fairly ancient origin. Some researchers found the fundamental idea of the celebration can be traced back at least to Vedic times when the rishis (sages) had talked of panchayajna, the five important activities in the annual calendar of an agrarian society. These five activities have been specified as sitayajna (the tilling of the land), pravapana yajna (the sowing of seeds), pralambana yajna (the initial cutting of crops), khala yajna (the harvesting of grains) and prayayana yajna (the preservation of the produce). In view of this, Nuakhai may be seen as having evolved out of the third activity, namely pralambana yajna, which involves cutting the first crop and reverently offering it to the mother goddess.

Origin of the current form
Although the origin of the festival has been lost over time, oral tradition dates its back to the 14th century AD, the time of the first Chauhan King Ramai Deva, founder of the Patna State which is currently part of Balangir district in Western Odisha. In his efforts to build an independent kingdom, Raja Ramai Deo realized the significance of settled agriculture because the subsistence economy of the people in the area was primarily based on hunting and food gathering. He realised this form of economy could not generate the surpluses required to maintain and sustain a state. During state formation in the Sambalpuri region, Nuakhai as a ritual festival played a major role in promoting agriculture as a way of life. Thus credit can be given to Raja Ramai Deo for making Nuakhai a symbol of Sambalpuri culture and heritage.

Journey from past to present
In the early years, there was no fixed day for celebration of the festival. It was held sometime during Bhadraba Sukla Pakhya (the bright fortnight of Bhadraba). It was the time when the newly grown Kharif crop (autumn crop) of rice started ripening. There are reasons for observing the festival in the month of Bhadrava even though the food grain is not ready for harvesting. The thought is to present the grain to the presiding deity before any bird or animal pecks at it and before it is ready for eating.
In early traditions, farmers would celebrate Nuakhai on a day designated by the village headman and priest. Afterward, under the patronage of royal families, this simple festival was altered into a mass socio-religious event celebrated in the entire Kosal region (western Odisha region)

Deities that are offered Nua
Every year, the tithi (day) and samaya (time) of observance was astrologically determined by the Hindu priests.  Priests sat together at the Brahmapura Jagannath temple in Sambalpur and calculated the day and time. The tithi (date) and lagna (auspicious moment) were calculated in the name of Pataneswari Devi in the Balangir-Patnagarh area, in the name of Sureswari Devi in the Subarnapur area, and in the name of Manikeswari Devi in the Kalahandi area. In Sundargarh, Puja (worship) was first offered by the royal family to the goddess Sekharbasini in the temple which is opened only for Nuakhai. In Sambalpur, at the stipulated lagna (auspicious moment), the head priest of Samaleswari Temple offers the nua-anna or nabanna to the goddess Samaleswari, the presiding deity of Sambalpur.

Rituals of the nine colors of Nuakhai
People in the Western Odisha region initiate preparations for the event 15 days in advance. Nuakhai is understood to have nine steps, and as a consequence, nine Step of rituals are followed as a prelude to the actual day of celebration. These nine Step include:

Beheren (announcement of a meeting to set the date)
Lagna dekha (setting the exact date for partaking of new rice)
Daka haka (invitation)
Sapha sutura and lipa puchha (cleanliness)
Ghina bika (purchasing)
Nua dhan khuja (looking for the new crop)
Bali paka (final resolve for Nuakhai by taking the Prasad (the offering) to the deity)
Nuakhai (eating the new crop as Prasad after offering it to the deity, followed by dancing and singing)
Juhar bhet (respect to elders & gift transfers)

Details of the rituals of Nuakhai
The preparations begin some 15 days prior to the date of the festival, when the elderly persons of the village sit together at a holy place after the beheren calls the villagers by blowing a trumpet. Then people get together and discuss with the priests the tithi and lagna (auspicious day and time) for Nuakhai. The priest consults the panjika (astrological almanac) and announces the sacred muhurta (a period of time equal to about 48 minutes) when nua is to be taken.
There was an attempt made during the 1960s to set a common tithi for the Nuakhai festival all over the western Odisha . It was decided this was not a workable idea. The idea was reintroduced in 1991 to set the Bhadraba Sukla Panchami tithi for the Nuakhai festival. This became successful and since then, the festival has been celebrated on that day, and the Odisha State Government has declared it an official holiday. Although for the sake of convenience a common auspicious day is set for Nuakhai, the sanctity of the ritual has not lost its importance. Today, however, the system of setting the tithi and lagna and calling elderly persons for a consensus does not happen in urban areas.
Nuakhai is celebrated both at the community and domestic level. The rituals are first observed at the temple of the reigning deity of the area or to the village deity. Afterward, the people worship in their respective homes and offer rituals to their domestic deity and to Lakshmi, the deity of wealth in the Hindu tradition. People wear new clothes for the occasion. It is a tradition that after offering the nua to the presiding deity, the eldest member of the family distributes nua to other members of the family. After taking the nua, all the junior members of the family offer their regards to their elders. Thereafter follows the nuakhai juhar, which is the exchange of greetings with friends, well-wishers, and relatives. This symbolizes unity. This is an occasion for people to lay their differences to rest and start relationships afresh. Towards the evening people meet one another, exchanging greetings. All differences are discarded and elders are wished nuakhai juhar. The elders bless their juniors and wish them long life, happiness, and prosperity. Even the partitioned brothers celebrate the festival under one roof. In the evening, folk dances and songs are organized called ""Nuakhai Bhetghat"". People dance to the foot tapping traditional Sambalpuri dance forms like Rasarkeli, Dalkhai, Maelajada, Chutkuchuta, Sajani, Nachnia, and Bajnia.

Other Indian tribes celebrating Nuakhai
According to Singh, evidence can be found of the Nuakhai festival been observed by nearly all the major tribes in central and eastern India, with a minor difference in nomenclature. Jeth Nawakhai is celebrated among the Dudh Kharia and Pahari Kharia, Nawakhani amongst the Oraon and Birjia, Jom Nawa among the Munda and Birjia, Janther or Baihar-Horo Nawai by the Santal, Gondli Nawakhani by the tribal people of Ranchi district, Nawa by the Birjia, Nawa-Jom by the Birhor, Dhan Nawakhani by Korwa, and so on. Russel and Hiralal  have mentioned the Nawakhani festival of the Paraja, a small tribe found in the Bastar region and Odisha . Gautam (1977) observed a new corn offering and rice eating festival of the Santals in Santal Pargana which they term Jom Nawa. Das Gupta (1978) has noted the Nawa ceremony of the Birjia, a section of the Asura tribe of Chhotanagpur. Bhaduri (1944:149-50) presents a short note on the celebration of a festival of the Tripura known as Mikatal where Mi stands for rice and Katal means new. It is celebrated in the month of Aswina (September–October).In the coastal districts of Odisha, the festival is called Nabanna. Regardless of the name, the main objective of this festival is to get social sanction for the new crop, and to invoke the deities to bless the land with abundant crops.

Nuakhai celebrated throughout India
Nuakhai is a cohesive and unified force between people of the Western Odisha living in Delhi, as they unite and celebrate together the occasion of Nuakhai. People from the Odisha now living in Rajasthan Bangalore, Bhopal, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, Surat and Visakhapatnam have been celebrating Nuakhai in their new cities for the past few decades. The modern Nuakhai festival, now being observed on the fifth day of the second fortnight of Bhadrava, was unquestionably given a new look of homogeneity and uniformity by various social organizations of Western Odisha, including the government of Odisha in 1991. It has lost some of its enormity and variety with the passage of time, but Nuakhai is still an occasion which endorses the patrimonial nature of the Sambalpuri culture and society.

The festival occurs in the solar Odia calendar (the lunisolar Hindu calendar followed in Odisha) on the first day of the traditional solar month of Meṣa, hence equivalent lunar month Baisakha. This falls on the Purnimanta system of the Indian Hindu calendar. It therefore falls on 13/14 April every year on the Gregorian calendar.
The festival is celebrated with visits to Shiva, Shakti or Hanuman temples. People take baths in rivers or major pilgrimage centers. Communities participate in mela (fairs), participate in traditional dance or acrobatic performances.

Pana Sankranti is related to new year festivals in South and Southeast Asian solar New Year as observed by Hindus and Buddhists elsewhere such as Vaisakhi (north and central India, Nepal), Bohag Bihu (Assam), Pohela Boishakh (Bengal), Puthandu (Tamil Nadu) etc.

Practices
In the Odia Hindu tradition, Pana Sankranti is believed to be the birthday of the Hindu deity Hanuman, whose loving devotion to Rama (the seventh incarnation of Vishnu) in the Ramayana is legendary. His temples, along with those of Shiva and Surya (the Sun god) are revered on the new year.
Hindus also visit Devi (goddess) temples on Pana Sankranti. The temples include Taratarini Temple near Brahmapur, Odisha in Ganjam, Cuttack Chandi, Biraja Temple, Samaleswari temple and Sarala Temple. At Sarala Temple the priests walk on hot coals in the fire-walking festival, Jhaamu Yatra. At the Maa Patana Mangala Temple in Chhatrapada, Bhadrak, the Patua Yatra festival is held from 14 April to 21 April. In Northern Odisha, the festival is known as Chadak Parva. In Southern Odisha, the Meru Yatra festival is celebrated as the end of the month-long danda nata dance festival. Thousands of devotees gather at the Shakti Pitha shrine in the Taratarini Temple because it is one of the auspicious days during the Chaitra Yatra.
The significance of the day is that the new Odia calendar or Panjika is also introduced which is an almanac of Hindu festivals and contains the dates of festivals, auspicious days and timings, timings of sunrise and sunset along with horoscopes for the year.

Bela Pana
People from all over the state eat festive Chhatua and drink Bela Pana to mark the occasion. The Bela Pana is prepared with Bael, chhena, grated coconut and fruits, spices like ginger and black pepper and sugar or jaggery.

Basundhara theki
An important ritual observed during Pana Sankranti is Basundhara theki. A water filled earthen pot with a small hole at the end is placed at the top of the holy basil plant, so that water keeps dripping on the plant.

Local celebrations
Ghantapatuas are traditional male folk artistes from the Odisha that perform the art form ""Jhama nata"" during Pana Sankranti. They generally perform in a group of two or four wearing dresses that resemble women's clothing.

Danda nata that is performed during this festival celebration is one of the most ancient forms of performance art of the region. The opening ritual begins in the middle of Chaitra (March – April). The performers, also known as Dandua, take dip in a village pond and walk/run over hot charcoals while performing the art. After performing danda nata they also perform jala danda by dipping themselves in deep water for a short while. These performances symbolize the liberation from physical pain. A notable climax of the social celebrations is fire-walk, where volunteers sprint over a bed of burning coal while being cheered with music and songs.

Related holidays
This new year day is celebrated elsewhere across South and Southeast Asia which follow the related Hindu-Buddhist solar calendar traditions of South and Southeast Asian solar New Year (Mesha Sankranti and Songkran). It is known Vaisakhi  across North India and Nepal and marks the beginning of the Hindu Solar New Year. The same day every year is also the new year for many Buddhist communities in parts of southeast Asia such as Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Cambodia, likely an influence of their shared culture in the 1st millennium CE. Some examples include:

Vaisakhi in North India and Nepal
Pohela Boishakh in states of West Bengal and Bangladesh
Bohag Bihu in Assam
Jur Sital in Mithila
Puthandu in Tamil Nadu
Vishu in Kerala
Aluth Avuruthu in Sri Lanka
Songkran in Thailand
Chol Chnam Thmey in Cambodia
Pi Mai Lao in Laos
Thingyan in Burma
However, this is not the universal new year for all Hindus. For many others who follow the Lunar calendar, the new year falls on Chaitra Navaratri, Ugadi, Gudi Padwa etc, which falls a few weeks earlier. For some, such as those in and near Gujarat, the new year festivities coincide during the five day Diwali festival.

Year Wise Date and Day of Puspuni
2018 - 02 Jan 2018, Tuesday

Special deviation
Bargarh town, in Western Odisha deviates from the normal observation by delaying 1 day, as the mythical King of Dhanuyatra, death of Maharaj Kansa, on the same day as per Indian Lunar Calendar. The day is delayed due to death of the King Kansa on the largest open air theatre.

Feasting and merrymaking
The farmers of Western Odisha grow paddy on their agricultural land during monsoon and harvest in autumn. After they bring home all the yield, they find relaxed of all the toils and experience a great sense of satisfaction. This inspires them to rejoice with family and friends. On the full moon day of the month of Pausha they cook rice, tasty dishes (Chha' Tun Na' Bhajaa), especially goat meat, along with rice pudding and cakes. The family dines together and makes marry. They share their dishes and cakes with other families and friends. Some communities celebrate with Kusna (rice-liquor) and MahuliThis feasting is associated with community playing, singing and dancing. In past, the male youth played Chhur, Gudu, and Gourbaadi. Some engage themselves in pastimes like Kukraamaar (cock-fight), Garraamaar (ram-fight) and the like. Likewise, the girls played Saatgaati or Kansaadiindoors and Humo-bauli outdoors.

Chher-Chheraa
Apart from the great feasting and merrymaking, there is also one more great event that is observed on this Puspuni. This is known as Chher-Chheraa. The word is derived from two Sambalpuri words, Chere and Charaa. Chere-Charaa means ""grains for the birds"" – a small part of your produce for the unattended lives upon this earth!  
On this day the little boys and girls move round the village from door to door and collect Chher-Chheraa, a handful of grains from every household. With this they prepare food and feast away from home. Dance and music is an integral part of children's Chher-Chheraa. Chher Chheraa is also given away to the poor families who do not own agricultural land and or depend upon the farmers. Thus, Chher-Chheraa symbolises a concern for the non-producing members of the society.

Bhuti and Nistaar
On this day of Puspuni, the farmer gives away the remuneration to all labourers of all the agricultural operations. This remuneration is called Bhuti. So also, the farmer gives away some annual bonus to them. This bonus is called Nistaar. With this Nistaar the annual contract of labour ends for the previous agricultural year. As lexical meaning of the word nistaar is ""freedom"", for an agricultural labourer, Puspuni means the independence day and hence, celebration.

The second day of the festival signifies beginning of the solar month of Mithuna, from which the season of rains starts.

Mythology
It is believed that the Hindu earth goddess, Bhumi, one of the consorts of the deity Vishnu, experiences menstruation during the first three days of the festival. The fourth day is called Vasumati Snana, or the ceremonial bath of Bhumi. The term Raja came from the Sanskrit word rajas, which means menstruation, and a menstruating woman is called rajasvala. In the medieval period, the festival became more popular as an agricultural holiday marking the worship of Bhumi, who is venerated as the consort of Jagannath, a regional form of Vishnu. A silver murti of Bhumi is present in the Puri Temple beside Jagannath.

Rajaparba
It falls in mid June, the first day is called Pahili Raja,
second day is Mithuna Sankranti, third day is Bhudaaha or Basi Raja.
The final fourth day is called Basumati snana,
in which the ladies bath the grinding stone as a symbol of Bhumi with turmeric paste and adore with flower, sindoor etc. All type of seasonal fruits are offered to mother Bhumi.
The day before first day is called Sajabaja or preparatory day during which the house, kitchen including grinding stones are cleaned, spices are ground for three days. During these three days women and girls take rest from work and wear new Saree, Alata, and ornaments. It is similar to Ambubachi Mela.
The most popular among numerous festivals in Odisha, Raja is celebrated for three consecutive days. Just as the earth prepares itself to quench its thirst by the incoming rain the unmarried girls of the family are groomed for impending matrimony through this festival. They pass these three days in joyous festivity and observe customs like eating only uncooked and nourishing food especially Podapitha, do not take bath or take salt, do not walk barefoot and vow to give birth to healthy children in future. The most vivid and enjoyable memories one has of the Raja gaiety is the rope-swings on big banyan trees and the lyrical folk-songs that one listens from the nubile beauty enjoying the atmosphere.
To celebrate the advent of monsoon, the joyous festival is arranged for five days by the villagers. Though celebrated all over the state it is more enthusiastically observed in all over the Odisha but celebrated with much fervour across the coastal districts. The first day is called ""saja baja"" second day is called ""Pahili Raja"", third is ""Raja Sankranti"" and fourth is ""Bhumi Dahana or Basi Raja"". And fifth is Basumati snana
According to popular belief as women menstruate, which is a sign of fertility, so also Mother Earth menstruates. So all three days of the festival are considered to be the menstruating period of Mother Earth. During the festival all agricultural operations remain suspended. As a mark of respect towards the Earth during her menstruation days, all agricultural works comes to a standstill during these days. Significantly, it is a festival of the unmarried girls, the potential mothers. They all observe the restrictions prescribed for a menstruating woman. The very first day, they rise before dawn, do their hair, anoint their bodies with turmeric paste and oil and then take the purificatory bath in a river or tank. Peculiarly, bathing for the rest two days is prohibited. They don't walk bare-foot do not scratch the earth, do not grind, do not tear anything apart, do not cut and do not cook. During all the three consecutive days, they are seen in the best of dresses and decorations, eating cakes and rich food at the houses of friends and relatives, spending long cheery hours, moving up and down on improvised swings, rending the village sky with their merry impromptu songs.
The swings are of different varieties, such as 'Ram Doli', 'Charki Doli', 'Pata Doli', 'Dandi Doli' etc. Songs specially meant for the festival speak of love, affection, respect, social behaviour and everything of social order that comes to the minds of the singers. Through anonymous and composed extempore, much of these songs, through sheer beauty of diction and sentiment, has earned permanence and has gone to make the very substratum of Odisha's folk-poetry. While girls thus scatter beauty, grace and music all around, moving up and down on the swings during the festival, young men give themselves to strenuous games and good food, on the eve of the onset of the monsoons, which will not give them even a minute's respite for practically four months making them one with mud, slush and relentless showers, their spirits keep high with only the hopes of a good harvest. As all agricultural activities remain suspended and a joyous atmosphere pervades, the young men of the village keep themselves busy in various types of country games, the most favourite being 'Kabadi'. Competitions are also held between different groups of villages. All nights 'Jatra' performances or 'Gotipua' dances are arranged in prosperous villages where they can afford the professional groups. Enthusiastic amateurs also arrange plays and other kinds of entertainment.

The women in the family view Surya through the bowl of turmeric water and offer all the dishes to Surya. They read the legend of Samba Dasami Brata Katha and pray for the well-being of all family members.

There they are ceremonially bathed and decorated for a public audience with the devotees.

Religious significance
It is a belief among devotees of Lord Jagannath that if they make a pilgrimage to see the deity on this day, they would be cleansed of all of their sins. Hundreds of thousands of devotees visit the temple on the occasion. The Skanda Purana mentions that King Indradyumna arranged this ceremony for the first time when the idols of the deities were first installed.

Ceremonies conducted
On the eve of the Snana Yatra (which means the Divine Bathing festival, in Sanskrit), the idols of the deities are brought out in a grand procession from the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) to the Snana Bedi (bathing platform). Devotees come to view the deities.
On the day of the Snana Yatra, the deities are bathed with 108 pots, of ritually purified water drawn from the northern well of the temple to the accompaniment of religious incantations.
In the evening, at the conclusion of the bathing ritual, Jagannath and Balabhadra are dressed up in elephant headgear representing the God Ganesh. This form of the God is called the 'Gajavesha'.
After the Snana Yatra the Gods are traditionally believed to fall ill and are kept in a sick room to recuperate in privacy under the care of the Raj Vaidya. During this period known as Anasara the Gods cannot be seen by devotees. At this time three pata chitra paintings are displayed for devotees to view instead
It is said that with the Ayurvedic medication ('pnachan') administered by the Raj Vaidya the Gods recover in a fortnight and resume giving an audience to their devotees.
During the Anasara period devotees head to the Alarnatha Mandira in Bramhagiri in the belief that Jagannath manifests as Alarnatha during this period

The Vasant Utsava (festival) on Panchami is celebrated forty days before spring, because any season's transition period is 40 days, and after that, the season comes into full bloom.

Nomenclature and date
Vasant Panchami is celebrated every year on the fifth day of the bright half of the Hindu lunisolar calendar month of Magha, which typically falls in late January or February. Spring is known as the ""King of all Seasons"", so the festival commences forty days in advance. It is generally winter-like in northern India, and more spring-like in central and western parts of India on Vasant Panchami, which gives credence to the idea that spring is actually in full bloom 40 days after the Vasant Panchami day.
The festival is particularly observed by Hindus in the Indian subcontinent, notably India and Nepal.  In southern states, the same day is called Sri Panchami.
On the island of Bali and the Hindus of Indonesia, it is known as ""Hari Raya Saraswati"" (great day of Saraswati). It also marks the beginning of the 210-day long Balinese Pawukon calendar.

Hinduism
Saraswati Puja
Vasant Panchami is a festival of Hindus that marks the beginning of preparations for the spring season. It is celebrated by people in various ways depending on the region. Vasant Panchami also marks the start of preparation for Holika or Holi, which occur forty days later. For many, Vasant Panchami is the festival dedicated to goddess Saraswati who is their goddess of knowledge, language, music, and all arts. She symbolizes creative energy and power in all its forms, including longing and love. The season and festival also celebrate the agricultural fields' ripening with yellow flowers of mustard crop, which Hindus associate with Saraswati's favorite color. People dress in yellow saris or shirts or accessories, share yellow-colored snacks and sweets. Some add saffron to their rice and then eat yellow cooked rice as a part of an elaborate feast.
Many families mark this day by sitting with babies and young children, encouraging their children to write their first words with their fingers, and some study or create music together. The day before Vasant Panchami, Saraswati's temples are filled with food so that she can join the celebrants in the traditional feasting the following morning. In temples and educational institutions, statues of Saraswati are dressed in yellow and worshiped. Many educational institutions arrange special prayers or pujas in the morning to seek the blessing of the goddess. Poetic and musical gatherings are held in some communities in reverence for Saraswati.
In Eastern India, primarily in the states of West Bengal, Assam, Tripura and Bihar, as well as in Nepal, people visit Saraswati temples and also worship Goddess Saraswati at home (Saraswati Puja). In West Bengal, it's one of the major festivals for Bengali Hindus and observed by many households; most schools arrange Saraswati puja for their students on their premises. In Bangladesh too, all major educational institutes and universities observe it with a holiday and a special puja.
In the state of Odisha, the festival is celebrated as Basanta Panchami/Sri Panchami /Saraswati Puja. Homas and Yagnas are done in schools and colleges across the state. Students celebrate Saraswati puja with great sincerity and fervor. Usually, children four and five years old start learning on this day in a unique ceremony named 'Khadi-Chuan' or 'Vidya-Arambha'. This is alternatively known as ""Haate-Khori"" among Bengali Hindus.
In southern states such as Andhra Pradesh, the same day is called Sri Panchami where ""Sri"" refers to her as another aspect of the one goddess Devi.

Other deities
Another legend behind Vasant Panchami is based on the Hindu god of love called Kama. Pradyumna is Kamadeva reborn as Krishna's son. Thus Vasant Panchami is also known as ""Madana Panchami"". Pradyumna is the son of Rukmini and Krishna. He awakens the passions of the earth (and its people) and thus the world blooms anew.
It is remembered as the day when the Seers (Rishis) approached Kama to wake up Shiva from his Yogic meditation. They support Parvati who is doing a penance to get Shiva as husband and seek Kama's help to bring Shiva back from his meditation to worldly desires. Kama agrees and shoots arrows, made of flowers and bees, at Shiva from his heavenly bow of sugarcane in order to arouse him to pay attention to Parvati. Lord Shiva awakens from his meditation. When his third eye opens, a fireball is directed to Kama. Kama the Lord of desires is burnt to ashes. This initiative is celebrated by Hindus as Vasant Panchami.
Vasant Panchami is associated with the emotions of love and emotional anticipation in Kutch (Gujarat) and is celebrated by preparing bouquets and garlands of flowers set with mango leaves, as a gift. People dress in saffron, pink, or yellow and visit each other. Songs about Krishna's pranks with Radha, considered to mirror Kama-Rati, are sung. This is symbolized with the Hindu deity Kama with his wife Rati.
Traditionally, in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh, after bathing in the morning, people worship Shiva and Parvati. Offerings of mango flowers and the ears of wheat are traditionally made.

Deo temple: Sun God
The shrine of the Sun God in Aurangabad district, Bihar known as the Deo-Sun Shrine, was established on Basant Panchami. The day is celebrated to commemorate the founding of the shrine by King Aila of Allahabad and the birthday of the Sun-Deo God. The statues are washed and old red clothes on them are replaced with new ones on Basant Panchami. Devotees sing, dance and play musical instruments.

Other
People celebrate the day by wearing yellow (white), eating sweet dishes and displaying yellow flowers in homes. In Rajasthan, it is customary for people to wear jasmine garlands. In Maharashtra, newly married couples visit a temple and offer prayers on the first Basant Panchami after the wedding. wearing yellow dresses. In the Punjab region, Hindus wear yellow turban or headdress. In Uttarakhand, in addition to Saraswati Puja, people worship Shiva, Parvati as the mother earth and the crops or agriculture. People eat yellow rice and wear yellow. It is also a significant school supplies shopping and related gift-giving season.
In the Punjab region, Basant is celebrated as a seasonal festival by all faiths and is known as the Basant Festival of Kites. Children buy dor (thread) and guddi or patang (kites) for the sport. The people of the Punjab wear yellow clothes and eat yellow rice to emulate the yellow mustard (sarson) flower fields, or play by flying kites. According to Desai (2010), the tradition of flying kites on various festivals is also found in northern and western Indian states: Hindus in Rajasthan and especially in Gujarat associate kite flying with the period prior to Uttarayan; in Mathura (Uttar Pradesh), kites are flown on Dussehra; in Bengal kite flying takes place on Viskwakarma Puja in September. The sport is also found in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and parts of south India.
On Bali and among Indonesian Hindus, Hari Raya Saraswati (the festival's local name) is celebrated with prayers in family compounds, educational institutions, and public venues from morning to noon. Teachers and students wear brightly coloured clothes instead of their usual uniforms, and children bring traditional cakes and fruit to school for offerings in a temple.

Sikhism
Namdhari Sikhs have historically celebrated Basant Panchami to mark the beginning of spring. Other Sikhs treat it as a spring festival, and joyfully celebrate it by wearing yellow colored clothes, emulating the bright yellow mustard flowers in the fields.
Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the founder of the Sikh Empire, encouraged the celebration of Basant Panchami as a social event in the Gurdwaras. In 1825 CE he gave 2,000 rupees to the Harmandir Sahib Gurdwara in Amritsar to distribute food. He held an annual Basant fair and sponsored kite flying as a regular feature of the fairs. Maharaja Ranjit Singh and his queen Moran would dress in yellow and fly kites on Basant Panchami. Maharaja Ranjit Singh would also hold a darbar or court in Lahore on Basant Panchami which lasted ten days when soldiers would dress in yellow and show their military prowess.
In the Malwa region, the festival of Basant Panchami is celebrated with wearing of yellow dress and kite flying. In Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur, a Basant Panchami fair is held. People attend the fair wearing yellow clothes, turbans or accessories. Sikhs also remember the martyrdom of the child Haqiqat Rai on Basant Panchmi, who was arrested by the Muslim ruler Khan Zakariya Khan after being falsely accused of insulting Islam. Rai was given the choice of converting to Islam or death and, having refused conversion, was executed on the Basant Panchami of 1741 in Lahore, Pakistan.
Nihangs go to Patiala on Basant Panchami and dress in pink and yellow on the month of Vaisakh (not only Basant Panchami day).

Pakistan
Kite flying in Lahore goes back centuries. After creation of Pakistan it evolved into a highly competitive sport which is not limited to ""basant"" only. There are regional teams, competitions, and trophies. Kite And string making is an industry all over central Punjab providing livelihood to thousands.
Given the shared history and culture in the Indian subcontinent, the Punjabi Muslims in and around Lahore also celebrate kite flying as a sport in Pakistan from home rooftops during the Basant season. In 2003, the Supreme Court of Pakistan attempted to ban the manufacture, trade, and flying of kites in Lahore on the basis of fatal incidents involving 'glass-coated' stray strings originally used in kite-battles in Lahore. In 2005 Lahore announced that Vasant Panchami could be celebrated in a forest outside of Lahore. In 2017 the ban on Vasant Panchami was briefly lifted and reimposed.

Sufi Muslim Basant
According to Lochan Singh Buxi, Basant Panchmi is a Hindu festival adopted by some Indian Muslim Sufis in the 12th century to mark the grave of the Muslim Sufi saint dargah of Nizamuddin Aulia in Delhi and ever since, has been observed by the Chishti order. According to local Sufi traditions, the poet Amir Khusrau saw Hindu women carry yellow flowers to a temple on Basant and they were dressed in yellow, and he adopted their culture to give some happiness to Nizamuddin Aulia because his nephew died few days ago and he was not recovering from grief, one the Chishti order of Sufi Indian Muslims continue to practice.

Controversy
Vasant Panchami has been a historic occasion of dispute at the archaeological site of Bhojshala (Dhar, Madhya Pradesh) with evidence of an early Saraswati temple (locally called Waghdevi). On the site of Bhojshala is a later era Kamal-Maula mosque, which Muslims use for Friday prayers. The Archeological Survey of India (ASI) has provided annual guidelines, when the Vasant Panchami festival falls on a Friday, announcing hours when Hindus can worship at Bhojshala on Vasant Panchami, and when Muslims can. However, in past years, the Muslim community scheduled earlier has refused to vacate the premises, leading to riots and disorder such as in the 1980s and 1990s.

The Siege of Anandpur Sahib and the Betrayal of 1704
In 1704, Guru Gobind Singh and his Sikhs were under immense pressure as the Mughals and hill chiefs laid siege to Anandpur Sahib, cutting off all supplies and forcing the Sikhs to survive on leaves and tree bark. Many, including the Guru’s mother, urged him to accept Wazir Khan’s offer of safe passage, backed by an oath on the Quran and promises from the hill chiefs. Knowing the enemy’s deceit, the Guru tested their sincerity by sending out bullock carts filled with worthless items, which were immediately looted. Despite this betrayal, continued pressure from his followers and mother left him with no choice but to agree to leave. On the night of December 20-21, 1704, under cold winds and rain, the Guru’s family and a group of Sikhs left first, led by Udai Singh, while the Guru planned to follow. However, as they moved out, the Mughals and hill forces broke their oath and attacked, leading to the chaotic and tragic Battle of Sarsa, where the Sikhs were scattered, and many lost their lives.

Crossing the Sarsa River and the Separation of Guru Gobind Singh’s Family
The usually dry Sarsa River had transformed into a raging torrent due to heavy rainfall in the hills, making it nearly impossible to cross. A group of Sikhs had gathered at the riverbank, waiting for Guru Gobind Singh to arrive. Meanwhile, the Guru, accompanied by his two elder sons and approximately 400 Sikhs, set out toward the river. However, before they could reach the crossing, a large Mughal force under Wazir Khan launched a fierce attack on them. At the same time, another Mughal unit assaulted the Sikhs waiting by the riverbank.
In the midst of torrential rain, biting cold, and the chaos of battle, confusion spread among the Sikhs. Many lost their lives, including Udai Singh and his warriors. Some brave Sikhs attempted to cross the treacherous river on horseback, carrying the Guru’s family with them. While they managed to reach the other side, they lost all their belongings, including valuable manuscripts, to the floodwaters.
Once across the river, the Guru’s family became separated. His mother, Mata Gujri, along with his younger sons, Baba Zorawar Singh and Baba Fateh Singh, could not travel far and were given shelter by Gangu, a former servant of the Guru’s household, who took them to his village, Saheri. Meanwhile, Mata Sundari and Mata Sahib Kaur, disguising themselves as village women, made their way toward Ambala for safety.
Guru Gobind Singh and his warriors also suffered heavy losses. Many Sikhs were either killed in battle or drowned while attempting to cross the river. By the time the Guru reached the other side, only 43 Sikhs remained with him, including his elder sons, Baba Ajit Singh and Baba Jujhar Singh, the Five Beloved Ones (Panj Pyare), and other warriors. As they resumed their journey, troubling news reached them—a Mughal force of nearly a thousand soldiers was advancing from Sirhind, while another enemy unit was making its way across the Sarsa River in pursuit.

Martyrdom of Sahibzada Ajit Singh and Sahibzada Jujhar Singh
After leaving Anandpur Sahib, Guru Gobind Singh and his Sikhs faced a desperate situation. They were surrounded by enemies—Mughal forces behind them and the hill chiefs who had betrayed them on their left. The Guru and his followers kept moving towards Chamkaur, but the Mughal army was fast approaching. Realizing the danger, the Guru halted near Chamkaur and sent two Sikhs into the village to find a safe place to stay. They found a small, two-story mud house with a large open courtyard. The house had two owners, and one of them offered his portion for shelter. Without delay, Guru Gobind Singh and his men quickly entered the house on the evening of December 21, 1704, just before the enemy could reach them. By the next morning, December 22, the Mughals had completely surrounded the house. Guru Gobind Singh divided his men into three groups—one was assigned to guard the main entrance, another took positions in the upper story to observe enemy movements, and the rest defended the surrounding walls to prevent the enemy from climbing over.: 87–88 </ref>: 293–296 
Before attacking, the Mughal commanders sent a messenger to persuade the Guru to surrender. They warned him that he was not fighting weak and disorganized hill chiefs anymore but the mighty Mughal Empire, ruled by Aurangzeb, who was known as ""the king of kings"" and ""the protector of the world."" They demanded that Guru Gobind Singh stop fighting, submit to Aurangzeb, and convert to Islam. When the messenger delivered this message, Baba Ajit Singh, could not tolerate the insult. He immediately drew his sword and warned the messenger that if he spoke another word, he would cut him into pieces. Enraged, the messenger returned to the Mughal camp with this defiant reply.
Soon after, the battle began. The Sikhs, dressed in their new uniforms prescribed by the Guru, stood firm despite being heavily outnumbered. The Mughals attacked with cannons and muskets, while the Sikhs responded with arrows and gunfire from behind the walls, windows, rooftops, and even through small gaps in the doors. The sound of gunfire and the clash of weapons filled the air as the Sikhs bravely defended themselves. The Mughal soldiers were struck down one after another, but the Sikhs also suffered heavy losses. Guru Gobind Singh later described the battle in a letter to Aurangzeb, saying that his small group of warriors had fought against thousands who had broken their oaths. He personally shot an arrow at Nahar Khan, a Mughal officer, forcing him to retreat. Many other Mughal leaders also fled from the battlefield, proving that their earlier boasts were empty.
As the battle raged on, Guru Gobind Singh watched his men fight to their last breath. Baba Ajit Singh, led a charge against the enemy, cutting down many soldiers before he was eventually overwhelmed and killed. His Younger brother, Baba Jujhar Singh, who was still in his early teens, also fought bravely, refusing to back down despite facing trained soldiers. One by one, the Sikhs fell, their bodies piling up in the courtyard and around the house. The battlefield was covered in blood, with severed heads and limbs scattered like broken toys. The sun set early on that short winter day, and by nightfall, only five Sikhs remained alive with Guru Gobind Singh.
As Guru Gobind Singh reflected on the day's sacrifices, the five surviving Sikhs made a bold decision. They declared themselves the Guru and ordered him to escape for the survival of the Khalsa. Obeying their command, he left at midnight with three Sikhs, while Sant Singh, who resembled him, stayed behind wearing the Guru’s clothes. When the enemy attacked again, they killed Sant Singh, believing him to be the Guru. This sacrifice allowed Guru Gobind Singh to escape,

Fatehnama
After Battle of Chamkaur, Guru Gobind Singh sent later to the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb.

Content
In the Fatehnama, Guru Gobind Singh expresses his grievances about the betrayal of oaths, stating that despite sworn promises, his army and civilians were attacked. He calls it a conspiracy that ultimately failed. The Guru asserts that he is still alive and prepared for battle. Despite his losses in the Battle of Chamkaur, he remains in Chardi Kala (eternal optimism and high spirits). He declares that he is neither afraid nor shaken by Aurangzeb’s attempts to destroy him. Guru Gobind Singh challenges Aurangzeb to bring his army to the battlefield, promising to bring his own. He suggests that both armies maintain a distance of three kilometers and proposes a duel where he will face Aurangzeb and his two lieutenants simultaneously.

Now, I do not trust in your oath, and I have no other alternative except drawing the sword… If you talk to me again, then I shall put you on the sacred and straight path.

Martyrdom of Sahibzada Zorawar Singh and Sahibzada Fateh Singh
After Battle of Sarsa, Gangu, along with Mata Gujri and the two young princes, Baba Zorawar Singh and Baba Fateh Singh, had crossed the flooded Sarsa River. They traveled to Rupar and then took the road to Morinda, where Gangu’s village, Saheri, was located. By this time, news of Guru Gobind Singh’s battle had spread everywhere. Fearing for his own safety, Gangu decided to betray them. He informed the government officials in Morinda about the people staying with him. As a result, Mata Gujri and the two children were arrested and sent to Sirhind, the headquarters of Wazir Khan. Gangu was rewarded with a simple ""Shabash"" (a word of praise), while the three captives were locked in a cold tower called Thanda Burj. Though this tower was used as a summer retreat for officials, it was extremely uncomfortable during the harsh winter, especially for the elderly Mata Gujri and the two young boys, who were just eight and five years old.: 88–89 

Wazir Khan was furious that he had failed to capture the Guru Gobind Singh. In his frustration, he decided to target the young sons of the Guru. On December 24, 1704, the two boys were brought before his court in a grand public gathering. Hundreds of armed soldiers stood around them to intimidate them. The Nawab’s men told the boys that their father, Guru Gobind Singh, their older brothers, and all Sikhs had been killed. They were offered a safe and comfortable life if they agreed to convert to Islam. However, the young princes boldly refused the offer, showing no fear. They reminded the court that their grandfather, Guru Tegh Bahadur, had also refused to convert to Islam and was martyred for his faith. A courtier named Suchanand Khatri insulted them, saying that the children of a snake are always venomous.
The next day, December 25, the boys were once again brought to the court. The officials used various methods to pressure them into converting, but nothing could shake their determination. Even Nawab Sher Muhammad Khan of Malerkotla, who had fought against Guru Gobind Singh in battle and lost his own relatives, was deeply moved by the courage of the young princes. Though he was opposed to the Guru, he refused to take part in harming the children when Wazir Khan asked him to.Wazir Khan ordered their execution. sentencing them to be bricked up in a wall. Even as they were placed inside, the boys remained steadfast in their faith. Enraged by their defiance, the soldiers pushed down the temporary wall made of mud and bricks. Finally, on December 27, 1704, the young princes were beheaded, and their bodies were disrespectfully discarded. Upon seeing their lifeless bodies, Mata Gujri could not bear the pain and passed away.

Cremation
A wealthy man named Todar Mal, who was a banker, took the responsibility of giving the children and Mata Gujri a proper cremation. He bought a piece of land for their funeral by laying gold coins on the ground as payment. The place where their bodies were discarded is now known as Gurdwara Fatehgarh Sahib. Another Gurdwara, called Gurdwara Jyoti Sarup, marks the site where their cremation took place Fatehgarh Sahib. Every year, two fairs are held at Gurdwara Fatehgarh Sahib—one in December to honor the children’s martyrdom and another in March during the festival of Hola Mohalla. Near Sirhind, there is also a memorial dedicated to Mata Gujri,

Anup Kaur’s Capture and Tragic End
Anup Kaur, a girl assumed to be Mata Jito's younger sister, was captured by Sher Muhammad Khan, Nawab of Malerkotla, who intended to add her to his harem. She was taken to Malerkotla where she took her own life.

Legacy
The legacy of Guru Gobind Singh and his sons, the Chaar Sahibzaade, holds an important place in Sikh history and culture. The city of Ajitgarh, formerly known as Mohali, was renamed in honor of Sahibzada Ajit Singh, and the surrounding district is now called Sahibzada Ajit Singh Nagar District.Sikh historian Ratan Singh Bhangu has compared Jujhar Singh’s martyrdom at Chamkaur to Abhimanyu’s sacrifice in the Mahabharata, noting that both fought in defense of their fathers. Additionally, one view on the origins of the Nihang Sikh tradition links it to Sahibzada Fateh Singh, whose blue attire, high turbans, and weaponry later became characteristic of the Akali Nihangs. A well-known account relates that Baba Fateh Singh appeared before Guru Gobind Singh dressed as a warrior, demonstrating a fearless demeanor that left an impression on even experienced soldiers; the Guru is reported to have predicted the emergence of a warrior sect in his likeness, which eventually became known as the Nihangs.

Although the festival is primarily based on elephants, other animals such as camels and horses also participate.

History
The Elephant Festival is considered one of the most popular and celebrated events in the city of Jaipur. Since the festival was introduced, the ceremony has managed to attract a variety of outsiders to the festive event. Elephants symbolize royalty according to the traditions of Rajasthan. The elephant is also believed to be associated with Buddhism and Jainism. In fact, the elephant itself has a historical significance in Indian traditions. According to Indian mythology, gods and the demons stirred the ocean, in the hopes that they would become eternal. Suddenly, nine jewels also known as the navratnas surfaced from the ocean. Of the nine jewels that reappeared, one of them was an elephant. Since then, the elephant has been regarded as a precious animal.
The state of Rajasthan was a popular destination for many royal figures as the kings and princes of those times would take elephant rides to the Amber Palace of Rajasthan. During the monarchy, India’s royalty would hold events where the strongest elephants would fight each other to entertain the royal guests.
Nowadays, the festival is organized every year by the Rajasthan tourism group in the Chaugan Stadium. The venue was relocated to the Jaipur Polo Group grounds due to the festival’s increasing popularity.  The elephants are sacred and are believed to have good luck.

Controversy
For the first time in many years, the Elephant Festival was cancelled for two consecutive years, 2012 and 2014, due to protest from the Animal Welfare Board. The animal activists were concerned about the chemical-laced colour being poured on the elephants and feared that the elephants would be harmed in the process. The Rajasthan tourism group, which hosts the festival every year failed to sign up the elephants with the Animal Welfare Board and provide appropriate documents. As a result of this, the organizers decided to rename the event the Holi Festival. The Tourism Department’s decision to cancel came in the wake of protests by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).

It is the celebration of spring, harvest, marital fidelity, conjugal blessedness, and childbearing. Unmarried women worship the goddess in hopes of being blessed with a good husband, while married women do so for the welfare, health, and long life of their husbands.

Etymology
Gana is a Sanskrit term that means group, associated with Shiva, while Gauri is an epithet of Parvati.

Description
The festival commences on the first day of Chaitra, the day following Holi, and continues for 16 days. For a newly-wedded girl, it is binding to observe the full course of 18 days of the festival that succeeds her marriage. Unmarried girls fast for the full period of 16 days and eat only one meal a day. The festivities conclude on the third day of the shukla paksha (the first fortnight between the new moon day and the full moon day) of Chaitra. Gangaur melas (fairs) are held throughout the 18-day period. Numerous folklores are associated with Gangaur associated with the regions of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, and Gujarat.
Murtis (idols) of Shiva and Parvati are made of clay for the festival. In some families, permanent wooden images are painted afresh every year by reputed painters called matherans on the eve of the festival. A distinct difference between the idols of Teej and Gangaur is that the idol will feature a canopy in the Teej festival while the Gangaur idol does not have a canopy.
Women decorate their hands and feet by drawing designs with mehndi (myrtle paste). The figures drawn range from the Sun, Moon, and the stars to simple flowers or geometrical designs. Ghudlias are earthen pots with numerous holes all around and a lamp lit inside them. On the evening of the 7th day after Holi, unmarried girls go around singing songs of ghudlia carrying the pots with a burning lamp inside, on their heads. On their way, they collect small presents of cash, sweets, jaggery, ghee, oil etc. This continues for 10 days i.e. up to the conclusion of the Gangaur festival when the girls break their pots and throw the debris into the well or a tank and enjoys a feast with the collection made.
The festival reaches its climax during the last three days. The images of Gauri and Isar (Shiva) are dressed in new garments especially made for the occasion. Unmarried girls and married women decorate the images and make them look like living figures.
At an auspicious hour in the afternoon, a procession is taken out to a garden, bawdi, johad, or well with the images of Isar and Gauri, placed on the heads of married women. Songs are sung about the departure of Gauri to her husband's house. The procession comes back after offering water to the first two days. On the final day, the procession concludes with the immersion of all the images into the waters of a tank or a well.

Legend
The story behind the festival (vrata kathā) is narrated as follows:
Once, Shiva, along Parvati and Narada, toured the earth. When they came across a village, the poor women of the settlement, who learnt of their identities, offered whatever water, fruits, and flowers were available to honour the divine couple. Shiva and Parvati were pleased by the devotion of the women. Parvati collected the water in her hand and sprinkled it as nectar upon the women, blessing them with lasting marriages. After their departure, the richer women of the village propitiated the couple, offering them a choice of dishes. Shiva asked his consort how she intended to bless these women, having distributed all her nectar upon the poor women before. Parvati responded that she would offer the rich women with the same fortune as herself, cutting one of her own fingers, sprinkling the blood upon the women before her, which turned into more nectar, blessing them as well. Following this event, Parvati bathed in a nearby river and worshipped Shiva in the form of a lingam, which she created from sand. Propitiated, Shiva appeared before her and proclaimed that all married women who worshipped his consort and he on the third lunar day of the fortnight of Chaitra would be granted a lasting marriage.

Celebrations
Jaipur
In Jaipur, a sweet dish called a ghevar is characteristic of the Gangaur festival. People buy ghevar to eat and distribute it among their friends and relatives. A procession, with the image of Gauri, commences from the Zanani-Deodhi of the City Palace. It then passes through Tripolia Bazaar, Chhoti Chaupar, Gangauri Bazaar, Chaugan stadium and finally converge near the Talkatora. People from all walks of life come to witness the procession.

Udaipur
Udaipur has a dedicated ghat named after Gangaur. Gangaur Ghat or Gangori Ghat is situated on the waterfront of Lake Pichola. This ghat serves as prime location for celebration of multiple festivals, including Gangaur festival. Traditional processions of Gangaur commences from the City Palace, and several other places, which passes through various areas of the city.

History
It is said that in the princely state of Bundi, Raja Balwant Singh, king of Bundi Ka Gothra, when talking to his friend about the grand procession for Teej in Jaipur decided to bring the same idol of Teej to Bundi. When the Teej procession was going on in Jaipur, Raja Balwant Singh attacked and looted the idol of Teej and brought it to Bundi and after 15 days, Teej started being celebrated in Bundi with royal pomp. Since then, the festival of Kajali Teej has been celebrated in Bundi.
It is also said that at that time the idol of Teej which was taken out of Amber Fort in Jaipur was made of gold. The king had looted it and brought it to Bundi. After that, the procession of the impersonated idol of Teej Mata started taking place in Jaipur. Earlier the royal people used to come out on Bundi Teej procession, later after democracy was established, the local municipal body started organising this event.

This Urs festival is held over six days and features night-long dhikr (zikr) qawwali singing. The anniversary is celebrated in the seventh month of the Islamic lunar calendar. Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims, many from foreign countries, visit the shrine from all over India. The Indian Railways run special trains during his festival to bring devotees to Ajmer.
At the start of this annual festival, the hoisting of the historical flag and a 21-gun salute ceremony is held at Chishti's mausoleum since 1944. The sixth day of the Urs is regarded as the most special and auspicious. It is called ""Chhati Sharif"".  It is celebrated on the 6th Rajab between 10:00 A.M. and 1:30 p.m. inside the Mazaar Sharif or shrine complex. Shijra, or the genealogical tree associated with the Chishti Order, is read by duty bound Khadims of Moinuddin Chishti, and then there is Fariyad (prayers).
Just before the Qu'l (conclusion of Chhati Sharif), Badhaawa (a poem of praise) is sung at the main entrance of the shrine by Qawwals.
Badhaawa is a recitation accompanied only by clapping; no musical instrument is played. It was composed by Syed Behlol Chishty, an ancestor of the present day Chishty Sufis of Ajmer Sharif called Syedzadgan Khadim Khwaja Sahib. After its recitation, the ceremony of the Qu'l comes to an end, and Fatiha is recited. The end of the ceremony is marked by firing a cannon at 1:30 p.m.

History
Ganesha
Though not alluding to the classical form of Ganapati, the earliest mention of Ganapati is found in the Rigveda. It appears twice in the Rigveda, once in shloka 2.23.1, as well as in shloka 10.112.9. Both of these shlokas imply a role of Ganapati as ""the seer among the seers, abounding beyond measure in food presiding among the elders and being the lord of an invocation"", while the shloka in mandala 10 states that without Ganapati ""nothing nearby or afar is performed without you"", according to Michael. However, it is uncertain that the Vedic term Ganapati which literally means ""guardian of the multitudes"", referred specifically to later era Ganesh, nor do the Vedic texts mention Ganesh Chaturthi. It appears in post-Vedic texts such as the Grhya Sutras and thereafter ancient Sanskrit texts such as the Vajasaneyi Samhita, the Yajnavalkya Smriti and the Mahabharata mention Ganapati as Ganesvaras and Vinayak. Ganesh appears in the medieval Puranas in the form of ""god of success, obstacle remover"". The Skanda Purana, Narada Purana and the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, in particular, profusely praise him. Beyond textual interpretations, archaeological and epigraphical evidence suggest Ganesha had become popular and was revered before the 8th century CE and numerous images of him are traceable to the 7th century or earlier.
For example, carvings at Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain temples such as at the Ellora Caves, dated between the 5th and 8th-century show Ganesha reverentially seated with Shakti, another Hindu goddess.

Festival
Although it is unknown when (or how) Ganesh Chaturthi was first observed, the festival has been publicly celebrated in Pune since the era of King Shivaji (1630–1680, founder of the Maratha Empire). The Peshwa in the 18th century were devotees of Ganesha and started as a public Ganesh festival in their capital city of Pune during the month of Bhadrapad. After the start of the British Raj, the Ganesh festival lost state patronage and became a private family celebration in Maharashtra until its revival by Indian freedom fighter and social reformer Lokmanya Tilak. Indian freedom fighter Lokmanya Tilak, championed it as a means to circumvent the colonial British government ban on Hindu gatherings through its anti-public assembly legislation in 1892. Lokmanya Tilak started the festival in Pune and Girgaon, Mumbai. 

I followed with the greatest curiosity crowds who carried in procession an infinite number of idols of the God Ganesh. Each little quarter of the town, each family with its adherents, each little street corner I may almost say, organizes a procession of its own, and the poorest may be seen carrying on a simple plank their little idol or of paper mâché... A crowd, more or less numerous, accompanies the idol, clapping hands and raises cries of joy, while a little orchestra generally precedes the idol.– Angelo de Gubernatis, Bombay Gazette (1886)

According to others such as Kaur, the festival became a public event later, in 1892 when Bhausaheb Laxman Javale (also known as Bhau Rangari), installed the first sarvajanik (public) Ganesha idol in Pune. In 1893, the Indian freedom fighter Lokmanya Tilak praised the celebration of Sarvajanik Ganesh Utsav in his newspaper, Kesari, and dedicated his efforts to launch the annual domestic festival into a large, well organised public event. Tilak recognised Ganesh's appeal as ""the god for everybody"", and according to Robert Brown, he chose Ganesha as the god that bridged ""the gap between Brahmins and non-Brahmins"", thereby building a grassroots unity across them to oppose British colonial rule.
Other scholars state that the British Empire, after 1870 out of fear of seditious assemblies, had passed a series of ordinances that banned public assembly for social and political purposes of more than 20 people in British India, but exempted religious assembly for Friday mosque prayers under pressure from the Indian Muslim community. Tilak believed that this effectively blocked the public assembly of Hindus whose religion did not mandate daily prayers or weekly gatherings, and he leveraged this religious exemption to make Ganesh Chaturthi to circumvent the British colonial law on large public assembly. He was the first to install large public images of Ganesha in pavilions in Bombay Presidency, and other celebratory events at the festival.

According to Richard Cashman, Tilak recruited and passionately committed himself to god Ganesha after the 1893 Hindu-Muslim communal violence in Bombay and the Deccan riots, when he felt that the British India government under Lord Harris had repeatedly taken sides and not treated Hindus fairly because Hindus were not well organised. In Tilak's estimate, Ganesha worship and processions were already popular in rural and urban Hindu populations, across social castes and classes in Baroda, Gwalior, Pune and most of the Maratha region in the 18th century. In 1893, Tilak helped expand Ganesh Chaturthi festival into a mass community event and a hidden means for political activism, intellectual discourse, poetry recitals, plays, concerts, and folk dances.
In Goa, Ganesh Chaturthi predates the Kadamba era. The Goa Inquisition had banned Hindu festivals, and Hindus who did not convert to Christianity were severely restricted. However, Hindu Goans continued to practice their religion despite the restrictions. Many families worship Ganesha in the form of patri (leaves used for worshiping Ganesha or other gods), a picture is drawn on paper or small silver idols. In some households Ganesha idols are hidden, a feature unique to Ganesh Chaturthi in Goa due to a ban on clay Ganesha idols and festivals by the Jesuits as part of the Inquisition.

Celebration in India
In India, Ganesh Chaturthi is primarily celebrated at home and in public by local community groups in the central and western states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Goa and the southern states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and eastern states of West Bengal and Odisha and in North eastern state of Assam. 
On the same day, Chaurchan festival is celebrated in Mithila region of Bihar which is related to Ganesha and Chandra, the Hindu moon god.
The date for the festival is usually decided by the presence of Chaturthi Thithi. The festival is held during ""Bhadrapada Madyahanaa Purvabaddha"". If the Chaturthi Thiti begins at night on the previous day and gets over by morning on next day, then the next day is observed as Vinayaka Chaturthi.
In the consecration ceremony, a priest performs a Prana Pratishtha to invite Ganesh like a guest. This is followed by the 16-step Shodashopachara ritual, (Sanskrit: Shodash, 16; Upachara, process) during which coconut, jaggery, modaks, durva grass and red hibiscus (Jaswand) flowers are offered to the idol. Depending on the region and time zone, the ceremony commences with hymns from the Rigveda, the Ganapati Atharvashirsa, the Upanishads and the Ganesh stotra (prayer) from the Narada Purana are chanted. In Maharashtra as well as Goa, aarti is performed with friends and family, typically in the morning and evening.
In preparation for the festival, artisans create clay models of Ganesha for sale. The images (Murtis) range in size from 20 mm (3⁄4 in) for homes to over 20 m (70 ft) for large community celebrations.
On the last day of the festival, the tradition of Ganesh visarjan or nimajjanam (lit. ""immersion"") takes places, when the Ganesha images are immersed in a river, sea or water body. On the last day, the devotees come out in processions carrying the idols of Ganesha, culminating in immersion. It is believed that the god who comes to the earthly realm on Ganesh Chaturthi, returns to his celestial abode after immersion. The celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi also denotes the significance of the cycle of birth, life and death. It is believed that when the idol of the Ganesha is taken out for immersion, it also takes away with it the various obstacles of the house and these obstacles are destroyed along with the immersion. Every year, people wait with great anticipation to celebrate the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi.

Domestic celebration
In Maharashtra, Ganesh Chaturthi is known as Ganeshotsav. Families install small clay Murtis for worship during the festival. At home, the festival preparation includes purchases such as puja items or accessories a few days in advance and booking the Ganesh murti as early as a month beforehand (from local artisans). The murti is brought home either a day before or on the day of the Ganesh Chaturthi itself. Families decorate a small, clean portion of the house with flowers and other colourful items before installing the idol. When the Murti is installed, it and its shrine are decorated with flowers and other materials. On the day of the festival, The ceremonial installation of the clay murti (idol) is done along with chants of holy mantras and puja including bhajans during a certain auspicious period of the day. The Murti is worshipped in the morning and evening with offerings of flowers, durva (strands of young grass), karanji and modaks (jaggery and coconut flakes wrapped in rice flour dumplings). The worship ends with the singing of an aarti in honour of Ganesh, other Gods and Saints. 
In Maharashtra the Marathi aarti ""Sukhakarta Dukhaharta"", composed by the 17th-century saint, Samarth Ramdas is sung.
Family traditions differ about when to end the celebration. Domestic celebrations end after 1+1⁄2, 3, 5, 7 or 11 days. At that time the Murti is ceremoniously brought to a body of water (such as a lake, river or the sea) for immersion. In Maharashtra, Ganeshotsav also incorporates other festivals, namely Hartalika and the Gauri festival, the former is observed with a fast by women on the day before Ganesh Chaturthi whilst the latter by the installation of Murtis of Gauris. In some communities such as the Chitpavan, and the CKP, pebbles collected from river bank are installed as representations of Gauri.
In Goa, Ganesh Chaturthi is known as Chavath in Konkani and Parab or Parva (""auspicious celebration""); it begins on the third day of the lunar month of Bhadrapada. On this day Parvati and Shiva are worshipped by women, who fast. Instruments such as ghumots, crash cymbals (ताळ(taal) in Konkani) and pakhavaj (an Indian barrel-shaped, two-headed drum)  are played during the rituals. The harvest festival, Navyachi Pancham, is celebrated the next day; freshly harvested paddy is brought home from the fields (or temples) and a puja is conducted. Communities who ordinarily eat seafood refrain from doing so during the festival.
In Karnataka the Gowri festival precedes Ganesh Chaturthi, and people across the state wish each other well. In Andhra Pradesh, Ganesh Murtis of clay (Matti Vinayakudu) and turmeric (Siddhi Vinayakudu) are usually worshipped at home with plaster of Paris Murti's.

Public celebration
Public celebrations of the festival are popular and are organized by local youth groups, neighborhood associations, or groups of tradespeople. Funds for the public festival are collected from members of the association arranging the celebration, local residents and businesses. The Ganesh idols and accompanying Musti are installed in temporary shelters, known as mandaps or pandals. Public preparations begin months in advance. The making of the Murti in Maharashtra usually begins with ""Padya pooja"" or worshipping the feet of Ganesh. The Murtis are brought to ""pandals"" on the day or a day before the festival begins. The pandals have elaborate decoration and lighting.
The festival features cultural activities such as singing, theatre and orchestral performances and community activities such as free medical checkups, blood-donation sites and donations to the poor. Ganesh Chaturthi, in addition to its religious aspects, is an important economic activity in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Nashik, Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Indore, Surat, Hyderabad, Visakhapatnam, Bangalore, Chennai and Kurnool. Many artists, industries, and businesses earn a significant amount of their living from the festival, which is a stage for budding artists. Members of other religions also participate in the celebration.
In Tamil Nadu, the festival, also known as Vinayaka Chaturthi or Pillayar Chaturthi, falls on the fourth day after the new moon in the month of Āvaṇi in the Tamil calendar. The idols are usually made of clay or papier-mâché, since Plaster of Paris idols have been banned by the state government, but violations of this rule are often reported. Idols are also made of coconuts and other organic products. They are worshipped for several days in pandals and immersed in the Bay of Bengal the following Sunday. In Kerala the festival is also known as Lamboodhara Piranalu, which falls in the month of Chingam. In Thiruvananthapuram a procession marches from the Pazhavangadi Ganapathi Temple to Shankumugham Beach, with tall Murti of Ganesha made from organic items and milk immersed in the sea.

At prominent temples
At Varasidhi Vinayaka Swamy Temple in Kanipakam, Andhra Pradesh, annual brahmotsavams will be celebrated for 21 days starting from Vinayaka Chavithi day. The processional deity of Vinayaka (Ganesh) will be taken in a procession on different vahanams on these days amidst large number of pilgrims across the country.

Celebration outside India
In Pakistan, Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations are conducted by the Shri Maharashtra Panchayat, an organisation for Maharashtrians in Karachi.
Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated in the UK by the British Hindu population living there. The Hindu Culture and Heritage Society, a Southall-based organisation, celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi for the first time in London in 2005 at the Vishwa Hindu Temple; and the idol was immersed in the River Thames at Putney Pier. Another celebration, organised by a Gujarati group, has been celebrated in Southend-on-Sea, and attracted an estimated 18,000 devotees. Annual celebrations are also held on the River Mersey in Liverpool, in the North Sea at Clacton-on-Sea, and Caldecotte Lake in Milton Keynes.
The Philadelphia Ganesh Festival is one of the most popular celebrations of Ganesh Chaturthi in North America, and it is also celebrated in Canada (particularly in the Toronto area), Detroit Metropolitan area-Wayne State university, Mauritius, Malaysia and Singapore. The Mauritius festival dates back to 1896, and the Mauritian government has made it a public holiday. In Malaysia and Singapore, the festival is more commonly known as Vinayagar Chaturthi because of the large Tamil-speaking Hindu minority.
In Ghana, ethnic African Hindus celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi.

Foods
The primary sweet dish during the festival is modak (modak in Marathi and Konkani, modakam or kudumu in Telugu, modaka or kadubu in Kannada, kozhakatta or modakkam in Malayalam and kozhukattai or modagam in Tamil). A modak is a dumpling made from rice or wheat flour, stuffed with grated coconut, jaggery, dried fruits and other condiments and steamed or fried. Another popular sweet dish is the karanji (karjikai in Kannada), similar to modak in composition and taste but in a semicircular shape. This sweet meal is called Nevri in Goa and is synonymous with Ganesh festival amongst the Goans and the Konkani diaspora.
In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana modak, laddu, vundrallu (steamed, coarsely ground rice-flour balls), panakam (a jaggery-, black pepper- and cardamom-flavoured drink), vadapappu (soaked moong lentils) and chalividi (a cooked rice flour and jaggery mixture) are offered to Ganesh. These offerings are known as naivedya, and a plate of modak traditionally holds 21 pieces of the sweet. In Goa, modak and a Goan version of idli (sanna) is popular.
Panchakajjaya is an offering made to Ganesh during this festival in parts of Karnataka. It is a mixture of desiccated coconut, roasted Bengal gram powder, sugar, ghee, and sesame. Different versions of panchakajjaya are made. Roasted Bengal gram, green gram, roasted chana dal (putani) or aval can be used.

Environmental impact
The Madras High Court ruled in 2004 that immersion of Ganesh idols is unlawful because it incorporates chemicals that pollute the sea water. In Goa the sale of plaster-of-Paris Ganesha idols has been banned by the state government and celebrants are encouraged to buy traditional, artisan-made clay idols. Recent initiatives to produce traditional clay Ganesh idols in Hyderabad have been sponsored by the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board. Environmental concern is also making people in Gujarat to opt for Ganesh idols made with a mixture of cow dung and clay. These are marketed as ""Vedic Ganesh idols"" by the organization making them.
Due to environmental concerns, a number of families now avoid bodies of water and let the clay murtis disintegrate in a barrel of water at home. After a few days, the clay is spread in the garden. In some cities a public, eco-friendly process is used for the immersion.

At least 27 pilgrims, 13 of them women, died and 20 others injured in a stampede at a major bathing spot on the banks of the Godavari river where a huge crowd of devotees had gathered on the opening day of 'Pushkaram' festival.

Etymology
""Maha"" means ""great"" and Pushkaram refers to the worship of the river in which the god Pushkar appears every 12 years. Pushakaram is spelled Pushkaralu in Telugu, Pushkaram in Tamil, Pushkara in Kannada, and Pushkar in Hindi.

Background
Pushkaram is an Indian festival dedicated to worshiping of 12 sacred rivers. The celebration happens annually, once in 12 years along each river. Each river is associated with a zodiac sign, and the river for each year's festival is based on which sign Bruhaspathi (Jupiter) is in at the time. It is believed that bathing in the sacred river during Pushkaram cleanses the devotees of their sins.
Godavari is one of the 12 sacred rivers, and the Godavari Pushkaram takes place once every 12 years, when the Jupiter is in the Leo sign. The Maha Pushkaram (""Great Pushkaram"") takes place once every 144 years.

Festival dates
The 2015 Godavari Pushkaram is believed to be a Maha Pushkaram, which happens once in 144 years. During the year 2015, Jupiter enters Leo on 14 July 2015 (Tuesday) at 6.26 AM, when the Maha Pushkaram begins, and ends after 12 days on 25 July 2015 (Saturday).
Multiple almanac writers and other skeptics have disputed that the 2015 Godavari Pushkaram is a ""Maha Pushkaram"". According to Hanmanthavajjula Subrahmanya Sarma, the president of State Drukghanitha Almanac Writers’ Association, the ""theory of 144 years is a myth"", and nobody knows ""who calculated it and how they calculated it"".

Details of locations
The places on the banks of the Godavari River where pilgrims visit famous temples are in the five districts of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The notable places are Manthani, Basar, Dharmapuri, Koti Lingala, Kaleshwaram, Bhadrachalam in Telangana and Rajahmundry, Kovvur, Narasapuram, Antarvedi in Andhra Pradesh.

Facilities
The Maha Pushkaram festival in 2015 attracted 4.81 crore people in Andhra Pradesh and 5.7 crore people in the Telangana state link from all parts of India. On this occasion, it is essential to take a holy dip in the Godavari River to get the supposed benefits of better physical and mental abilities. The Governments of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have made all arrangements for this event in their respective states by constructing ghats for bathing and improving road communications, basic amenities of water supply and sanitation, and security. In Andhra Pradesh. the budget allocated for improvement of infrastructure facilities is INR 1,295 crores.

Symbolism
An emblem titled ""Godavari Maha Pushkaram 2015"" and ""Godavari Pushkaramalu"" has been adopted by the state governments for this festival, and a special organization under the same name has also been instituted to address all issues related to the smooth functioning of the festive event. The emblem or logo with a simple design has lines to denote the rapid flow conditions of the Godavari River, a ""jyoti"" a glowing light, and the representation of offering oblation, called ""Arghyam"", to Surya, the Sun god.
Another symbolic event  proposed during the festival is to hold ""Sobha Yatra"", a procession carrying the sacred waters of the Godavari River to be mixed with water bodies in all the villages in the 13 districts which lie within the ambit of the Godavari River.
A religious symbolic performance called the ""Godavari Arathi"", a ritual of worship with a number of lamps is also proposed to be held at Rajahmundry where the river flows out to the sea.

It is conducted in other locations either on the day of Deepavali or 1 day after Deepavali so that people from all locations can attend Pedha Sadar on 3rd day (2 days after Deepavali) at Narayanguda YMCA and take part in largest congregation of Yadavs.

Go Puja
The Sadar Festival starts with Chowdhary performing Go Puja.

Go Puja
This is one of the variants of Govardhan Puja being performed. In this variant of the ritual, a goddess (Lakshmi Puja) is made out by spreading cow dung as base layer and then Rangoli decoration is added as second layer and top layer a mountain is made of puffed rice, sweet candy and decorated pots. After completing the idol, an earthen lamp (diya) is placed on top. This represents Govardhan giri.

Carnival starts
Once puja is completed, the first male buffalo in the procession is brought over and made to stomp over the lit diya. This is the official commencement of the Sadar festival.

With this, the Carnival/Procession of Sadar starts and each family with their Dunnapothu (Male Buffalo) come with all fanfare.

Festival Highlights
Buffaloes are the main highlight of the parade, as the community is dependent on cattle for their livelihood. They take special care in breeding cattle which mainly consists of water buffaloes and cows. Bulls are bred mainly for bigger height, weight and length of body. They are also considered better by amount of milk their female offsprings yield. Other details like looks, age, horn style, length of tail are considered. Hence Sadar becomes occasion to display these special bulls to rest of community.

Buffalo Decoration
Every family takes this opportunity to showcase their best male buffalo to the rest of the community in the parade. Buffaloes are decorated by shining them with oil, painting their horns/body with bright colors, garlands around neck, anklets (gajjalu) on their feet, sea-shell bands with bells around neck or foreheads and also adorned with peacock feathers cases on their horns.

Buffalo Salam
Some families also make their buffalo do salam and dandam to show respect and obedience to Chowdary. Families train their buffaloes for months to perform these two types of salutes. In the end it displays the agility of buffalo to be able to stand only on its hind legs.

Alai Balai
All the community members wish each other Deepavali wishes and take Alai-Balai. Alai balai is a way of hugging another person from either side of shoulders.

Da-Dan-Ki beats
Another highlight of this festival is Yadavs play unique tune during the parade called Da-Dan-Ki tune. This tune is so unique and reserved for Yadavs that now it is being simply called as Yadav tune. This music is also associated with special stepped dance that will be performed by Yadav men. In this dance, men form an circle holding hockey sticks in one hand and taking big steps back and forth and circling around at same time. This dance is also called 'pedha puli ata' which means tiger dance as it looks like men are imitating tiger's gait and moves. Likewise this dance is more commonly being called as Yadav dance.

History
There are many legends about the miraculous powers of Sammakka. According to a 13th-century tribal legend, some tribal leaders on a hunt found a newborn girl (Sammakka) enveloped in light playing amidst tigers. They took her to the tribal chief, who adopted and raised her as a leader. She later became the saviour of the tribals of the region. She was married to Pagididda Raju, the tribal chief of the Koyas. Medaram was ruled by the Kakatiyas (with their headquarters in Warangal city between 1000 AD and 1323 AD). Sammakka had two daughters and one son, Sarakka alias Saralamma, Nagulamma, and Jampanna. King Prataprudra of the Kakatiyas imposed taxes on the Koya Tribe, which they could not pay. As a result, King Prataprudra declared war on the Koya Tribe. Pagididda Raju was killed in the ensuing battle forcing the grief-stricken Sammakka to pick up the fight with her daughter Saralamma, her son Jampanna, and her son-in-law Govinda Raju. Sammakka had almost won when Saralamma died in the battle. Jampanna was mortally wounded and fell bleeding into Sampangi vaagu (stream). Legend has it that the stream turned red from the blood, and the stream was renamed ""Jampanna Vaagu"" in honour of Jampanna's sacrifice. Distraught, Sammakka retired to a hill called Chilakala Gutta and turned into a (kumkuma bharani) jar filled with kumkuma powder. After the battle, Sammakka and Saralamma were deified and a festival was organized in her honour once every 2 years. To this day, the Koya tribe and devotees believe that Sammakka and Saralamma are manifestations of Adi Parashakti sent to protect them. 
The jatara is a celebration to honour this sacrifice. The Kumkuma jar is brought to Medaram and people wash themselves in Jampanna Vaagu, followed by an offering of Jaggery to Sammakka and Saralamma.

Ritual
This Jatara is held Biannually i.e once in two years for four days. It starts with the arrival of the goddesses to Gaddelu in Medaram and ends with their vanapravēsham (entry into the forest).
Day 1 :- Wednesday 
Sarakka's idol is carried from Kannepalli to Medaram. Pagididda Raju's idol is carried from Poonugondla to Medaram.
Day 2 :- Thursday
Sammakka's idol and the Kumkum casket are carried to Medaram (usually by midnight) after long secret pujas by the Koya tribes on Chilakala gutta (the hill where the Kumkum casket is kept). Govinda Raju's idol is carried from Kondai to Medaram.
Day 3 :- Friday (peak day of the Jatara) (believed to be the day Adi Parashakti is worshipped)

Sammakka Sarakka Jatara is a tribal Hindu festival, held at about 100km from Warangal city. It is the time for the largest tribal congregation in the world, held every two years (biennial), with approximately ten million people converging on the place, over a period of four days. Many devotees from different states of India (Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Maharashtra, Karnataka and parts of Jharkhand) reach the festive place to celebrate the Jatara.
People offer bellam (jaggery) equal to their weight to the goddesses and take a holy dip in Jampanna Vagu (stream).
In 2008, nearly 8 million people were estimated to have attended the festival. And in 2012, the gatherings in the jatara are roughly estimated to be 10 million. This fair is said to be the largest repeating congregation of tribal communities in the world. It is also one of the largest Hindu gatherings in the world.
This Festival held in 2016 is the first one after the formation of Telangana state, and it took a greater significance with special attention from the state government.

Jampanna Vagu
Jampanna Vagu, originally known as ""Sampangi Vagu"" is a tributary to the river Godavari. According to history, Jampanna was a tribal warrior and the son of tribal goddess Sammakka. The Jampanna Vagu took his name as he died in a battle fighting against the Kakatiyan Army in that stream. Tribals believe that taking a holy dip in the  water of Jampanna Vagu honours and reminds them of the sacrifice of their gods who saved them and also induces courage in their souls.
There is a bridge constructed on top of Jampanna Vagu, known as the Jampanna Vagu Bridge.

Offering Gold/ Jagri
Most people offer gold in the form of Jagri as gratitude for their wishes like getting marriage, having kids, jobs, business etc. Weight of the gold is based on the individual's weight. In the year 2024, CM of Telangana offered gold which weighed 65 Kgs. Based on historians, people used to carry jagri while traveling to the Medaram as it is good dehydrant and also Jagri is not available for tribals. it was so precious for them.

Transport
The Jatara venue is situated at about 100 km from Warangal, 160 km from Khammam, 170 km from Karimnagar, 190 km from Suryapet, 250 km from Hyderabad and 320 km from Rajahmundry (via Bhadrachalam & Manuguru).
Until 1978, the only way to reach Medaram was by a bullock cart. In 1978 then the Andhra Pradesh State Government declared the 1000-yr old festival as official and laid down a paved road. TSRTC runs multiple buses to the venue during the Jatara period. Also, many private vehicles render their services for plying the visitors and aerial view services (such as using a helicopter) are also provided during this festival.
The Jatara is very well facilitated with roads, potable water, sanitation, health and hygiene by the Government of Telangana.

The same day is observed as a New Year by Hindus in many other parts of India, such as Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra, Goa and is a national public holiday in Mauritius.

Etymology
The name Yugadi or Ugadi is derived from the Sanskrit words yuga (age) and ādi (beginning): ""the beginning of a new age"". Yugadi or Ugadi falls on ""Chaitra Shudhdha Paadyami"" or the first day of the bright half of the Indian month of Chaitra. This generally falls in late March or early April of the Gregorian calendar.
The Telugu people use the term Ugadi (ఉగాది) and the Kannadigas use the term Yugadi (ಯುಗಾದಿ) for this festival.

Practices
The Kannada and Telugu communities in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu celebrate the festival with great fanfare; gatherings of the extended family and a sumptuous feast are 'de rigueur'. The day begins early with ritual showers, rubbing the body with perfumed oil, followed by prayers.

Preparations for the festival begin a week ahead. Houses are given a thorough clean. People buy new clothes, including dhoti, and buy new items for the festival, decorate the entrance of their houses with fresh mango leaves. Mango leaves and coconuts are considered auspicious in the Hindu tradition, and they are used on Ugadi. People also clean the front of their house with water and cow dung paste, then draw colorful floral designs. People offer prayers in temples. The celebration of Ugadi is marked by religious zeal and social merriment. According to Vasudha Narayanan, a professor of Religion at the University of Florida:

The pacchadi festive dish symbolically reminds the people that the following year – as all of life – will consist of not just sweet experiences, but a combination of sweet, sour, salty, and bitter episodes. Just as the different substances are bound together, one is reminded that no event or episode is wholly good or bad. Even in the midst of bitter experiences, there are sweet moments. One is also reminded that the experience of taste is transitory and ephemeral; so too, is life, and one has to learn to put pain and pleasure in proper temporal perspective.

Special dishes are prepared for the occasion. In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, foods such as pulihora, bobbatlu (Bhakshalu/ polelu/ oligale), New Year Burelu and Pachadi, and preparations made with raw mango go well with the occasion. Of these, pachadi (or Ugadi pacchadi) is the most notable, and consists of a chutney-like dish which combines ingredients to give all six flavours of food : sweet, sour, salty, spicy, bitter and astringent. This festive Hindu food is made from tamarind paste (sour), neem flowers (bitter), brown sugar or sweet jaggery (sweet), table salt (salt), green chilli (spicy) and raw mango (astringent). It is a symbolic reminder of complex phases of life one should reasonably expect in the new year.
In Karnataka, foods such as Holige or Obattu, and mango pickles are made. In addition, a speciality of yugadi in Karnataka is to create ""bEvu-bella"" a mixture of neem and jaggery, to signify both the sweet and the bitter or the sihi-kahi(ಸಿಹಿ-ಕಹಿ). This symbolizes life's own experiences with a little bit of bitterness and a hint of sweetness.

Related festivals
Maharashtran Hindus refer to the festival, observed on the same day, as Gudi Padwa (Marathi: गुढी पाडवा). The Sindhis celebrate the same day as Cheti Chand, which is the beginning of their calendar year. Manipuris also celebrate their New Year as Sajibu Nongma Panba on the same day.
The Hindus of Bali in Indonesia also celebrate their new year on the same day as Nyepi. Ugadi is one of the five Hindu national public holidays in Mauritius.

It is observed on the 11th lunar day of the waxing lunar fortnight of the solar month of Dhanu.

It is primarily observed by Vaishnavas, who regard it to be a special ekadashi. It coincides with Mokshada Ekadashi or Putrada Ekadashi. It is observed on the 11th lunar day of the waxing lunar fortnight of the solar month of Dhanu. This falls between 16 December and 13 January in the Gregorian calendar.

Legend
The origin of Vaikuntha Ekadashi is mentioned in a legend of the Padma Purana. There was once an asura named Murāsura, who was a nightmare to the devas, owing to a boon he had received from Brahma. They sought the assistance of Vishnu, who fought against the asura in a battle, but was unable to defeat him. He travelled to a cave called Simhavati in the vicinity of Badarikashrama, where he was pursued by Murāsura. There, Vishnu summoned Yogamaya, a goddess created from his divine energy, who slew the asura. Vishnu, who was pleased, offered the goddess the epithet 'Ekadashi', and declared that she would be capable of vanquishing the sins of all the people of Earth. In Vaishnava tradition, it is held all those who observe a fast on the occasion and worship Ekadashi would attain Vaikuntha. Thus came into being the first Ekadashi, which was a Dhanurmasa Shukla Paksha Ekadashi.
According to a later story, there was once a Vaishnava king of Ayodhya called Ambarisha, who always maintained his vow of fasting for the occasion. Once, after three days of fasting for the occasion, he was about to break his fast, when the sage Durvasa appeared at his city's gates. The king received the sage with honour, and offered him a meal, which the latter accepted, but went first to perform his ritual ablutions. Even as Ambarisha waited for a long while, the sage did not return, and the auspicious moment of breaking his fast approached. He faced a dilemma: If he did not break his fast before the day was over, the act of his fasting would not bear fruit; However, if he ate a single morsel of food before Durvasa returned, that was regarded as disrespectful. He decided to simply sip some water, which broke his fast, but was hoped to not prove to seem insulting to the sage. Durvasa was infuriated when he returned, and tore a clump of hair from his head, which was sent charging to attack the king. The Sudarshana Chakra of Vishnu intervened to destroy the clump, which then proceeded to chase the sage. Durvasa fled, attempting to seek the protection of Brahma and Shiva, but the two deities denied him refuge. Finally, Durvasa begged for his life from Vishnu himself, who informed him that his salvation lay at the hands of his devotees. Accordingly, Durvasa sought forgiveness from Ambarisha, and was saved.
According to another legend, Vishnu opened the gate of Vaikuntha (his abode) for two asuras (demons) in spite of their being against him. They also asked for this boon: Whoever listens to their story, and sees the image of Vishnu coming out of the door called Vaikuntha Dvaram, would reach Vaikuntha as well. Temples all over India make a door kind of structure on this day for devotees to walk through.

Significance
Vaishnavism
Vaishnavas (Devotees of Vishnu) believe that ‘Vaikuntha Dvaram’ (the gate to Vaikuntha) is opened on this day. The Margashirsha Shukla Paksha Ekadashi in the Lunar calendar is known as a 'Mokshada Ekadashi.' Special prayers from the Vedas, Naalayira Divya Prabandham, Vaikuntha Gadyam as well as the Vaikuntha Dvara Puja, Prakarothsvam (Sri Veli), Oonjal Seva (swing pooja), Oonjal Prabhandham, yagnas, discourses, and speeches are arranged at several Vishnu temples around the world on this auspicious day.
Vaikuntha refers to the abode of the Hindu preserver deity, Vishnu. Vaishnavas consider the feet of Vishnu to be Vishnupada, or Parama Padam (Ultimate feet), as it is regarded to be the realm for Vishnu and his devotees to reside in the suddha-sattva, or the supreme state of purity and goodness.
In Vishnu temples, Vaikuntha Ekadashi is part and parcel of Dhanurmasam (Margaḻi) vratam and its puja. Fasting for the entire month of Dhanurmasam is practised by several Vaishnavas, including temperance and food restrictions for Sri Vaishnavas.
According to the Vishnu Purana, fasting on Vaikuntha Ekadashi is equivalent to fasting on the remaining 23 ekadashis of the (Hindu) year. However, according to Vaishnava tradition, fasting is mandatory on all ekadashis of both Shukla paksha and Krishna paksha. Fasting on Ekadashi is considered holier than any other religious observation.  Complete fasting has to be observed on Ekadashi, the 11th day of the paksha. That is why the meal on the Dvadashi (the 12th day) is designed to be wholesome, nutritious, and filling.

Fasting
Vaikuntha Ekadashi fasting is an important aspect of those associated with it. People fast the whole day and keep vigil. Special prayers are offered to Vishnu and devotees engage in Japa (chanting of Vishnu's name) and Dhyana (Meditation). On 'Dashami', the previous day of the observance, devotees who take up Vaikuntha Ekadashi fasting are to take only lunch. On Ekadashi, the next day, they have to maintain a complete fast and engage in prayers and meditation of Vishnu. They are strictly prohibited from taking rice. That night, people keep vigil the whole night and visit the temple of Vishnu, mostly in the wee hours of the morning.
The Shaiva sect observes the day as Trikoti Ekadashi, a religious observance where adherents regard it to be the date when all the deities in the Hindu pantheon pay obeisance to Shiva.

Celebrations
The celebrations of the occasion span across all Venkateswara temples. The most important for this particular festival is considered to be in Srirangam which is specifically known for the Svarga Vasal opening. The next most important is considered to be in Tirupati in the Tirumala hills, which houses the highly venerated abode of Venkateswara.

Srirangam
At the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam Vaikuntha Ekadashi celebrations last for 20 days, divided into two parts: pagal pathu (morning part 10 days) and Ira pathu (night part 10 days). Vishnu, as the mulavar (central temple idol) of Ranganatha, is regarded to bless devotees in his Muthangi, an armuor of pearls, on all 20 days. On the 10th day of Pagal Pathu (previous day of Vaikuntha Ekadashi), the utsavar (processional idol), named Namperumal, is believed to bless devotees, in his form as Mohini.
On Vaikuntha Ekadashi, during daybreak, Namperumal is regarded to bless devotees, clad in an armour of diamonds and gems, and brought to the thousand-pillared hall from the sanctum sanctorum, through the northern gate known as Paramapada Vasal, the gate to Vaikuntha. This gate is opened once in a year, only on the occasion of Vaikuntha Ekadashi. It is said that anyone who goes through the Paramapada Vasal will attain Vaikuntha. For this reason, it is also known as the Svarga Vasal.

Tirupati
The Tirumala Venkateswara Temple also has a similar concept to celebrate Mukkoti Ekadasi, as it is known in the Telugu-speaking regions. Tirumala has a special entrance called Vaikunta Dvaram that encircles the sanctum sanctorum. The dvaram (gateway) is opened only on Vaikunta Ekadasi, and it is believed that any person who passes through this 'Vaikunta Dvaram' on this particular day attains Vaikunta. The temple witnesses heavy inflow of pilgrims and dignitaries for Vaikunta Ekadashi.

It is celebrated across various parts of South Asia observed on the full moon day in the month of Chittirai, corresponding in the Gregorian calendar to a day in April or May.

Legend
The tale of Chitra Purnima is centred on Indra, the kings of the devas, and his Brihaspati, based on the folklores of Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam. According to legend, Indra and Brihaspati once got into an argument over something Indra said to Brihaspati. Brihaspati, Indra's guru, gave him instructions to make a pilgrimage to the earth in order to atone for his negative karma.
After accepting, Indra carried out his guru's wish. Indra discovered a shivaling while on the trip under the kadamba tree. Later, he came to understand that it was Shiva who was aiding him in lessening his bad deeds. He soon began presenting lotus flowers to Shiva as an act of adoration. This legend is believed to have occurred at Madurai by adherents. Devotees perform pujas at the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai to worship Shiva.

Practices
In some parts of India, The festival is dedicated to Chitragupta, a Hindu god who is believed to record humans' good and bad deeds for Yama, the Hindu god of death and the underworld. On this day, devotees ask Chitragupta to give them good thoughts and deeds which will benefit all living beings. 
On the festival day, many devotees gather around rivers or places where the moon is visible to have dinner with family and friends. It is believed by doing this they can get the blessings of Chandra and feel the happiness and bond with their loved ones. It is also believed by lighting up an deepam to Chandra alleviates negative states of mind. This is especially popular at the river Chitra in the district of Tirunelveli  in Tamil Nadu, India.
The observance is called Chitira Pournami in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, especially by followers of Kaumaram and Shaiva Siddhanta. Devotees observe fasting, worship Murugan, and break their fast the next morning. Adherents believe that moonlight dispels the darkness of one's soul. Murugan worship and the festivals of the deity start on this day every year.

The two sides clashed during elections. Violence erupted notably in the districts of Ramanathapuram and Madurai which claimed over 40 lives. Devendrar was killed at this time and the anniversary of his death is today celebrated by various political parties and community organisations and civil societies as Devendrar Jayanthi.

Devendrar Jayanti is among the celebrations sometimes criticised as being designed mainly as expressions of caste pride and political power, which sometimes turn into inter-caste violence.
These critics are rebutted by people who say that every caste has its own leader and the people are celebrating the memories of their leaders. Despite these arguments every year the government is struggling to maintain the law and order during these celebrations.

It is mainly observed mainly by Tamils in India, Sri Lanka and other regions with significant Tamil diaspora. The festival is celebrated on the first full moon day of the month of Kartika coinciding with Kṛttikā nakshatra, falling on the Gregorian months of November or December. Though it corresponds to the Kartik Purnima, it falls on a different day due to the correction of equinoxes in the Tamil calendar. 
The festival is associated with Shaivism, is celebrated to commemorate the origin of Kartikeya, the Hindu god of war, and Shiva's manifestation as Jyotirlinga. In Kerala, it is celebrated as Thrikarthika, in honour of goddess Parvati.

History
One of the earliest references to the festival is found in the Tamil anthology Akanaṉūṟu, dating back to the Sangam period (200 BCE to 300 CE). The festival is referred in songs of poetess Avvaiyar. The festival is also referred in the Sangam literature as Peruviḻa.

Theology
According to the Kanda Puranam, three asuras (a race of celestial beings) Surapadman, Tarakasuran, and Singamukhan performed austerities to propitiate god Shiva. Shiva granted them various boons which gave them near-immortality and the ability to conquer the three worlds. They subsequently started a reign of tyranny in their respective realms which forced the celestial beings devas to plead with Shiva for his assistance. In response, Shiva manifested five additional heads and a divine spark emerged from each of the six heads. The sparks were carried by wind-god Vayu, and fire-god Agni to Ganga river. The water in the Ganga started evaporating due to intense heat, and so the goddess Ganga took them to the Saravana lake, where each of the sparks developed into a baby boy. The six boys were raised by handmaidens known as the Kṛttikās and they were later fused into one by Parvati, thus giving rise to the six-headed Kartikeya. As per Hindu mythology, the six Kṛttikās–Śiva, Sambhūti, Prīti, Sannati, Anasūya, and Kṣamā, who helped in rearing the child, were granted with immortality by Shiva and transformed to become eternal stars in the sky as a part of the Pleiades star cluster. The festival commemorates the Kṛttikās and the day Parvati united the six forms of Kartikeya.
According to the Shiva Purana, Brahma (the god of creation) and Vishnu (the god of preservation) had an argument over their supremacy.
 To settle the debate, Shiva took the form of jyotirlinga, an infinite pillar of light.  Shiva declared that the dispute would be resolved if the two could discover his head and feet. Vishnu took the form of a boar Varaha and descended to locate his feet, while Brahma rode his swan Hamsa to locate his head. Vishnu failed in his search of the feet and returned, honest about the outcome of his quest. However, Brahma chanced upon a Pandanus flower falling down from Shiva's head and presented the same to Shiva claiming that he had seen Shiva's head. The dishonesty of Brahma angered Shiva, causing him to curse the creator deity that he would not be worshipped; he also declared that Vishnu would be eternally worshipped for his honesty. The festival is celebrated to commemorate the manifestation of Shiva as jyothirlinga.

Occurrence
Karthika Deepam is a festival of lights observed mainly by Hindu Tamils in India, Sri Lanka and other regions with significant Tamil diaspora. The festival is celebrated on the first full moon day of the month of Kartika coinciding with Kṛttikā nakshatra, falling on the Gregorian months of November or December.

In Kerala, the festival is known as Thrikarthika, and is celebrated in as a form of veneration to goddess Parvati.

The 10-day festivities are also observed with lesser crowds in the Magha month (about February) every year between the 12-year Maha (major) cycle. In the interim years, the event is called the Masi-maham festival.

Legend
The Mahamaham tank is surrounded by small temple mandapas with Vedic and Puranic deities, each with a Shiva linga in the sanctum. It also features the big Kashi Vishwanathar temple to its north. At the entrance temple gate, there is the image of Shiva with nine Indian river goddesses: Ganga, Yamuna, Sarasvati, Narmada, Godavari, Krishna, Tungabhadra, Kaveri, and Sarayu. Portions of the Periya Purana are inscribed inside the mandapas and the temple. The complete legend is found on the inner walls of the Kumbheshvara temple near the water pool. According to this legend, after the end of each cyclic existence, there is a Mahapralaya (great flood) when Shiva helped save all creation by floating all seeds of creation and amritam (nectar of immortality) in a pot (kumbha). The flood subsided and the pot came to rest on ground, which was broken by an arrow by Shiva in a hunter form. This spilled the contents into a large pool that became the Mahamaham tank. Another legend is painted pictorially. This shows Brahma being instructed by Shiva to preserve all seeds of creation and life forms in a giant kumbha (pot) during a great flood. It floats to Meru, survives the floods, and when the floods end the pot comes to rest near the banks of Kaveri river in a place now called Kumbhakonam. Shiva, in the form of Kiratamoorty (hunter) breaks it and the water inside the pot becomes the Mahamaham tank. The coconut on top of the pot breaks and becomes the lingas. The pot parts were memorialized by the many mandapa and temples near the tank and the Kumbhakunam region: Kumbeswara, Someswara, Kasi Viswanatha, Nageswara, Kamata Viswanatha, Abimukeshwara, Goutameswara, Banapuriswara, Varahar, Lakshminaryana, Sarangapani, Chakrapani and Varadharaja.
Astronomically, Maha maham or magha festival is celebrated in the month when full moon occurs as moon is passing Magha nakshatra (Leo sign) and Sun is on the other end in the opposite Aquarius sign (Kumnha Rasi). Mahamagham occurs once in twelve years when the planet Jupiter's residence in Leo coincides with full-moon in Leo. On the day of the festival in the month of Magha, it is believed to bring all water bodies together and water is rejuvenated.

History
The antiquity of the event is deduced from the architectural and epigraphy. The visit of Krishnadevaraya (1509–1529) is recorded in an inscription in the gopuram of Nagalpuram, a village in Chengalpattu district. That Krishnadevaraya visited the event is also recorded in the inscription found in the Shiva temple in Kuthalam. The ceiling of the Gangatirtha mandapam carries the sculptural representation of Tulapurushardava. It is believed that the 16th-century Nayak era prime minister Govinda Dikshitar attended the event and donated gold which help build the sixteen mandapas.
The tank is significant particularly to the South Indian Hindus. The festival is a symbolic equivalent to the Kumbh Mela pilgrimage at Prayaga in Uttar Pradesh.

The festival
The Masimaham is an annual event that occurs in Kumbakonam in the Tamil month of Masi (February–March) in the star of Magam. Vast crowds of Hindu devotees gather at Kumbakonam to have a dip in the tank. All the rivers of India are believed to meet at the tank on this day and a purificatory bath at this tank on this day is considered equal to the combined dips in all the holy rivers of India. Festival deities from all the temples in Kumbakonam arrive at the tank and at noon, all the deities bathe along with the devotees - it is called ""Theerthavari"". The purificatory bath is believed to remove sins and after the dip, pilgrims offer charitable gifts in the hope of being rewarded in the current life and subsequent lives. The temple cars of major temples in Kumbakonam come around the city on the festival night. During the Mahamaham of 1992, the number of devotees were estimated to be one million.
During the time of Mahamaham festival, it is believed that the famous Indian river goddesses Ganges, Yamuna, Sarasvati River, Sarayu, Godavari River, Tungabhadra River (alternately Mahanadi River), Narmada River, Krishna River, and Kaveri River. These arrive here to rejuvenate and get repurified through Ganga and with Shiva's blessing. This cyclic event makes this a sacred site and the waters holy to cleanse one of any sins they may have committed or absorbed from others. which are mixed together in Mahamaham tank, would get rid of sins. The images of the deities indicating the legend, is housed in the nearby Kasi Viswanatha Temple.
In the northern bank mandapa, there is an inscription of Tulapurshadana, a practise of weighing oneself against gold. The ceremony is observed during various times like equinoxes, commencement of an era (Yuga) and its ending, eclipses and Makara Sankranti. The ceremony is usually performed in sacred places like temples, rivers and tanks. The amount of gold thus weighed is distributed among deserving men.

The tank
The tank is located in the heart of Kumbakonam city which is near the Kaveri river. The tank and temple premises spread over 20 acres, while the water pool with ghat-like steps covers an area of over 6 acres. It is square in its original design, but infrastructure upgrades and extensions have made it somewhat trapezoidal in shape. The tank is surrounded by 16 small mandapams (shrines) and has 21 wells inside the tank.  The names of the wells carry the name of Lord Shiva or that of Rivers of India. Govinda Dikshitar, the chieftain of Ragunatha Nayak of Thanjavur, constructed the sixteen mandapams and stone steps around this tank.
The Mahamaham tank has four streets along its four banks. It is constructed with steps on the sides for people to easily access the tank and take dips. There are 16 mandapas (Gopuram Towers) around the corners and sides of the tank. These towers are considered to be forms of Shiva.

Pongal is generally a four-day festival of fervent celebrations (during 2010, it will be held from 13 to 16 January) marking the officially declared Tamil New Year day, the beginning of the month of Thai starting with 14 January every year, as per Tamil Calendar. The first day is called Bhogi – the last day of Dhanurmas (month of Sagittarius), a preparatory day before the Pongal and is in honour of god Indra, the king of heaven. On this day it is spring cleaning, as people decorate their homes, buy new vessels and burn old and unwanted items. Pongal, the main festival, also called the Perum Pongal (big festival), is the second day when the Sun is worshipped signifying the first day of the month of Makara or Capricornus. It is celebrated as Makara Sankranti or simply ""Sankranti"" in the rest of the country. This is followed by the 'Mattu Pongal' celebration on the third day when bulls, cows and other farm animals are worshipped. The fourth day is the 'Kannum Pongal' or 'Kanru Pongal' (Calf Pongal) festival when calves are fed. However, the name 'Kannum' also denotes that on this day people visit elders in the villages or towns seeking their blessings.
On each of the four days festival, Kolam or threshold drawings are drawn with coloured rice powder or chalk powder, in the front yard of the houses, after due washing of the yard. On the first day images of rice are drawn, on the second day good luck signs of Sun are drawn and the Mattu Pongal day Kolam depicts cows also.

On all four days, Shiva's consort Parvati and their son Ganesha are worshipped and the Pongal – the rice preparation – is offered to them in the puja and thereafter to the cattle. The neck of the pot in which Pongal rice is prepared is tied with fresh turmeric leaves and pieces of sugarcane. Ingredients cooked in the pot consist of rice, green gram and milk. While cooking, the overflow of milk is particularly observed as it has significance to the householder. If the milk over flows on the right side of the pot, it is considered an auspicious augury. Sometimes, an image of Ganesha is crafted with cow-dung. This crafted Ganesha is then bedecked with arugampul (kind of grass), thumbai (white flowers) and avaram (yellow flowers). The pongal cooked in mud pots are placed on the floor where a Kolam is drawn and skirted with red sand. Then, pongal-rice along with turmeric, ginger, sugar cane, yellow garlands and a stick that is used to drive the bulls are also placed as offering to Ganesha.
In some practices, Pongal is celebrated for three days with Kannum Pongal or Kannu Pongal observed concurrently with the Mattu Pongal. Sisters symbolically offer small part of the rice dishes prepared for the festival or coloured balls of cooked rice to crows and other birds such as sparrows, as a special prayer for the well-being of their brothers. While making this offering to crows, they call out with words in Tamil, ‘Kakai Ku Pudi, Kuruvi Ku Pudi’, which literally means ""this rice ball is for the crow, this rice ball is for the sparrow.""
On the Mattu Pongal day, cattle are washed, their horns painted and decorated with shining metal caps. Multi-coloured beads, tinkling bells, sheaves of corn and flower garlands are tied around their necks. Turmeric and kumkum are also devotionally put on the foreheads of the cattle. The cow–keepers dressed in their regale sprinkle the cattle with saffron water with mango leaves with prayers to protect them from evil and shout the popular slogan of the festival, ""பொங்கலோ பொங்கல்!"" (""Pongaloo Pongal!""). This prayer is a special wish for the progressive prosperity and growth of the cattle population, with the blessings of Indra and Krishna (Gopala), who was a cowherd. Devotees pay their respect to cows by bending down, like praying in a temple, and touching their feet and foreheads, followed by an aarti (showing camphor flame to the object of praise) and offering the cattle prasad (food offering, in this case is called Sakkar Pongal – a delicacy cooked of rice, moong dal (green gram) with jaggery and dry fruits). The cattle are taken in a procession, attended by bands of music, through the village streets to a public space in the village. The resounding of their bells attracts the villagers as the young men race each other's cattle. Then the entire atmosphere becomes festive and full of fun and revelry. Big commotion is seen when the game ""Jallikattu"" or ""Manji Virattu"" starts in which groups of young men chase the running bulls.

Jallikattu
Jallikattu (lit. bull embracing) initially was a bull taming village sport held in the afternoon or evening of the Mattu Pongal celebrations. This sport was popular in the southern part of Tamil Nadu, particularly in Madurai, Tiruchirapalli and Tanjavur. On this day, the bulls, which were worshipped and fed during the day, their horns were tied with bundles of money in the form of coins or notes. The young boys chased such bulls, lassoed them and retrieved the money tied to the horn. If they failed the bulls ran away and were seen only the next morning. But this was a milder form of the sport which was seen in most villages in Tamil Nadu 500 years back. This traditional sport changed during the Nayaka rule in Tamil Nadu From a harmless bull-chasing sport it got transformed into the present form of Jallikattu, which is a bloodier bull-wrestling sport that takes place now in villages throughout Tamil Nadu, to celebrate Mattu Pongal. Jallikattu, as an ancient sport of Tamil Nadu, has been corroborated from rock paintings of 'bull chasing sport' discovered on massive rock surfaces at Karikkiyur in Nilgiris in Tamil Nadu, which are dated between 2,000 B.C. and 1,500 B.C.
The jallikattu events that are held now are in a well organised manner by bull owners and the youthful village men. In the present form, prizes are offered to the bull fighters and the bull owners. The bull fight is held, at a central location in the village where people assemble in large numbers to witness the fight. It is held in an enclosure with a 30 feet (9.1 m) marker. The bulls that are specially trained for this occasion are then led from the pen to the ring to fight, one by one, when young boys of the village grab the bull by its horn or neck or tail and try to hold on to it. If the boys are thrown off or hurt seriously within the ring no prize is given to them. If they hold on or even thrown off but are not in any way injured then the prize is given to them. If the contesting young men hold on to the bull from the marker entrance of the pen then they are given prizes. If the bulls win, then the prizes go to the bull owners. It is said that in some villages as many as 600 bulls, 600 participants and 10,000 spectators participate. The fight between man and the bull is quite fierce and many times bloody. It is considered a heroic act on the part of the young men. The young participants show off their heroism by displaying the number of cuts they have suffered during such fights. This type of fight is said to be akin to the bull fights of Spain. However, in this case, the fight is to win prizes by holding on to the bulls’ neck or horn. The bull is never killed, however many boys get killed by goring by the bull since they fight with their bare hands and with confidence of their strength. In many instances, the audiences watching the fight have also been injured by the ferocious bulls. In recent years, there have been deaths of young boys during this festival, which has created a furore among the public. In one year, there was a report of death of as many as 20 young men, apart from mauling and trampling of spectators.
As result of deaths of young men, the Supreme Court was approached to stop this festival, as it was considered inhuman and dangerous. The plea made was that the Jallikattu was ""backward, dangerous, a violation of animals’ rights and detrimental to India's modernizing image."" The stoppage of the festival, however, resulted in protests by the villagers who wanted this sport to continue. Finally, on assurances given by the State government that enough security and safety arrangements would be provided at all such sports locations in the villages, Jallikattu has been permitted to be observed as part of the Mattu Pongal festival. As a result of court's intervention, doctors are ready at call to attend to injured young men or boys. A two tier high bamboo fencing is also erected between the bull ring and the audience who come to witness the fight in large numbers.

Similarities in other religions
Studies on similarities in the holding of Hindu seasonal festivals, particularly in South India, which are termed pre-historic, with those of Christianity in Europe, indicate that such similarities may not be coincidental. The winter solstice is the date of Sun entering Capricorn in both the traditions that coincides with Makara Sankranti (called Uttarayana meaning the return of the luminary to the northern region), the first day of the new year starting with the month Magha according to the Hindu Tamil calendar. This corresponds to 21 December per Christian date and is called the sign of the Goat, while the same happens in mid-January according to Hindu calendar. Makara Sankranti is celebrated among the Hindus for three days, with Mattu Pongal (feast of cattle) held the day after Sun entering Capricorn. (There is a slight variation in dates followed for the festival, varying from year to year, but the essence of observing Makara Sankranti is the same among Hindus). Worship of cattle by Hindus during Mattu Pongal has a striking similarity with the Catholic function held on 17 January in Rome as Saint Anthony day, when cattle (the cows, horses, goats, asses and so forth) are blessed. Wilson has allegorically given an analogy:

The time of the year, the decorating of the cattle, the sprinkling of them with water, and the very purport of the blessing, that they may be exempt from evils, are so decidedly Indian, that could a Dravira Brahmin be set down of a sudden in the Piazza, and when he asked what ceremony he witnessed, there can be no doubt of his answer; he would at once declare they were celebrating the Pongal.

It celebrates the deity Angala Parameswari Amman, a manifestation of Parvathi, in her form as the goddess Mahakali.

Mythological background
The festival commemorates the story of when Shakti, in her manifestation as Parvathi, saved her husband Shiva from peril through her wit and power. 
Beset by demons, Tilottam, a being of divine beauty, sought refuge in the abode of Lord Shiva, to which the god Brahma followed her. Brahma, like Parvati's husband Shiva, had five heads and therefore Parvati mistook him for her husband and fell at his feet in an act of submission. Angered by this, Shiva took the form of the deity Rudra and beheaded the fifth head of Brahma, invoking a curse upon himself – the head became attached to Shiva's right hand and consumed all the available food, leaving Shiva himself with none. He therefore became a mendicant and roamed the earth begging for food, sleeping in graveyards.
Parvathi pleaded with her brother, the protector god Vishnu, for a solution. He came up with the idea to trick Brahma's head: Parvathi and Shiva would to go to a graveyard, make a pond there, prepare food from hummingbird tree leaves and chicken blood, and serve that food to the head attached to Shiva. The head would then detach from Shiva's hand to eat the food. Thus Parvathi freed Shiva from the head, and purified him in the pond, after which the head could not approach Shiva in his purified state. However, the head then attached itself to Parvathi. Through a sacred cosmic dance, Parvathi amassed sufficient power to destroy the head by brushing it with her right foot. In this fierce form, Parvathi is known as Angara Rubam and Angalaamman, from which the temple at which the festival occurs takes its name.

Practice

The holiday is a festival of Tamil origin, said to pre-date Vedic religion. The central activity of the festival is a puja at the temple, followed by a procession, where an idol of Parvathi is carried to a graveyard or crematorium. An idol of Pavadairayan, a Dravidian hero of legend, follows that of Parvathi. The procession concludes at the crematorium, where sacrifices including cooked foods and animals such as chickens and lambs are presented to the deities.
Local artists also craft effigies or figurines of deities from dry grass, paper, and paint. They are carried by devotees in the procession. This is a spiritual practice for many of the sculptors, who adhere to strict vegetarian diets while engaged in this work.
Due to the large events, security is generally deployed to manage crowds at Mayana Kollai observances.

Hindus regard this as the day the deity Vishnu assumed his fourth avatar in the form of a ""man-lion"", known as Narasimha, to vanquish the oppressive asura king Hiranyakashipu and protect his devotee Prahlada. The legend of Narasimha represents the victory of knowledge over ignorance and the protection offered by God to his devotees.

Legend
In Hindu mythology, Hiranyakashipu was the first incarnation of Jaya, one of the two doorkeepers of Vishnu's abode of Vaikuntha. After being cursed by the Four Kumaras, along with his brother, Vijaya, he chose to be born as an enemy of Vishnu thrice, rather than as a devotee of the deity seven times. After the death of his brother, Hiranyaksha, at the hands of Varaha, the third avatara of Vishnu, Hiranyakashipu swore revenge. The king performed a severe penance to propitiate the creator deity, Brahma, until the latter appeared to grant him a boon. The asura desired the inability to be slain neither inside his house nor outside, by day nor night, by any weapon, neither on the ground nor in the sky, by neither men nor beasts, deva nor asura, nor any being created by Brahma. He also asked for rulership of all living beings and the three worlds. His wish granted, Hiranyakashipu overran the three worlds with his invincibility and his forces, seizing the throne of Indra in Svarga, and subjugating all beings, except the Trimurti, under his rule.
Hiranyakashipu's son, Prahlada, grew devoted to Vishnu, due to spending his childhood at Narada's ashrama. Angered that his son prayed to his sworn enemy, Hiranyakashipu attempted to indoctrinate him under various teachers, including Shukra, but to no avail. The king determined that such a son must die. He employed poison, snakes, elephants, fire, and warriors to slay Prahlada, but the boy was saved by praying to Vishnu on each attempt. When the royal priests attempted to indoctrinate the prince once more, he converted the other pupils to Vaishnavism. The priests created a trishula (trident) to murder the boy, but it slew them instead, after which Prahlada restored them to life. Shambarasura and Vayu were tasked with killing him, but failed. Finally, the asura had his son tied to nooses of snakes, and hurled into the ocean, with mountains launched to crush him. Prahlada remained unscathed. Frustrated, Hiranyakashipu demanded to know where Vishnu resided, and Prahlada responded that he was omnipresent. He asked his son if Vishnu lived in a pillar of his chamber, and the latter affirmed in response. Furious, the king smashed the pillar with his mace, whence Narasimha, part-man, part-lion, appeared before him. The avatara dragged Hiranyakashipu to the doorway of the palace, and ripped him apart with his claws, his form placed upon his lap, during twilight. Thus, circumventing the boon granted to the asura king, Narasimha was able to rescue his devotee, and restore order to the universe.

History
Narasimha Jayanti is referenced in the Padma Purana and Skanda Purana as Narasimha Chaturdashi. The worship of Narasimha has been present in South India for millennia, with the Pallava dynasty popularising the sect and its practices. Inscriptions have also been found referring to the occasion dating back to the Vijayanagara Empire.

Religious practices and traditions
Narasimha Jayanti is primarily observed by Vaishnavas, the adherents of Vishnu, in the South Indian states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and northern Tamil Nadu, where the veneration of Narasimha is popular. Narasimha and Lakshmi Narasimha temples throughout the aforementioned regions hold special pujas in honour of the deity during various time periods of the occasion. In the household, the shodashopachara puja is performed in the morning, and the panchopachara puja is performed in the evening, both by men.
Members of the Sri Vaishnava tradition traditionally observe fasting until the evening, and consume food after prayer. A beverage called panakam is prepared from jaggery and water, and is distributed to the Brahmins during the festivities. 
In Karnataka, community feasts are organised by certain temples to celebrate the occasion.

Bhagavata Mela
Every year on Narasimha Jayanti, a traditional folk dance known as the bhagavata mela is publicly performed in Melattur, a village in Tamil Nadu. The term ""bhagavata"" refers to the Bhagavata Purana, a prominent Hindu text in the Vaishnava tradition, while ""mela"" refers to traditional dancers or singers. Thus, this folk dance enacts stories from the Bhagavata Purana using specific dance techniques and karnatāka musical style. One particular performance that is ""noteworthy for its dramatic impact and ritual significance"" is the story of Prahlada and Narasimha.

Etymology
Thai Pongal is a combination of two Tamil language words: Thai (Tamil: 'தை') referring to the tenth month of the Tamil calendar and Pongal (from pongu) meaning ""boiling over"" or ""overflow."" Pongal also refers to a sweet dish of rice boiled with milk and jaggery that is ritually prepared and consumed on the day. It is also referred to as Tamizhar thirunal (""the festival of Tamil people"").

History
The principal theme of Pongal is thanking the Sun god Surya, the forces of nature, and the farm animals and people who support agriculture. The festival is mentioned in an inscription found at the Veeraraghava Swamy Temple. Attributed to the Chola king Kulottunga I (1070–1122 CE), the inscription describes a grant of land to the temple for celebrating the annual Pongal festivities. The ninth century Shaiva Bhakti text Tiruvempavai by Manikkavacakar details the festival. It appears in Tamil texts and inscriptions with variant spellings such as ponakam, tiruponakam, and ponkal. Temple inscriptions from the Chola and Vijayanagara periods detail recipes similar to pongal recipes of the modern era with variations in seasonings and relative amounts of the ingredients. The terms ponakam, ponkal and its prefixed variants might also indicate the festive pongal dish as a prasadam (religious offering) which were given as a part of the meals served by free community kitchens in South Indian Hindu temples either as festival food or to pilgrims every day.

Observance
Pongal is a multi-day Hindu harvest festival celebrated by Tamils. The three days of the Pongal festival are called Bhogi, Thai Pongal, and Mattu Pongal. Some Tamils celebrate a fourth day of Pongal known as Kanum Pongal. While the festival is observed for three or four days in Tamil Nadu, but for one or two days in urban locations and by the Tamil diaspora outside South Asia.

Bhogi
Bhogi marks the first day of the Pongal festivities and is celebrated on the last day of the Tamil calendar month Marghazhi. On this day people discard old belongings and celebrate new possessions. The people assemble and light a bonfire in order to burn the heaps of discards. Houses are cleaned, painted and decorated to give a festive look. Prayers are offered to Indra, the king of Gods with thanks and hopes for plentiful rains in the year ahead. Kaappu kattu is a tradition of tying leaves of Azadirachta indica, Senna auriculata and Aerva lanata in the roofs of houses and residential areas that is widely practiced in the Kongu Nadu region. Bhogi is observed on the same day in the South Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Fruits of the harvest are collected along with flowers of the season and a mixture of treats along with money is given to children, who then separate and collect the money and sweet fruits.

Thai Pongal
Thai Pongal is the main festive day, celebrated on the next day of Bhogi. It is observed on the first day of the Tamil calendar month of Thai, and usually falls on 14 or 15 January as per the Gregorian calendar. It is dedicated to the Sun deity Surya and corresponds to Makar Sankranti, the harvest festival under various regional names celebrated throughout India. According to tradition, the festival marks the end of winter solstice, and the start of the sun's six-month-long journey northwards when the sun enters the Capricorn, also called as Uttarayana.
Dedicated to Surya, it is celebrated with family and friends with new clothes worn and the preparation of the traditional pongal dish in an earthen pot. The pot is typically decorated by tying a turmeric plant or flower garland and placed in the sun along with sugarcane stalks. The homes are decorated with banana and mango leaves, decorative florals and kolams. Relatives and friends are invited and when the pongal starts to boil and overflow out of the vessel, participants blow a conch or make sounds while shouting ""Pongalo Pongal"" (""may this rice boil over""). In rural areas, people sing traditional songs while the pongal dish is cooking. The Pongal dish is first offered to Surya and Ganesha, and then shared with the gathered friends and family. People traditionally offer prayers to the sun in the open and then proceed to eat their meal. A community Pongal is an event where families gather at a public place for a ceremonial worship.

Mattu Pongal
Mattu Pongal (""Madu"" meaning cow in Tamil) is the third day of the festival meant for the celebration of cattle. The cattle is regarded as sources of wealth as it is a means for dairy products and fertilizers, used for transportation and agriculture. The cattle are bathed, their horns are polished and painted in bright colors with garlands of flowers placed around their necks and taken for processions. Some decorate their cows with turmeric water and apply shikakai and kumkuma to their foreheads. The cattle are fed sweets including pongal, jaggery, honey, banana and other fruits. People may prostrate before them with words of thanks for the help with the harvest.

Kanum Pongal
Kanum Pongal or Kanu Pongal is the fourth day of the festival and marks the end of Pongal festivities for the year. The word kanum in the context means ""to visit"" and families hold reunions on this day. Communities organize social events to strengthen mutual bonds and consume food and sugarcane during social gatherings. Young people visit elders to pay respects and seek blessings, with elders giving gifts to the visiting children.

Traditions and practices
Pongal is traditionally an occasion for decorating, offering prayers in the home, temples, getting together with family and friends, and exchanging gifts to renew social bonds of solidarity. It is viewed more as a ""social festival"" since the contemporary celebrations do not necessarily link it to temple rituals. Temples and cultural centers organize the ritual cooking of Pongal dish, along with fairs (Pongal mela) with handicrafts, crafts, pottery, sarees, ethnic jewelry for sale. These sites hold traditional community sports such as Uri Adithal (""breaking a hanging mud pot while blindfolded""), Pallanguzhi and Kabbadi, as well as group dance and music performances in major cities and towns.
The festival is marked with colorful kolam artwork. Kolam is a form of traditional decorative art that is drawn by using rice flour often along with natural or synthetic color powders. It includes geometrical line drawings composed of straight lines, curves and loops, drawn around a grid pattern of dots.

The festival is named after the ""Pongal"" dish, which forms the festival's most significant practice. The dish is prepared by boiling freshly harvested rice in cow milk and raw cane sugar. Additional ingredients such as coconut and ghee along with spices such as cardamom, raisins and cashews are also used. The cooking is done in a clay pot that is often garlanded with leaves or flowers, sometimes tied with a piece of turmeric root. It is either cooked at home, or in community gatherings such as in temples or village open spaces. The cooking is done in sunlight, usually in a porch or courtyard and the dish is dedicated to the Sun god, Surya. After it is traditionally offered to the gods and goddesses first, followed sometimes by cows, then to friends and family gathered. Temples and communities organize free kitchen prepared by volunteers to all those who gather. Portions of the sweet pongal dish (Sakkarai Pongal) are distributed as the prasadam in temples.
The dish and the process of its preparation is a part of the symbolism, both conceptually and materially. It celebrates the harvest and the cooking symbolizes the transformation of the gift of agriculture into nourishment for the gods and the community on a day that when the sun god is believed to start the journey north. The dish ""boiling over"" is believed to symbolically mark the blessing by Parvati. It is the ritual dish, along with many other courses prepared from seasonal foods for the gathering.

Jallikattu
The day marks a ritual visit to nearby temples where communities hold processions by parading icons from the sanctum of the temple in wooden chariots, drama-dance performances encouraging social gatherings and renewal of community bonds. Other events during Pongal include community sports and games such as Jallikattu or bull fighting. Jallikattu is a traditional event held during the period attracting huge crowds in which a bull is released into a crowd of people, and multiple human participants attempt to grab the large hump on the bull's back with both arms and hang on to it while the bull attempts to escape. Kanu Pidi is a tradition observed on Mattu Pongal by women and young girls where they place a leaf of turmeric plant outside their home, and feed pongal dish and food to the birds, particularly crow and pray for their brothers' well being. Brothers pay special tribute to their married sisters by giving gifts as affirmation of their filial love.

Contemporary practices
Pongala is celebrated in Kerala, a state that shares historic cultural overlap with Tamils through Chera dynasty according to Sangam literature. The rituals including the cooking of pongal dish, social visits, and the reverence for cattle is observed by some communities and is observed on the same day as Tamil Pongal. The celebrations include dance (Kathakali) and musical performances by boys and girls, as well as major processions featuring the temple goddess. In the Attukal Bhagavati Temple near Thiruvanathapuram, Attukal Pongala is celebrated in the month of February–March which attract large crowds.
In Karnataka, the festival days are similar, except the dish is called ""Ellu"". Decorations and social visits are also common in many parts of Karnataka. The festivities coincide with Makara Sankranthi, Maghi and Bihu celebrated across various parts of India.
In Sri Lanka, Pongal is celebrated by the Sri Lankan Tamils and the Pongal festivities last two days, essentially focused on Thai Pongal day. The custom of cooking Pukkai, a dish similar to Pongal, and made of rice and milk, is carried out on the first day.

Geography
Pongal is one of the major festivals celebrated by Tamil people across various religions in Tamil Nadu. It is also celebrated in other parts of South India, and is a major Tamil festival in Sri Lanka. It is observed by the Tamil diaspora worldwide, including those in Malaysia, Mauritius, South Africa, Singapore, United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the Gulf countries. In 2017, Delegate David Bulova introduced a joint resolution HJ573 in the Virginia House of Delegates to designate January 14 of each year as Pongal Day.

The name 'Pongala' means 'to boil over' and refers to the ritualistic offering of porridge made of rice, sweet brown molasses, coconut gratings, nuts and raisins. Generally women devotees participate in this ritual. Tamil people celebrate as Pongal.

History
The origins of the Pongala festival may date to more than 1000 years ago. Epigraphic evidence suggests the celebration of the Puthiyeedu during the Medieval Chola empire days. Puthiyeedu is believed to represent the first harvest of the year.

Attukal Bhagavathy Temple

The most famous and important among Pongala festival happens at the Attukal Bhagavathy Temple at Attukal, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala where around 3.5 million people participate. The festival in Attukal is considered by the population of the city, across their religious beliefs, as the biggest festival in the city.
Rice, coconut and jaggery are brought by women devotees along with round earthen pots for cooking. Women participating in the Pongala set up makeshift stoves using  bricks and firewood along the roads, bylanes, footpaths and shop fronts in a radius of several kilometres around the temple. They squat next to their stoves to cook the mixture of rice, jaggery and coconut in earthen pots that is offered to the goddess seeking divine blessings. The Chief Priest of the temple lights the main hearth from the divine fire inside the sanctum sanctorum. This fire is passed on from one stove to the next.
Devi is essentially the mother goddess of ancient people of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. In this part of India this concept is evolved from the deity 'Kottave' worshiped on the peak of 'Aiyramala'. During ancient times, the entire population from the nearby villages converge on this hill and they stay there during the entire festivities lasting for several days. During this time social cooking used to take place by the women which was considered to be holy and liked by the goddess. Such social cooking naturally strengthened the bonds between these villages. This custom is still continued in the form of Pongala offering. This is one side of the character of the goddess. She is also the deity who brings victory in wars and therefore the goddess is offered blood sacrifice as stated in Sangam Literature. The word used for this is 'Kuruthi'. It means killing. The Tookaam ceremonies in some temples is a reminder of the ancient practice of blood sacrifice. This custom was modified later on to give 'Kuruthi' to the deity by killing cocks, which however is not practiced now.
Although Pongala festival is celebrated on a large scale mainly in the Attukal Temple, other temples where Pongala Samarpanam (though on a significantly smaller scale) is done are the Vellayani Devi Temple, Mankulam Parasakthi Devi Temple, Kovilvila Bhagavati Temple, Karikkakom Devi Temple, Puthiyakavu Bhagavathi Temple, Kanakathur Sree Kurumbakkavu Temple, Pulpally Seetha Devi Temple, Palakunnu Bhagavathi Temple, Mulluthara Devi Temple, Chakkulathukavu Temple, Anikkattilammakshethram and Thazhoor Bhagavathy Kshetram in Kerala.
The annual Pongala festival of Attukal Bhagavathy temple, has been entered in the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest congregation of women in the world. The festival draws over 2.5 million women on a single day in March to perform the Pongala ritual, and has been a center of attraction for devotees as well as tourists who visit Trivandrum during this season.

The same day is observed elsewhere in South and South East Asia as the traditional new year, but it is known by other names such as Vishu in Kerala, and Vaisakhi or Baisakhi in central and northern India.

Puthandu is celebrated by Tamils in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, and in Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, Mauritius and Reunion. The Tamil diaspora also celebrates it  in countries such as Myanmar, South Africa, United Kingdom, United States, Canada, and Australia.

Origin and significance
The Tamil New Year follows the spring equinox and generally falls on 14 April of the Gregorian year. The day celebrates on the first day of the traditional Tamil calendar and is a public holiday in both Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka. The same date is observed as the traditional new year in Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Tripura, Bihar, Odisha, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, as well as in Nepal and Bangladesh. Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Sri Lanka also celebrate the same day as their new year, likely an influence of the shared culture between South and Southeast Asia in the 1st millennium CE.
There are several references in early Tamil literature to the April new year. Nakkirar, Sangam period author of the Neṭunalvāṭai, wrote that the sun travels from Mesha/Chittirai through 11 successive signs of the zodiac. Kūdalūr Kiḻār refers to Mesha Raasi/Chittirai as the commencement of the year in the Puṟanāṉūṟu. The Tolkaapiyam is the oldest surviving Tamil grammar that divides the year into six seasons where Chittirai marks the start of the Ilavenil season or summer.  The Silappadikaaram mentions the 12 Raasis or zodiac signs starting with Mesha/Chittirai. The Manimekalai alludes to the Hindu solar calendar as we know it today. Adiyarkunalaar, an early medieval commentator or Urai-asiriyar mentions the twelve months of the Tamil calendar with particular reference to Chittirai. There were subsequent inscriptional references in Pagan, Burma dated to the 11th century CE and in Sukhothai, Thailand dated to the 14th century CE to South Indian, often Vaishnavite, courtiers who were tasked with defining the traditional calendar that began in mid-April.

Celebration
Tamil people celebrate Puthandu, also called Puthuvarusham, as the traditional ""Tamil/New Year"", states Peter Reeves. This is the month of Chittirai, the first month of the Tamil solar calendar, and Puthandu typically falls on 14 April. In some parts of Southern Tamil Nadu, the festival is called Chittirai Vishu. On the eve of Puthandu, a tray is arranged with three fruits (mango, banana and jack fruit), betel leaves and arecanut, gold/silver jewellery, coins/money, flowers and a mirror. This is similar to the Vishu new year festival ceremonial tray in Kerala. According to the Tamil tradition, this festive tray is auspicious as the first sight upon waking on the new year day. Home entrances are decorated elaborately with colored rice powder. These designs are called kolams.

Chittirai Thiruvilha in Temples
In the temple city of Madurai, the Chittirai Thiruvilha is celebrated in the Meenakshi Temple. A huge exhibition is held, called Chittirai Porutkaatchi. On the day of the Tamil New Year, a big Car Festival is held at Tiruvidaimarudur near Kumbakonam. Festivals are also held at Tiruchirapalli, Kanchipuram and other places.

Chithiraikani in KonguNadu
Chithiraikani, also known as Vishukani, is an important part of the Puthandu celebrations in the Kongu Nadu region, which share similarities with Vishu celebrations in Kerala and Tulu Nadu.This ChithiraiKani practice involves arrangement of a special tray containing auspicious items that are displayed in front of a mirror. The word ""kani"" in Kongu Tamil and Malayalam means ""that which is seen first,"" and both celebrations involve arranging a special tray of auspicious items that are displayed in front of a mirror. The traditional belief is that viewing joyful and auspicious things first on the new year day brings prosperity and good luck.
The Chithiraikani or Vishukani tray typically includes three fruits (mango, banana, and jackfruit), betel leaves, rice, lemon, cucumber, coconut cut open, arecanut, gold or silver jewelry, coins or money, flowers, and a mirror, among other things that symbolize wealth and prosperity. This arrangement is similar to the Vishu celebrations that take place in Kerala. In some parts of Kerala, the Vishukkani tray also includes Aranmula kannadi (Vaalkannadi), golden color Konna flowers (Cassia fistula) which bloom in the season of Vishu, gold or silver jewelry, coins or money, flowers, and a mirror. The mirror symbolizes seeing oneself as a part of the abundance one sees in the form of Pani.
The day before the Chithirai Kani or Vishukkani celebrations, people prepare the tray of auspicious items. On the new year day, elders light lamps and wake up juniors in the family. As soon as they wake up, they walk to the kani with their eyes closed and see it as the first scene of the year. This tradition is significant in both regions and is believed to bring good luck and prosperity for the coming year.

Sri Lanka
Sri Lankan Tamils observe the traditional new year in April with the first financial transaction known as the Kai-vishesham. In this transaction children go to elders to pay their respect, and elders give their blessings and gift pocket money to the children in return. The event is also observed with the 'arpudu' or the first ploughing of the ground to prepare for the new agricultural cycle. The game of 'por-thenkai' or coconut wars between youth is played in villages through the Tamil north and east of the island while cart races are also held. The festive Puthandu season in April is a time for family visits and the renewal of filial bonds. It coincides with the Sinhalese new year season.

Later in the day, families enjoy a feast.

Overseas
In Malaysia and Singapore, Tamils join Sikhs, Malayalees and Bengalis to celebrate the traditional new year in mid-April with leaders across the political spectrum wishing the ethnic Indian community for the new year. Special religious events are held in Hindu temples, in Tamil community centers and Gurdwaras. Cultural programs and media events also take place. It's a day of celebration for the Indian community.

Controversy
The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)-led Government of Tamil Nadu had declared in 2008 that the Tamil new year should be celebrated on the first day of Tamil month of Thai (14 January) coinciding with the harvest festival of Pongal. The Tamil Nadu New Year (Declaration Bill 2008) was enacted as the state law by the DMK assembly members and its Tamil Nadu Government on 29 January 2008. This law of the DMK majority-led government was subsequently rescinded by a separate act of legislation in the Tamil Nadu Assembly with an AIADMK majority-led government on 23 August 2011. Many in Tamil Nadu ignored the DMK government legislation that rescheduled the festival date, and continued the celebration of their traditional Puthandu new year festival in mid-April. The Governor and Chief Minister of the Indian Union Territory of Puducherry, which has an ethnic Tamil majority, felicitated the public for the Tamil new year in April 2010. 
The legislative reach to change the traditional religious new year by the DMK government was questioned by Hindu priests and Tamil scholars. The law was met with resistance by Tamils in the state and elsewhere. It was also challenged in court. The then opposition All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) in Tamil Nadu subsequently condemned the decision of the DMK Government in that state and urged their supporters to continue celebrating the traditional date in mid-April. Tamils in Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malaysia and Canada continued to observe the new year in mid-April.
The previous state government in Tamil Nadu in an effort to placate popular sentiment announced that the same day will be celebrated as a new festival renamed as ""Chittirai Tirunal"" (the festival of Chittirai). The day remained a public holiday in Tamil Nadu under the DMK government, but not as Tamil new year, but purportedly to commemorate Dr. B.R Ambedkar, who was the Chairman of the Drafting Committee of Indian Constitution. All television channels in Tamil Nadu, including the pro-DMK Sun TV, continued to telecast festive ""Chittirai Tirunal Special Programs"" on 14 April 2010. The leader of the AIADMK, Jayalalitha refused to recognize the repackaged festival, and felicitated the Tamil people for the traditional Tamil New Year. The MDMK leader Vaiko, followed suit. The controversy between the two dates subsided, the official celebrations during the traditional new year in April revived and the public holiday was restored as the Tamil New Year.

Related festivals
Puthandu is celebrated elsewhere in India under different names commemorating the solar new year. Some examples include:

Vishu in Kerala
Vaisakhi in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, NCT of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
Pana Sankranti in Odisha
Pohela Boishakh in West Bengal and Tripura
Rongali Bihu in Assam
However, this is not the universal new year for all Hindus. New Year celebrations in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana's Ugadi & Maharashtra and Goa's Gudi Padwa, falls a few days before Puthandu. For those in Gujarat, the new year festivities coincide with the five-day Diwali festival.

South Asia and Southeast Asia
The same day every year is the new year for many Buddhist communities in parts of Southeast Asia such as Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Cambodia, likely an influence of their shared culture in the 1st millennium CE.
According to a 1957 publication by Gunasegaram, the new year celebrated in Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Champa (Vietnam) is the Tamil New Year with roots in the practices of Mohenjo-daro (Indus Valley civilization). According to Nanacuriyan, this may be from the medieval era Tamil influence in Southeast Asia.
According to Jean Michaud and other scholars, the new year celebration traditions in Southeast Asian Massif have two roots. One is China, and this influence is found for example in Vietnam. This Sino-influenced community celebrates the new year in the first or second lunar month after the winter solstice in December. The second group of people in the Massif celebrate the new year in mid April, much like most of India. This group consists of northeastern Indians, northeastern Myanmar, the Khmer in Cambodia, Tai speakers of Thailand, Laos, northern Vietnam and southern Yunnan. The festival is celebrated in the Massif in some ways unlike Puthandu. It is marked by an occasion to visit family and friends, splashing others with water (like Holi), drinking alcohol, as well as later wearing jewelry, new clothes and socializing. The new year festival is called regionally by different names:

Vaisakhi in Pakistan and Afghanistan
Bikram Samwat / Vaishak Ek in Nepal
Pohela Boishakh in Bangladesh
Aluth Avuruthu (Sinhalese New Year) in Sri Lanka 
Chol Chnam Thmey in Cambodia
Songkan / Pi Mai Lao in Laos
Songkran in Thailand
Thingyan in Myanmar

Most people who choose to observe their fast will typically break it after observing the sacred marriage performed at a temple.

Description
The Surasamharam performance is based on the legend of Murugan, also known as Kanda, as described in the Kanda Purana. In the days preceding the performance, the Kanda Purana is narrated in the temple. The performance ends with the killing of Surapadman and his allies, which is depicted through the symbolic beheading of the four asuras of Anamugan, Panumugan, Simhamugan, and Surapadman by Murugan, employing his divine spear, known as the vel. For the performance the vel is specially consecrated; during the staging of the show, it is ceremonially placed on the neck of the effigy, after which the head is removed, depicting the beheading of the asura. 
Surasamharam is preceded by several ceremonies on the last day of the Kanda Shashti festival. Special pujas are conducted and the deity of Murugan is ritually anointed in the ritual of abhishekam. Devotees are offered an auspicious sight of the deity, called a darshana. In some parts of Tamil Nadu, devotees observe a six-day fast, which they break at the end of the Surasamharam. In Palani, a procession of Murugan (locally called the Dandayuddhapani) is taken down from the Palani Murugan Temple and led through the main thoroughfares of the town before the Surasamharam.

At the Tiruchendur Murugan Temple, six days of celebrations for Kanda Shashti start from the tithi of the Aippasi month, culminate on the day of Surasamharam. The performance of the tiru kalyanam, the ceremonial wedding ceremony of the deity and his consorts, is observed on the day following the Surasamharam.
In Tamil Nadu, the Surasamharam is witnessed every year by large crowds of devotees. The state government and Indian Railways ply special buses and trains to facilitate their travel. In Kerala's Palakkad district, Surasamharam, is held in all the major Tamil settlements in the district.

It is a public holiday in Mauritius, select states in Malaysia and in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

Etymology
Thaipusam is a portmanteau of two Tamil words: Tamil month of Thai and the name of the star Pusam, denoting the day of occurrence of the festival.

Theology
According to the Kanda Puranam (the Tamil version of the Skanda Purana), three asuras (a race of celestial beings) Surapadman, Tarakasuran, and Singamukhan performed austerities to propitiate the Hindu god Shiva. Shiva granted them various boons which gave them near-immortality and the ability to conquer the three worlds. They subsequently started a reign of tyranny in their respective realms and oppressed the celestial beings including the devas and other people. The devas pleaded Shiva for his assistance to put an end to the reign of Surapadman and the asuras. In response, Shiva manifested five additional heads and a divine spark emerged from each of the six heads. Initially, the wind-god Vayu carried the sparks, but the fire-god Agni took possession of them afterwards because of the unbearable heat. Agni deposited the sparks in the Ganga river. The water in the Ganga started evaporating due to intense heat, and so the goddess Ganga took them to the Saravana lake, where each of the sparks developed into a baby boy. The six boys were raised by handmaidens known as the Kṛttikās and they were later fused into one by Parvati, thus giving rise to the six-headed Murugan. 
Parvati granted him a divine spear known as the vel. Murugan was accompanied by Virabahu who served as his commander-in-chief and eight others, who were sons bore by nine shaktis who arose from the gems of the broken anklet of Parvati, when she ran from her seat due to the heat generated by the sparks emanating from Shiva. Along with the armies of the devas, Murugan waged war on the asuras. Murugan split Surapadman into two with his vel and the two halves transformed into a mango tree and later into a peacock and a rooster. Murugan adopted the peacock as his mount and took the rooster as his flag. Thaipusam festival is celebrated to commemorate the victory of Murugan over the Surapadman.
Murugan is a deity associated with yogic discipline and austerities in Hinduism and is regarded by his adherents to be capable of offering mukti (spiritual liberation) to those who venerate him.

Occurrence
Thaipusam occurs annually and is celebrated on the full moon day in the Tamil month of Thai on the confluence of star Pusam like other festivals.

Practices
Kavadi Aattam is a ceremonial act of sacrifice and offering practiced by devotees during the Thaipusam festival. It forms a central part of the festival and symbolizes a form of debt bondage. Kavadi (meaning ""burden"" in Tamil) is a physical burden which consists of a semicircular piece of wood or steel which are bent and attached to a cross structure in its simplest form, that is balanced on the shoulders of the devotee. By bearing the Kavadi, the devotees implore Murugan for assistance, usually as a means of balancing a spiritual debt or on behalf of a loved one who is in need of help or healing. Worshipers often carry one or more pots of cow milk as an offering (pal kavadi) or other objects such as sugarcane, tender coconut, and flowers. The most extreme and spectacular practice is the carrying of Vel kavadi, a portable altar up to 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall and weighing up to 30 kg (66 lb), decorated with peacock feathers and is attached to the body of the devotee through multiple skewers and metal hooks pierced into the skin on the chest and back.
People also do a form of mortification of the flesh by piercing the skin, tongue or cheeks with vel skewers and flagellation. Since public self mutilation is prohibited by Indian law, these practices are limited in India. Vibuthi, a type of holy ash is spread across the body including the piercing sites. Drumming and chanting of verses help the devotees enter a state of trance. Devotees usually prepare for the rituals by keeping clean, doing regular prayers, following a vegetarian diet and fasting while remaining celibate. They make pilgrimage with bare feet and dance along the route while bearing these burdens.

Areas of practice

Thai pusam is a major festival in the Murugan temples including the six abodes in South India. In Dhandayuthapani Swamy Temple in Palani, the festival is celebrated over ten days known as Brahmotsavam.

He is followed by male devotees intent on fulfilling their personal promises and proving their faith. The devotees may include a minority of non-Indians and non-Hindus.

Events during the festival period
During the period of the festival, scenes from Mahabharata are enacted by the devotees and drama troupes. A week before the fire walking they perform prayers to Periyachi who is one of the most important deities of Mariamman’s entourage. The grand prayer session is held to request her blessings upon the devotees and that no unpleasant incidents should happen during the festival.
The second event is a symbolic grand marriage ceremony conducted between Arjuna and Draupadi. Following this is probably the most important ritual: a simulation of the sacrifice of Hijra, which was done before the Mahabharata war to ensure success to the Pandavas. The simulated ritual does not involve human sacrifice.
Afterwards, devotees offer their prayers like carrying milk pots, doing Kumbiduthandam (prostrating after every step) and Angapirathatchanam (rolling around the temple grounds).  Mariamman is given a milk bath with the milk that the devotees brought as it is a belief that the sins of man will be washed away.
Two days before the Tīmiti festival, a silver chariot procession takes place to commemorate the 18-day battle which culminates in the Pandavas victory. At this juncture, Krishna agreed to be Arjuna's charioteer. Marking this occasion in Singapore, on the Friday and Saturday prior to Tīmiti, a chariot procession takes place around the Telok Blangah and Bukit Merah districts.
The fire pit is prepared the night before the final day and kept red hot throughout the ritual. Devotees begin their ritual as early as 4 am and the event ends before 11am. It is believed that if they are truly devoted to Draupadi they will walk through the fire unscathed.
Some devotees suffer burn injuries on their feet. Injuries to children subjected to such rituals in Tamil Nadu have been reported. Reportedly due to unsteadiness while walking, children fall and often sustain injuries to other parts of their bodies besides their feet. However, studies have found that the prolonged suffering involved in this and similar rituals can result in feelings of euphoria for participants, an effect similar to the marathon ""runners high"".

Manappakam Kanni Amman Kovil
The Kanni Amman Kovil temple located in Manappakkam a village near Chengalpattu, Tamilnadu, India is believed to be celebrating thimidhi thiruvizha more than 2000 years. More than 5000 people do thimidhi and many people do tonsuring (fully shaven head), earpiercing, make Pongal, Kadavettu (Goat-cutting) in front of the temple as offering to the Goddess Arulmigu Kanni Amman and celebrate the festival.

As the story goes Shesha, the divine bed serpent of Vishnu, or Patanjali, along with the flower devotee sage of Shiva, named Vyaghrapada, wanted to see the cosmic dance of Shiva, and thus performed severe penance for many days at Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram. Pleased by their devotion, ultimately, Shiva appeared before them to perform his dance of bliss or cosmic dance, as also granted the sage a boon to have tiger legs, so that he could pick flowers in the morning, to offer to Shiva, without being stung by the bees.

Origin
It takes place on the full moon night in the Tamil month of Margazhi (December–January) and this is also the longest night in a year. Literary and historical evidence in the form of stone inscriptions state that the festival has been celebrated on this day for more than 1500 years. Shiva is praised in Tamil by many names, one of them is Athiraiyan, from Thiruvathirai (Thiru + Athirai).
Tamil hymns of Manikkavasakar's Tiruvacakam (particularly the hymns Tiruvempavai and Tiruppallieluchi) are chanted in temples. On the very day of Thiruvathirai the idols of Nataraja (Shiva) and his consort Shivagami (Parvati) are taken out of the temple premises for a grand procession. It is one of the major events in almost all the Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu.
Sambandar sung in Tevaram during 7th-9th century, how Thiruvathirai celebrated at Kapaleeshwaram (present day Mylapore, Chennai).
Appar wrote a separate pathigam (10 songs) in Tevaram, in the name Thiruvathirai Pathigam which describes the importance and celebrations of Thiruvathirai.
In 4th Tirumurai he sang about the celebration in Tiruvarur
The cosmic dance of Shiva represents five activities – Creation, Protection, Destruction, Embodiment and Release. In essence, it represents the continuous cycle of creation and destruction. This cosmic dance takes place in every particle and is the source of all energy. Arudra Darshan celebrates this ecstatic dance of Shiva.
It is essentially a Shaivite festival and celebrates the cosmic dance of Shiva, which is represented by the Nataraja form. Arudhra (Thiruvathirai in Tamil) signifies the golden red flame and Shiva performs the dance in the form this red-flamed light. Shiva is supposed to be incarnated in the form of Nataraja during the Arudra Darshan day.
Most of the temples around the world with Nataraja and Shiva as deity perform the Arudhra Darshan. Neivedhyam (food for God) made for Nataraja on that day is Thiruvathirai Kali.
The festival is celebrated by Sri Lankan Tamils at Thinnapuram Sundareswarar Temple, it is called Elatu Chidambaram.
As there is no date for Arudra Darshan in 2022, it will be celebrated twice in 2023, which is a common occurrence for same.

Significance in Tamil Nadu
In Tamil Nadu, mainly in the Kongunadu region, the married women will fast during the day time. They will take food before sunrise and start their fasting (called Thiruvempavai Nonbu). They will break the fast after witnessing the moon rise. Nonbu (fasting) starts nine days before and ends on Thiruvathirai day so totally they fast for ten days.
There is special food called Thiruvadhirai kali made of Rice, Jaggery, Moong dhall, Coconut, Cardamom and Ghee with Thiruvathirai elu curry koottu, which is made out of seven vegetables, that is cooked and served on this day.

The cosmic dance of Shiva is enacted on the day.

Significance in Kerala
Thiruvathira is the nakshatra or ""star"" of Shiva as per the Malayalam calendar. It is believed that on this day, the Goddess Parvathi finally met Shiva after her long penance and Shiva took
her as a saha-dharma chaarini (equal partner). Both Parvathi and Shiva present this ideal to devotees in the form of Ardhanarishvara (half male, half female form). Another belief is that the festival commemorates the death of Kamadeva, the Hindu god of erotic desire.
In Kerala, Thiruvathira is an important traditional festival along with the other popular festivals, Onam and Vishu. This has been celebrated by Malayali women. It is largely a festival for women; unmarried women observe a partial fast on this day to get good husbands and married women take a fast from the preceding day (Makayiram nakshatra) and on the day of Thiruvathira for the well-being of their husband and family. The first Thiruvathira of a newly wedded woman is her poothiruvathira.

 
The fast essentially involves abstaining from rice-based food. The typical meal includes cooked broken wheat and Thiruvathira pulukku, a mix of tuber vegetables: colocasia, yam, Chinese potato, sweet potato with long beans and raw plantain fruit, cooked with a thick paste of freshly ground coconut. The dessert is called koova payasam, a sweet dish made of arrow root powder, jaggery and coconut milk.
Thiruvathirakali is a dance form performed by women on the day of Thiruvathira to the accompaniment of Thiruvathira paattu, folk songs telling tales of lovesick Parvati, her longing and penance for Shiva's affection and Shiva's might and power. The sinuous movements executed by the group of dancers around a nilavilakku embody lasya or the amorous charm and grace of the feminine. The dance follows a circular, pirouetting pattern accompanied by clapping of the hands and singing. Today, Thiruvathirakali has become a popular dance form for all seasons. Thiruvathira kali is a typical dance form of Kerala. This is a female group dance made up of simple yet very attractive steps. In ancient times, women use to perform this dance in their homes during festivals and functions, giving it the Malayalam name aka Kaikottikali: aka-inside + kaikottikali-play clapping hands. Lore has it that Thiruvathira Kali is in memory of Shiva taking Parvati as his wife. A group of women dressed in typical Kerala style with mundu and neriyathu and the hair bun adorned with jasmine garlands perform this dance during festival seasons. Kaikottikkali spreads the message of joy and also illustrates the emotions of a married woman towards her beloved and of the unmarried woman longing for one. Thiruvathira is also known as the Kerala's own version of Karva Chauth.

Following the independence and partition of what had been British India in August 1947, the acting ruler of the State of Tripura, the regent Kanchan Prava Devi, did not accede to the new Union of India, and this began an organized movement in the state called the Mukti Parishad, the aim of which was to end the rule of the Maharajahs of Tripura and establish democracy instead. In 1948 the leader of this movement, Desharrath Debbarma, used the occasion of the Ganga puja to raise funds by charging ₹ 1 from each family for the Mukti Parishad. However, the activities of his movement were put down, it became less and less active, and in 1950 it finally merged with the Communist Party. In the meantime, Tripura had acceded to the new India in October 1949.

This festival is celebrated at Agartala (Puran Agartala) in the temple premises of Fourteen gods. There are many legends associated with this Puja. The celebrations extend until a week and are held in the temple premises which are attended by thousands of people.

Name
The word ""Kharchi"" is derived from the word ""Khya"" which means ""Earth"". Kharchi Puja is basically done to worship the earth. All of rituals are of tribal origin, which includes worshipping fourteen gods and Mother Earth. The Puja is performed to wash out the sins and to clean the post-menstrual phase of Mother Earth's menstruation. Thus the Puja is performed for seven consecutive days. On the day of the Puja, the fourteen gods are carried to river ""Saidra"" by the members of ""Chantai"". The gods are bathed in the holy water and are brought back to the temple. They are again placed in the temple by performing Puja, offering of Flowers and Vermillion. Animal sacrifice is also an important part of this festival and includes sacrificing of Goats and Pigeons. People offer sweets and the sacrificial meat to god. Both tribal and non-tribal people join and celebrate the festival in a festive mood by becoming a part of it. Plenty of other attractions along with a large fair and cultural programs are organized during this time.

Timing and mythological background
Kharchi puja is performed after 15 days of ""Ama Pechi"". According to Tripuri legends, ""Ama Pechi"" is the Menstruation of the mother goddess, or Earth mother, and the soil is neither ploughed nor dug anywhere during this time. Among Tripuri people menstruation is considered unholy and all significant functions by women are prohibited. The Earth is therefore considered unclean after the menstruation of the earth mother during ""Ama Pechi"". The Kharchi puja is performed to wash out the Post-Menstrual uncleanliness of the Earth mother's Menstruation.

Activities
Kharchi puja lasts for seven consecutive days. The festival is held at the temple of fourteen gods at Old Agartala. On the day of puja, the fourteen deities are carried by chanting members and taken to the river Saidra, bathed in the holy water, and then returned to the temple. The deities are then decorated with various flowers and vermillion is placed on each deity's forehead.
Every day large numbers of people attend the festival and both Tripuri and Non-Tripuri participants. People offer different types of Prasāda i.e., Offerings like Goat, Buffalo, Sweets, etc.. Various cultural programmes are performed each evening and a large fair is organised to mark the occasion. People look to their own welfare as well as the welfare of the society and the state in general. 
The Last Kharcha Puja was held on 10 July 2019.

Interpretations of meaning
Elangbam Nilakanta Singh translates Lai Haraoba as the “merry making of the gods and goddesses,” and many others use this meaning. Saroj Nalini Parratt and John Parratt translate it as “pleasing of the gods,” based on J. Shakespeare’s (1913) translation, but they make it plural because the festival honors more than one god. Practitioners of the ritual say that the name comes from the ""lai hoi laoba,"" the cry of ‘hoi’, in the Meitei creation myth, which marks the moment the universe is revealed. This idea is given by Ng. Kulachandra, the former head of the Manipur Pandit Loishang.

Origin
Lai Haraoba (Meitei: ꯂꯥꯏ ꯍꯔꯥꯎꯕ) is a ritualistic festival of the Meiteis observed since ancient times. It is a ritual enactment of the creation myth. It mirrors the entire culture of Manipur and depicts the close affinities between the hill and plain people. It is a combination of religious recitations, traditional music and dance, traditional social values and ancient cultural aspects.
The rituals within the festival are the same except in some items or hymns, such as ikouba, ikourol, and yakairol at the beginning and mikon thagonba, ngaprum tanba at the end of the festival. In the performances, the evolution story with the amorous love-affairs of Nongpok Ninghthou and Panthoibi is depicted and played equally in all kinds of lai haraoba. According to folklore, the gods held the first Lai Haraoba  on the Koubru Hill so that their descendants would imitate them by performing the same rites.

Places and timings
Lai Haraoba takes place at local shrines dedicated to the Umang Lai deities, which are important to the traditional Meitei religion. The festival doesn't have fixed dates but happens between February and May or June. Each shrine chooses its own dates for the festival. The festival can last from three days to over a month, depending on the shrine. The dates and length of the festival can be different for each shrine.

Deities
The Lai Haraoba is also called the Umang Lai Haraoba, named after the Umang Lai deities, honored during the festival. These deities are seen as protectors of the areas where the shrines are located. The festival takes place at these shrines, and the whole community helps with the preparations.
The Umang Lai group includes over 300 deities, such as ancestors, legendary forefathers, and other important gods in the traditional Meitei religion (Sanamahism).

Male and female aspects
The rituals of Lai Haraoba honor a male and a female deity, called Lainingthou and Lairembi/Lairemma. The rituals focus on creation. The Meitei people believe that the supreme god created the cosmos. He is called Tengbanba Mapu or Taibangpanba Mapu or Atiya Sidaba. Some creation stories start with these gods, while others go back to Atingkok and Amamba. Amamba is the dark place where life begins.

Types and variations
Four types of Lai Haraoba are prevalent in the Meitei society, namely, Kanglei Haraoba, Moirang Haraoba, Kakching Haraoba and Chakpa Haraoba. Kanglei Haraoba is performed mainly in Imphal and the nearby towns. Moirang Haraoba is only in Moirang, Kakching Haraoba is held in Kakching and Chakpa Haraoba is celebrated at Andro, Phayeng, Sekmai, Koutruk, Khuukhul, Leimaram and Tairenpokpi.

Kanglei Haraoba
One type of Lai Haraoba is Kanglei Haraoba, celebrated in and around Imphal. The name Kanglei comes from Kangla, which is in the center of Imphal. The main deity worshipped is Pakhangba. A special part of this festival is when Khoriphaba, a deity, looks for a ‘bride’. A maibi (spirit medium) calls on Khoriphaba's spirit to choose the bride. The festival ends with the nongarol, which shows the rise of the divine presence.

Moirang Haraoba
Moirang Haraoba is celebrated in and around the Moirang region in the southern part of the Imphal valley. The main deity worshipped is Thangching (Thangjing). In this version, along with langthrei leaves (a common offering in the Kanglei version), leisang, another evergreen plant, is also offered. A special part of this festival is the Khamba Thoibi classical dance. The festival ends with tengtharol (a song of lamentation), which marks the rise of the deities.

Chakpa Haraoba
Chakpa Haraoba is not a separate type of the festival, but a group of versions celebrated by Chakpa groups in different villages. The hand movements are simpler, and the structure is less complex. It includes sacrificial practices. The main versions are from Andro, Imphal East and Phayeng villages. In Andro, a special ritual called Numit Kappa (shooting of the sun) is performed, which is unique to them. The Phayeng tradition has special rituals, like ""Lai Phagi Tounaba,"" which are not done in other places.

Kakching Haraoba
Kakching Haraoba is celebrated in the Kakching region, east of Imphal. A special part of the festival is the ""Ngaprum Tanba"" ritual (hunting of eel) on the last day. People have different opinions on whether it should be a separate type of festival. Some think it should be part of Kanglei, while others think it should be under Chakpa Haraoba. Dr. Kh. Ratankumar Singh sees it as a separate type. However, each shrine often has its own unique practices.

Rituals
The Lai Haraoba rituals are led by special people. There are three old traditions. The three traditions are maiba, maibi, and asheiba (pena (musical instrument) is about the music with a special fiddle). Only men can follow maiba and asheiba. Only women can follow maibi, which is about connecting with spirits.
The Lai Haraoba rituals are detailed and cover many parts. They can be divided into three parts. These parts are the beginning, the middle, and the end. The parts are called Lai Eekouba, Haraoba, and Lairoi respectively. The Lai Eekouba marks the descent of the god (Lai in Meitei language). The Lairoi marks the ascent. The days in between follow a similar pattern. The number of days in between can change. This makes the festival last anywhere from three days to over three weeks.

Lai Eekouba
The Lai Eekouba rituals focus on bringing a sacred presence into the shrine for the festival. Before the rituals, the doors of the shrine, which are usually closed all year, are opened. This is called ""lai thong hangba,"" meaning ""opening of the shrine doors."" It happens on a lucky day before the Eekouba rituals. After opening, the shrine is cleaned, and sacred images and objects are prepared. The utensils are cleaned, clothes for the ceremonies are washed, and the sacred images are taken out. Sometimes, preparations begin even before opening the shrine, like making rice beer for the event. This process is done with special songs and rituals.
In the Eekouba ritual, the sacred presence is brought through water. This is done at a pond or river. A procession goes from the shrine to the water. There, offerings are made and deities are called. A maibi performs the ritual by chanting and ringing bells. The maibi may go into a trance and speak messages from the spirits. The sacred objects come to life during this time. Afterward, the procession returns to the shrine, and the objects are placed in their spots. The day ends with the pena (musical instrument) fiddle player, who plays music and sings to rest the deities for the night, with a rite called ""naosumba"". This is the first day of the festival.

Haraoba
The second day starts with the awakening rite (yakeiba). The pena fiddle player plays in the morning to wake up the deity. Some rituals are done, like bathing (iru sadengba) and removing bad energies (anam-aha kokpa). People bring fruits, rice, grains, flowers, incense, and candles as offerings. The morning prayers are recited, and the offerings are given.
The main ritual happens in the evening. Music and dance are an important part of it. They are not just for performance, but part of the ritual. The evening starts with offering flowers, called ""Lei Langba."" The person in charge of the flowers or their helper does this. The maibis show respect before starting the dance of Thougal Jagoi. This dance is a way to honor the Lai and get ready for the day’s work. The songs in the dance praise the deity. The maibis lead the dance, and everyone in the community can join. After the dance, the Laibou part of the ritual starts.

Laibou
The laibou rituals are the main part of the Lai Haraoba. Before this, a banana leaf with a small offering and sacred langthrei leaves are placed in the center of the area. The maibis then dance to bring the sacred presence into the space. This dance is called Laiching Jagoi, or ""the dance to draw out the deities."" The dance is accompanied only by the sound of the pena (musical instrument) fiddle, with no singing. After the dance, everyone shouts ""hoi"" together in a song called hoi laoba. They follow the maiba’s lead. The singing style is similar to the closing song, wakol laoba, but it is different from other ritual songs. This singing style is called ""antiphonal songs,"" which is different from other ritual songs.
The laibou rituals are performed in a procession that goes around the performance area. The rituals symbolize the creation of the human body, birth, building a house, farming, and weaving. The procession, led by the maibi, starts in front of the shrine and moves around the area, showing respect to the four directions and their deities.
The dance begins with the creation of the body. The maibi dances to show how each part of the body is made, like carving the eyes, drawing the brows, and marking the soles of the feet. Then, the baby is 'born' and cared for. As the child grows, clothing is needed. To make clothes, the hillside is cleared to grow cotton, which is then processed and woven. To protect the child, a house is built, with frames made and mud used to plaster the walls. When the child grows older, they go fishing, which symbolizes physical desires. Throughout this ritual, there are clear references to everyday life and culture.

After Laibou
After the Laibou, the Padon Jagoi follows. In this, the maibis form a line, led by a senior maibi, and dance in a serpentine pattern in the performance area. Next, a series of rites takes place, focusing on the phibul (a ball of cloth) and the phijang, which is a piece of white cloth held by four poles. These four poles form a ritual umbrella and banners. The four corners of the cloth are held by the poles. Two maibis, each holding a sacred object, dance around the poles, moving under the cloth. After the rites, the cloth is gathered up and returned to the shrine. It is sometimes called as a part of the ritual ""canopy cycle.""
The day ends with the participants drawing serpentine patterns, called ""Lairen Mathek Chatpa."" Then, the sacred objects are put back in the shrine, and the Wakol song is sung. The deities are put to rest with a lullaby called Naosumba, played by the pena.

Special rites
Some rites are done only on certain days. One is the ""Saroi Khangba,"" where food is offered to lesser spirits. Another is the ""Kanglei Thokpa,"" where the spirit of the deity Khoriphaba is called. This is also known as ""Lai Nupi Thiba,"" meaning ""search for the bride."" A more visible rite is the ""Lai Lam-thokpa"" street procession, where the procession moves outside with a big celebration and many people.

Lairoi
The Lairoi rituals happen on the last day and mark the end of the festival. These rituals focus on closing the sacred time and space of Lai Haraoba. One ritual is ""Thang Jagoi,"" a dance with blades, performed by a maibi at the four corners to remove bad energies. Another ritual is Loutaba, also called Tangkhul-Nurabi, which is about two important mythological figures. Loutaba is like a skit with comedy, myths, chants, and some improvisation. Other closing rituals include Ougri Hangel, Thawai Mi-konba, Sharit Litpa, and Khencho Chongba.
The sacred presence is let go with the Lai Nongaba rite, marking its departure and return to the other realm. A boat is made for this journey. The Uyarol songs describe the tree being cut down, and the Hijing Hirao songs describe making the boat. The ascent is marked by the Higa Ishei hymn, and the ritual ends with the Nongarol hymn.
When returning to the shrine, the sacred images and items used in the ritual are taken apart, all on the same night. A Leihun offering of langthrei leaves is made, and the shrine doors are closed for five days. On the fifth day, the maibi comes back to remove the offering and prepare a new one. This final rite, called Leihun Tamba, ends the Lairoi rituals.

Lai Haraoba Ishei
Lai Haraoba Ishei is a famous folk song played mainly during Lai Haraoba. This song contains lyrics with veiled references to erotic mysticism. The main quality of the song is the rhythm in its tune.

Sports
In Lai Haraoba, the day after the Lairoi (last day of rituals) was for sports events. These events included many traditional Meitei games and sports. Some of the games were Yubi Lakpi, which is a traditional Meitei rugby and uses an oiled slippery coconut and oiled bodies. Another game was Khong Kangjei, which is a traditional Meitei hockey. Mukna is a traditional Meitei wrestling, and mukna-kangjei is a mix of wrestling and hockey. Thouri Chingnaba is a traditional Meitei tug of war.

Influences on other performing arts
Dance forms of Lai Haraoba helped create the Manipuri dance style and inspired the Manipuri Ras Lila, one of India's classical dances. The focus on dance has shaped how people see and talk about Lai Haraoba, both in Manipur and outside. But Lai Haraoba is more than just dance, music, or religion. It is an important part of the culture and has helped the Meitei people strengthen their identity, especially in relation to Hindu culture. The festival and its traditions show the Meitei view of the world and their values. It also reflects their material culture.

Every year, during the period of Holi, thousands of devotees and tourists visit these towns to celebrate the festival. The festivities usually last for more than a week and ends on Rang Panchami.

Origins
Associated with legend that is linked to the divine couple Radha Krishna, the festival seeks to recreate it. According to the legend, Lord Krishna who was resident of Nandgaon and considered as the son-in-law of Vrishabhanu wanted to spray the colors on his beloved Radha and her friends. But, as Krishna and his friends entered Barsana, they were playfully greeted with the sticks by Radha and her friends who drove them out of Barsana. Following the same trend, every year on the occasion of Holi, the men of Nandagaon who are treated as son-in-laws of Barsana visit Barsana and are greeted by women with colors and sticks (aka lathi). The celebration is enacted in perfect good humor by both the sides, men of Nandgaon and women of Barsana.

. The area is given a major facelift befitting the venue for the divine marriage.

History
The history of Ram Barat is said to go back around 125 years, when Lala Kokamal, a reputed business man, started the tradition of three days of festivities, revolving around the royal wedding. His influence has been so great on this festival that the road from where the Baraat proceeds has been named 'Lala Kokamal Marg', and the grounds where Ram Lila is held are named after Lala Kokamal. When he died in 1966, his son Radharaman took charge as secretary of Ramlila until his death in 1978. Until their deaths in 2016, his youngest son Raj Narain was the treasurer of Ramlila and his Grandson Hari Kishan Agarwal was the Vice President of this prestigious society. Now Lala Kokamal's Great Grandson Rajeev K Agarwal has also started devoting his time to the event by mainly supporting the fundraising activities.

In 2008, the Ram Barat was held in the Kamla Nagar area.
In 2010, it was held in the Balkeshwar area.
In 2013, Janakpuri was celebrated in the Kamla Nagar Agra.
In 2015, Janakpuri was celebrated from 8-10 October in the Gandhi Nagar locality.
In 2018, Janakpuri was celebrated from 7-10 October in the Vijay Nagar locality.

Preparations
Preparation for the event begin well in advance and the best craftsmen from the country are invited to set up the Janak Mahal and other elaborate structures. The locality selected for Ram Barat is given special funding and is decorated like a bride's paternal home, ready to receive the Baraatis (Shri Ram and his family entourage).

Festivities
The festivities last for three days. On the first day, marriage procession is undertaken. This is watched by millions of people throughout Agra as well as those arriving from neighbouring  districts of Rajasthan & Madhya Pradesh. The area is lit up with thousands of lights and there is non-stop music, and the cinema theatres run film shows throughout the night to accommodate the migratory crowd. These three days can be seen as a large carnival where people from all walks of life come together to have a great time.

Harela means ""Day of Green"", and Agriculture-based communities in the region consider it highly auspicious, as it marks the beginning of the sowing cycle in their fields. Multiple Kauthigs/Thols/Melas (Fairs) are also organized at this festival.

Belief
The primary belief of this festival lies in the probable origins of Neo-lithic fertility festivals, which were marked as the religious celebration of the wedding of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati,

Significance and Celebration in Kumaon
Harela has a great significance in Kumaon. This symbolizes a new harvest and the rainy season. It has become a common practice to attribute the slogan of – ""Save The Environment"" to Harela. Schools in Uttarakhand often encourage their students to plant saplings either at home, school or with the support of local officials.
In Kumaun, the two celebrations during Navrati – first during Chaitra Navrati in the month of Chaitra, and second during Sharad Navratri in the month of Ashwin, is also considered to be connected to Harela. This is followed by Bhaitauli or Bhitauli wherein gifts are given to girls of the family. The Shravan Harela is celebrated as the first day (Kark Sankranti) of the Hindu calendar month of Shravan (late July). Ten days before the due date, 5 or 7 types of seeds are sown in buckets by the head of every family. Water is then sprinkled over them. After the due time, but before the actual celebration, a mock wedding is done by young ones. This is followed by people worshiping the statues of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. It is also marked by playing 'Gedi'. It is a game where small children mount on bamboo sticks and walk around farms. The harvested herbs (also called by the same name, harela) are taken as God's blessings. Elders of the home put harela on the heads of others, touching the harela from their head to feet. A blessing verse is also chanted while putting harela. This is the symbol for the rainy season and the new harvest. People also eat the seeds of the new harvest after heating them. People meet their relatives, and enjoy the festival. Some people also sow the seeds of new plants in the soil or fields and join their hands in the form of 'Pranam' for saving the environment. 
People make clay statues of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati known as Dikare or Dikars, and worship them. Harela symbolizes the new harvest of the rainy season every year.

Traditions of Harela festival in Kumaun -
On the day of Harela, Pandit ji does the Pranpratishtha of Harela in Devasthanam. Dishes are prepared for the Harela festival. It is necessary to make urad pakoras on any auspicious occasion or festival in the mountains. On the day of Harela festival ,plants are planted with a vow to protect nature. Out of the cut greenery, two bundles or some parts are kept at the topmost point of the roof, which is called the axis.
After this it ascends to the family deities and all the temples in the village. Along with this, the elders in the house apply Harela to the younger ones with the best wishes of Harela. In the village or in kinship, newborn children are specially sent to the festival of Harela.Here in Shoka tribal rural areas, a symbolic marriage is also organized with a sprig of greenery (a special plant). In some areas of Almora, newly married couples take fruits and vegetables to the girl's maternal home, which is called the tradition of giving Og. Traditions of Harela festival

Significance in Garhwal and Himachal-Pradesh
In Garhwal and Himachal, people take their village deity to an open place, and sing and dance in front of the idol. Since deities mostly do not travel during monsoon, all the Dev-Dolis return to their Mool-Gram before the onset of Monsoon, which is followed by some celebration.
In Garhwal, there is a tradition of planting saplings/plants on this day, either by an individual, a family, or by the community. 
It is usually celebrated on 16 July as it is the beginning or the first day of Shravan Maas (rainy season)

It is one of the most important festivals for the Kumauni people as it signifies not only the victory of good over evil but also end of the winter season and the start of the new sowing season which holds great importance for this agricultural community of the North Indian Himalayas. It is an amalgamation of the cultural traditions of North India and the local traditions of Kumaon.
The uniqueness of the Kumaoni Holi lies in its being a musical affair, whatever its form, be it the Baithki Holi, the Khari Holi and the Mahila Holi all of which start from Basant Panchmi. 
This results in the festivities of Holi lasting for almost two months in Kumaon. The Baithki Holi and Khari Holi are unique in that the songs on which they are based have a combination of melody, fun, and spiritualism. These songs are essentially based on classical ragas. Baithki Holi is also known as Nirvan Ki Holi or Holi of Salvation.
Kumauni Holi has characteristics which are very different from Holi celebrations anywhere in the country.","Kumauni or Kumaoni Holi is the historical and cultural celebration of the Hindu festival of Holi in the region of Kumaon, India. It is one of the most important festivals for the Kumauni people as it signifies not only the victory of good over evil but also end of the winter season and the start of the new sowing season which holds great importance for this agricultural community of the North Indian Himalayas. It is an amalgamation of the cultural traditions of North India and the local traditions of Kumaon.
The uniqueness of the Kumaoni Holi lies in its being a musical affair, whatever its form, be it the Baithki Holi, the Khari Holi and the Mahila Holi all of which start from Basant Panchmi. 
This results in the festivities of Holi lasting for almost two months in Kumaon. The Baithki Holi and Khari Holi are unique in that the songs on which they are based have a combination of melody, fun, and spiritualism. These songs are essentially based on classical ragas. Baithki Holi is also known as Nirvan Ki Holi or Holi of Salvation.
Kumauni Holi has characteristics which are very different from Holi celebrations anywhere in the country.

Forms of Holi
The following are the various forms musical gatherings in which Holi songs are ceremonially sung which are viewed as the start of the Holi celebration. All of these celebrations in the form of musical gatherings start on the Basant Panchmi Day.

Origins
The Origin of the forms of Holi especially Baithaki Holi musical traditions are in 15th century Champawat (court of the Chand kings) where the musical traditions of Braj mixed with Kumaoni musical traditions of Khadi Holi Of Champawat (Sui, Gumdesh, bilde & bishung) The Ustads which came from the plains (places like Rampur ) made the singing of Holi famous & loved  not just among the rulers but also with the common masses,  who slowly adopted it and gave it a distinctive Kumauni flavour. A style which is a unique blend of  classical music and folk. While, to some it might resemble Thumri because of the presence of Shringar Ras in it but it is totally different, the way the Bandish are rendered, elaborated and the way some of the Raags are presented. With the spread of Chand rule and integration of Kumaon under them the Holi traditions spread all across Kumaon and acquired their distinct Kumaoni flavour. Mr. Heera Ballabh Bhatt ji was the famous Khadi Holi and Baithaki Holi singer in Champawat. He represented Kumaoni Khadi Holi on DD1.

Baithaki Holi
Baithki Holi (बैठकी होली), (literally Sitting Holi) is a form of musical gathering starting from the day of Basant Panchmi held all across Kumaon till the Dulhendi (or the last full moon day of the lunar month Phalguna). In some areas of Kumaon it starts even earlier at the peak of winter on the first Sunday of the Indian month of Paush that is in the month of December and they celebrates baithaki holi till March (4 months) and during baithaki holi they do not use colours to celebrate.
The Baithaki Holi songs are based on the classical traditions of Hindustani Classical Music but have heavy influence of Kumaoni folk music traditions.
The Baithki Holi begins from the premises of temples, where Holiyars (होल्यार), (the singers of Holi songs) as also the people gather to sing songs to the accompaniment of classical music like harmonium and tabla. Generally starting from  the first Sunday of Paush these are known as Nirvana Holi.  Some of the holi's written by Swami Brahmanand are also sung  and are called Brahmanand ki holi. From Shivratri the focus then Shifts to Shivpadi Holi's.
Most famous Baithaki Holi groups lives in Pati, Champawat district. And there is at least one musical player in all families. They sings their own made baithaki holi songs in regional Kumaoni language or Hindi language.
Kumaonis are very particular about the time when the songs based on ragas should be sung. For instance, at noon the songs based on Pilu, Bhimpalasi and Sarang ragas are sung while evening is reserved for the songs based on the ragas like Kalyan, Shyamkalyan, Kafi,  Jaijawanti etc.
There is a certain distinctiveness in the presentation of ragas (melodies) too and some of them like Janglakafi (which is a special ang of khamaj) are unique to kumauni holi 
The Taal's used are also unique. Dhamaar taal in kumauni holi has 16 matra's rather than 14 as in Indian classical music tradition. The other most widely used taal is known as Chanchar which also has 16 matra's. Other than these Teental and keharwa are widely used & at times one may also find Dadra being used but in most common case it is Chanchar -Teental -Keharwa in a Sitarkhani gat. 
The Baithaks or sittings are held in the local community centres and even at local homes. It generally starts with Rag Dhamaar and ends with Rag Bhairavi.
The songs are usually religious in nature and concern tales from the life of the Hindu God Krishna and Ram . Still these Baithaks are an inter-religious affair as even Muslims and Christians participate in these gatherings.

Khadi Holi
Khadi Holi (खड़ी होली), (literally Standing Holi) usually starts along with but sometimes a little later than Baithaki Holi.
It is mostly celebrated in the rural areas of Kumaon. The songs of the Khari Holi are sung by the people, sporting traditional white nokdaar topi,  churidar payajama and kurta, dance in groups to the tune of ethnic musical instruments like the dhol, joda (metal instrument), and Hurka.
Men in groups singing Khadi holi songs which are much more Kumaoni in flavour than the classical renditions of the Baithaki holi visit different homes and greet the members of that house and chant hymns praying for prosperity of the householder. These groups of men are called tolis.
Khadi Holi is filled with excitement and frolic in contrast to the more sombre nature of the  Baithaki Holi.

Mahila Holi
Mahila Holi gatherings are similar to those of Baithaki but composed exclusively of women.

Rituals
Cheer Bandhan and Cheer Dahan
The Holika bonfire in Kumaun is known as cheer (चीर) which is made in a ceremony known as Cheer Bandhan (चीर बंधन) fifteen days before Dulhendi.  The cheer is basically a bonfire with a green paiya tree branch in the middle. The cheer of every village and mohalla is rigorously guarded as rival mohallas try to steal the others' cheer. The cheer is the centre of the festivities.
The Cheer is burnt on the night before Holi and is known as Cheer Dahan is symbolic of the victory of the pious Prahlad over his evil father's plans.

Chharadi
Dulhendi known as chharadi (छरड़ी), in Kumaoni (from chharad (छरड़), or natural colours made from flower extracts, ash and water) is celebrated with great gusto much in the same way as all across North India. Principal ingredients of the celebration are Abeer and Gulal, in all possible colours. Next comes squirting of coloured water using pichkaris. Coloured water is prepared using Tesu flowers, which are first gathered from the trees, dried in the sun, and then ground up, and later mixed with water to produce orange-yellow coloured water. Another traditional Holi item now rarely seen is a red powder enclosed in globes of Lakh, which break instantly and cover the party with the powder.

Shubh Kamna
The culmination of the holi celebrations takes place with throwing abeer and gulal in the air and reciting out aloud in unison the following prayer in Kumaoni for a healthy and prosperous year ahead.
हो हो हो लख रे (may you live a hundred thousand years)
हमार आमा बुबू जी रौला सौ लाख बरिस (may our grandparents live for a hundred thousand years)
हमार इजा बौजू जी रौला सौ लाख बरिस (may our parents live for a hundred thousand years)
हमार दाज्यू भौजी जी रौला सौ लाख बरिस (may our brothers and their families live for a hundred thousand years)
हो हो हो लख रे (may you live a hundred thousand years)

Cuisine
Special culinary preparations for Holi include gujia (fried dumpling filled with a sweet filling of roasted Mava(Solid milk extract), and dry fruits and nuts) and Aaloo ke Gutke (आलू के गुटके), which is fried boiled potatoes seasoned with Dhania patta (Coriander leaves) with local spices and Bhaang ki Chutney.

Significance
Apart from its symbolic significance of victory of pious Prahlad over his evil father  Hiranyakashipu's plans. In Kumaon holi also signifies the end of the long Himalayan winter and the beginning of a new sowing season which is to be celebrated it also means a break from the rigorous life of hard agricultural labour for a few days for the Kumaoni peasantry.

Nanda Devi's worship in Garhwal and the history of the Raj-Jaat
Initially when the Raj-Jaat started in the a small Hamlet of Chamoli Garhwal, it was a much smaller affair compared to the scale of today's events. The main families associated with the Raj-Jaat are the royal family of Kansua (Kansua ka Kunwar) and the Nautiyals of Nauti village, otherwise known as Gurujis as only they had the right to be the Royal priests and advisers. The eleven remaining clans of Barathogi-Baman (Nautiyals being one of them) got associated quickly after that. Barathogi-Baman are the twelve chief (Thokdar) Brahmin families from their twelve native villages. When more help was required to manage the crowd and the activities, neighbouring clans from Rawat and Negi communities were engaged and they too got associated with the Raj-Jaat.
The whole Yatra signifies the journey of the newly wed Nanda Devi (Gora is also used very commonly and interchangeably), leaving her maternal home and going to Kailash. Officially, as per the traditions, the goddess visits her maternal family after every twelve years, and then after weeks of celebrations she goes back to Kailash. So as per the local Garhwali customs, everyone visits her before she leaves, and she is presented with lots of gifts. A number of deities from neighbouring areas pay her a visit, and she visits a number of temples too. The last temple of the last village that the goddess visits is dedicated to her Dharam-Bhai (brother by the virtue of duty), called Laatu-Devta. The whole area which is covered during the yatra is divided in two parts, the initial one being the Mait (Maternal Home or Mother's house) and the later half being Sauraas (In-Laws house or Husband's home). The people of the Mait region tend to get very emotional during this Yatra, as if sending off their own daughter to her Sauraas.
This Raj jat yatra originates from Kurur a village 25 kilometres from Nandprayag and yatra proceeds towards Nauti village 25 km from Karnprayag, in Karnprayag tahsil of the Indian state of Uttarakhand. The Kunwar of village Kansua and nautiyals of village nauti welcome the goddess, however the main priest of Nanda Devi Raj Jat Yatra remains the Gaurs originated from Kurur Village. The legend of this yatra is Nanda Devi, who is consort of Lord Shiva left her village and went to the Nanda Devi parbat. Therefore, when the yatra starts, heavy rain occurs as if the devi is crying. This yatra covers many villages and in the way, the Devi meets her sister in the Bhagwati village.
This journey is a difficult one because of the difficult terrain it goes through. During the journey, one passes by a Lake known as Roopkund surrounded by hundreds of ancient skeletons. According to local mythology, once a King took some dancers to this sacred spot. Due to heavy snowfall, the people were trapped and the dancers were transformed into skeletons and stones that can be seen in Patarnachonia. Another myth is this that king Yasodhwal's wife was pregnant and while she was giving birth to her child, her placenta flowed down to Roopkund and this in turn caused the death of the people there.

Nanda Devi's Worship in Kumaun
In Kumaun, Nanda Devi and Sunanda Devi are worshipped together as twin goddesses. The twin peaks of the Nanda Devi and Sunanda Devi Mountain are said to be the abode of the two goddesses. These graceful peaks are visible from most of the Kumaon Division.
During the period of Chand kings, Nanda Devi worship took the shape of a fair. Prior to that, Nanda Devi was being worshipped, but at that time only an idol of Nanda Devi used to be worshipped. The custom to make two idols started from the period of Baj Bahadur Chand. Even today, only one idol is prepared in the remote villages. The reason for this addition appears to be because the goddesses Nanda and Sunanda together took birth as princesses in the royal family and to mark this new reincarnation, the practice of celebrating a festival for both sisters together was introduced in which a story from their life is enacted.
Though in the Johar Valley region, there is no tradition of Nanda Raj Jaat but the worship, dance and the ritual of collecting Bramhakamal (it is called Kaul Kamphu) is part of Nanda festivals. The Nanda Devi fair is held at Almora, Nainital, Kot (Dangoli), Ranikhet, Bhowali, Kichha and also in the far flung villages of Lohar (like Milam and Martoli) and Pindar valleys (like Wachham and Khati). In the villages of the Pinder valley, people celebrate the Nanda Devi Jaat (journey) every year, while in Lohar people come from far and wide to Danadhar, Suring, Milam and Martoli in order to worship the Goddess. In Nainital and Almora, thousands take part in the procession carrying the dola (or palanquin) of Nanda Devi. It is said that the Nanda Devi fairs started in Kumaon during the reign of the King Kalyan Chand in the 16th century. A three-day fair is held at Kot Ki Mai or Kot Bhramari Devi. The fair at Saneti comes every second year. Both these fairs are rich in folk expressions, and many village products are brought for sale.

The masked Ramman is unique to the Saloor-Dungra village and is neither replicated nor performed anywhere else in the Himalayan region. The festival and the eponymous art form are conducted as an offering to the village deity, Bhumiyal Devta, in the courtyard of the village temple.

Deity
The guardian deity of Saloor Dungra is Bhumichetrapal, also known as Bhumiyal Devta. The festival is held in her honour every year after Baisakhi, a harvest festival that also marks the beginning of the Hindu Solar New Year. On the day of Baisakhi, the village priest announces the date for the Ramman festival which falls on the ninth or the eleventh day after Baisakhi. 
The Bhumiyal Devta comes out in a procession to the temple on the day of Baisakhi. The second day, people offer hariyali (sprouted barley plants), to the deity who, in turn, promises prosperity to all, including agricultural yield and forest produce. Every day of the festival, the Devta takes a round of the village. The festival lasts for ten days during which time the local epic of Rama is sung and masked dances depicting different aspects of life take place in the courtyard of the Bhumiyal Devta's temple It is said that the Ramman festival is celebrated here from a very old time for about 500 years, as well as the festival is celebrated jointly by the local panchayat for 11 to 13 days. Raman Festival Is organized here too, but It is said that this festival of Sallud and Dungra is more famous

Festivities and dances
The Ramman begins with an invocation to Ganesha, the remover of obstacles followed by the dance of Ganesha and Parvati. This is followed by the dance of the Sun God, an enactment of the creation-myth of the birth of Brahma and Ganesha. The other dances include the dance of the Bur Deva along with Gopi Chand (Krishna) and Radhika, the Mwar-Mwarin dance that showcases the travails of the buffalo herders and the Baniya-Baniyain Nritya (dance of the trader-couple) that shows the hardships faced by the common people. 
After these initial performances, the focus now shifts to the enactment of the local Ramkatha. Episodes from Rama's life, beginning with his visit to Janakpur and culminating with his coronation following his return from exile, are sung to a total of 324 beats and steps. Another important aspect of these performances is the singing of Jagar, a musical rendition of local legends.
There are also other dances and episodes like the Maal Nritya, Koorjogi and Narsingh Pattar Nritya that follow the Ramkatha. In the Maal Nritya, a historical battle between the Gurkhas of Nepal and the local Garhwalis is comically enacted by a troupe of four dancers dressed in red and white. It is mandatory to have a red Maal from the Kunwar caste of Saloor village, as it is believed that this hamlet supported the Gorkhas while the other three are selected by the panches of the Gram Panchayat.
In the Koorjogi ceremony, weeds (koor) from the village fields are pulled out by a Koorjogi, a character who carries a sack full of these weeds. There is much merriment as people throw these weeds at each other in a spirit of a communal sport.

Community participation
The villagers of Saloor-Dungra are the inheritors, organizers and financers of the Ramman festival. All households, irrespective of caste and community, offer prayers and perform rituals to the main deities of the Ramman. 
The roles of the various castes in the festival are however well established. Talented youth and elders selected by village heads are the performers at Ramman. The Brahmin priests conduct the rituals and prepare and serve prasada to the deity. Baaris are charged with the organization and collection of funds while the Dhaaris are a group that assists the baaris in organizing the event. The baaris and dhaaris are assigned their duties by the Gram panchas. It is also these panchas who select the residence of the Bhumiyal Devta till the next Ramman festival. The family where Bhumiyal Devta resides for the year has to maintain a strict daily routine and a place in the house is demarcated and consecrated for the deity. The Jagar is sung by the Jagaris or Bhallas of the Rajput caste who are professional bards. The playing of drums is central to the festivities and this is done by drummers of the Das community, the lowest caste, whose status is elevated during the performance.
The festival ends with a feast where the prasada of the deity is distributed as a sacrament.

Threatened and unique tradition
Ramman combines the sacred and the social, the ritualistic with revelry and expresses the history, faith, lifestyle, fears and hopes of the Saloor Dungra villagers through a mesh of oral, literary, visual, kinetic and traditional craft forms. It is an annual affair that children learn by watching. The various skills it involves in terms of dance, singing and drumming are passed down across hereditary communities orally. The onslaught of globalization and technology and lack of financial or artistic compensation have adversely impacted the ritual and traditional performances of the Ramman. Being peripheral to mainstream art forms, the awareness of the Ramman beyond its immediate borders is small and it stands the risk of becoming extinct in time.
People wearing the masks of deities and other characters, carved out of the stem of Bhoj tree (Betula Utilis) was performed by the villagers. It was introduced to the world by IGNCA (Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts), Delhi in 2008. After that festival, gained a lot of popularity among people.
In 2009, UNESCO inscribed Ramman on its Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
Ramman Mahotsav was an important attraction in the 67th Republic Day parade of India  and celebrations on 26 January 2016. In these exhibits, the cultural richness and diversity of Ramman Mahotsav was added and the traditions and heritage of the Uttarakhand region was displayed.

Summary of the Uttarakhand
Following the independence of India, the Himalayan districts of erstwhile United Provinces began to receive significant attention in the regional literature. In 1949, the Princely State of Tehri Garhwal acceded to the Union of India. With the adoption of Constitution of India in 1950, the United Provinces was renamed Uttar Pradesh and became a state of India. Even after the decades of independence, the Government of Uttar Pradesh couldn't meet the expectation to address the interests of the people in the Himalayan region. Unemployment, poverty, lack of adequate infrastructure, general underdevelopment and the migration of native (Pahari-speaking) people from the hills in search of better opportunities ultimately led to the popular demand for the creation of a separate hill state. Following the formation of Uttarakhand Kranti Dal for the purpose of achieving statehood, protests gathered momentum and took a form of widespread statehood movement across the region in 90s. The movement took a violent turn on 2 October 1994, when the Uttar Pradesh Police opened fire on a crowd of demonstrators in Muzaffarnagar, killing a number of people.
The statehood activists continued their agitation for the next several years and consequently the state of Uttarakhand was formed as Uttaranchal on 9 November 2000 by the Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2000, bifurcating the erstwhile state of Uttar Pradesh. On 1 January 2007, Uttaranchal was renamed Uttarakhand, reclaiming the name by which the region had been known prior to statehood.

It marks the occasion of Makar Sankranti, typically taking place in the second week of January. The most significant celebration occurs at Bageshwar, where the fair is held along the banks of the Saryu and Gomti rivers, particularly at the Bagnath Temple.

Etymology
The term ""Uttarayani"" is derived from two Sanskrit words: ""Uttara"" (north) and ""Ayana"" (movement or path). It refers to the sun's northward movement from the Tropic of Capricorn to the Tropic of Cancer. This astronomical event marks the end of the winter solstice and the beginning of longer days.

History
In 1921, Badri Dutt Pande, a leader from the Kumaon region and member of the Kumaun Parishad, attended the fair to mobilize local peasants against the begar system, which the British colonial administration implemented. His speeches were in support of social justice and resistance. Mahatma Gandhi also visited the fair during his 1929 tour of Kumaon.

Legends and Folklores
Local folklore associates the fair with a site where Shiva is said to have roamed as a tiger. The fair is held near the Saryu River, which is considered significant by locals. According to local tradition, the sage Markandeya is believed to have prayed to Shiva at this site, seeking blessings and guidance.

Cultural Performances
Traditional folk performances, including songs and dances such as chholiyas, Jhoras, Chancharis, and Bairas, are presented during the fair. The event also features local cuisine, including traditional dishes associated with Uttarayani celebrations, such as Ghughute, a sweet delicacy prepared specifically for this occasion.

Products
During the fair, various goods are traded. Local artisans display their works, including handcrafted items such as pottery, bamboo baskets, and metalwork. Metalwork items often comprise utensils, decorative objects, and traditional musical instruments made from iron, copper, and brass. Textiles are also a major commodity at the fair, with merchants from regions including Tibet and Nepal selling woolen products like blankets and durries. Additionally, farmers sell food items, including pulses, seeds, and spices from the hilly regions.

Locations
The Uttarayani fair is held in various towns and regions of Uttarakhand, including Nainital, Haldwani, Almora, Pithoragarh, Haridwar, Bageshwar, Rameshwar, Sult Mahadev, Ranibagh, and Hanseshwar. Additionally, the fair is also celebrated in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh.

Religious Sites
The Bagnath Temple in Bageshwar is a religious site during the Uttarayani Fair, serving as the main location for the fair and being associated with Shiva. Devotees also visit other local temples and shrines, such as the Badrinath Temple, Rameshwar, and Sult Mahadev temples, as well as sites like Chitrashila and Hanseshwar on Uttarayani day. The banks of the Saryu and Gomti rivers are also significant, where devotees perform ritual dips, believed by some to have spiritual benefits.

The festival mostly observed in the state of Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam, and celebrated annually as per Hindu calendar in the month of Amavashya of Kartik.

Overview
Bandna is a celebration of the paddy seeds that are sown by the region's agrarian communities. This festival is celebrated by the cultivator communities like Bagal, Rajuar, Kumhar, Bauri, Bagdi, Yadav, Kurmi, Kalwar, Ahir, Koiri, Gorai and several other communities of East India. It is one of many Indian festivals during which cattle are worshiped.

Celebration
Bandna is a seven-day festival: the first three days are Chumaan; the fourth day is Goth Puja; the fifth day is Goriyaa Puja; the sixth day is Borod Khuntaan; and the seventh day is Budhi Bandna. The rituals of the first three days are sometimes extended to five days prior to Goth Puja.

Myth
Lord Shiva (Burha Baba) created men, he provided them with food. In due course, they multiplied into a sizeable population. Shiva advised them to produce their own food by cultivating the land. However, without agricultural implements and technology, farmers had many problems. They beseeched the lord for a solution. Shiva took pity on them and provided them with cattle. Initially, the relationship between the men and the cattle was cordial, but over time, it worsened and the cattle were abused. The cattle complained to Shiva. The complaint encompassed strenuous work, extended work hours, inadequate food, unhygienic shelters, beatings, lack of recreation and ingratitude towards their contribution. The lord assured them that he would inspect secretly on the night of Kartik Amavasya. The men became aware of the complaints, to the people cleaned their houses and cowsheds, and on the day of Amavasya, the cattle were properly washed while their horns and foreheads were smeared with oil and vermilion. The cattle were provided with fodder and the Gohal (cowshed) was illuminated with Diyas (earthen lamps). Bundles of grass were put along with Diyas on both sides of the entrance of the cowshed. Sohrai grass was placed on the roof to signify the availability of food for the cattle. On the second day, Shiva found the people worshiping Garaiya with special offerings, including a sacrifice made in their honour. On the third day, he observed that the cattle were in a merry mood, dancing with the people. The songs and the music filled the air with warmth, enthusiasm and harmony. On his way back, he found the Bagals/Dhangars (contractual header) playing with the cattle at the gochar (grazing land). This made the complaint invalid. The next season, the cattle complained again about hardships, prompting Shiva to inspect them on the same day. The lord made a secret visit, finding the cattle happy and content. Since then, the tradition continued and is annually celebrated as Bandna Parab.

In the past, Bengali Hindus Sadagaras participated in a variety of trades, therefore their festivals and rituals from that time period were incorporated into it.

Description
This festival is held on the final Thursday of the month of Bhadra (Hindu calendar) each year, and it is celebrated in the Bhagirathi -Ganga by floating rafts and boats that have been decked with multicolored lamps. JH Walsh writes in ""A History of Murshidabad District"" that this celebration was once held by Murshid Quli Khan. But he had no understanding that Murshid Quli Khan was leading to this event. It began in Dhaka in 1690, when Mukarram Khan was the Subedar of Bengal and Mughal King Jahangir was in power. After Murshid Quli Khan moved his capital from Dhaka to Murshidabad in 1704, it began here at Hazarduari Ghat.
In front of the Hazarduari Palace, the ropes that connected the cannon to the gunnery hall were severed so that the rafts could be torn apart. The boats travel at a slow pace, and their music is timed to the rhythm of the water. Bamboo and banana tree trunks are used in their construction. One of the most important manufacturing centers for these kind of boats is located in Jafarganj, which is located in Murshidabad.

Celebrations during Nawabi Period
During the Nawabi period, banana trees were floated on water, and bamboo-bakhari-chicha-mats were used to build items like minarets, arches, domes, niches, forts, etc. Mica sheets were often used to make lights that showed Quranic verses, churches, trees, and other things. On boats, silver-covered fake lights were hanging from the ceiling. The Ganges used to shine from Lalbagh in Murshidabad to Mahinagar. Different dance songs were set up. The Nawabs and their people loved the fireworks show.

Location
Bhadu festival is mostly celebrated in Purulia, Bankura, Birbhum and Bardhaman districts of West Bengal.

Folklore
The Bhadu festival is centered around the legend of the princess Bhadu. According to legend, she was found as an orphan by the chief of Lada village. Bhadu is said to be the living embodiment of the goddess Lakshmi. The chief adopts her and secretly raises her as a princess. Bhadu falls in love with Anjan, the son of a doctor in a neighboring village. The king does not approve of the relationship and has Anjan imprisoned. Bhadu and two companions then travel the kingdom singing song at the gates of forts and prisons, hoping that Anjan will hear her voice. The king eventually releases Anjan, but by then Bhadu has disappeared, and is said to have faded away and merged with the sky.
The songs of the Bhadu festival are based on those that Bhadu was believed to have sung.

Songs
Bhadu gaan, an inseparable part of Bhadu festival reflects the colours of rural society. It used to be very popular in Burdwan, Bankura and Midnapore. But in Birbhum the existence of this unique genre is being threatened by the rising popularity of cinema and television. Bhadu songs are composed extemporaneously and sung on each night of the festival, depicting the Goddesses as young girls. They describe Bhadu and tell in loving detail how they will be entertained. Since Bhadu is unmarried, her songs are sung mostly by unmarried girls. Dancing and playing drums accompanies Bhadu.

Names
In West Bengal, Odisha, Assam, Jharkhand and Tripura, Durga Puja is also called Akalbodhan (literally, ""untimely awakening of Durga""), Sharadiya pujo or puja (""autumnal worship""), Sharodotsab (""festival of autumn""), Maha pujo (""grand puja""), Maayer pujo (""worship of the Mother""), Durga pujo, or merely Puja(In Odisha, Bihar) or Pujo. In Bangladesh, Durga Puja has historically been celebrated as Bhagabati puja. Maa Durga is known as the Goddess of Power (feminine) which represents triumph of Goodness over evil.
Durga Puja is also referred to by the names of related Shakta Hindu festivals such as Navaratri, celebrated on the same days elsewhere in India; such as in Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Kerala, and Maharashtra, Kullu Dussehra, celebrated in Kullu Valley, Himachal Pradesh; Mysore Dussehra celebrated in Mysore, Karnataka; Bommai Golu, celebrated in Tamil Nadu; Bommala Koluvu, celebrated in Andhra Pradesh; and Bathukamma, celebrated in Telangana.

History and origins
Durga is an ancient goddess of Hinduism according to available archeological and textual evidence. However, the origins of Durga Puja are unclear and undocumented.

The name Durga, and related terms, appear in Vedic literature, such as in the Rigveda hymns 4.28, 5.34, 8.27, 8.47, 8.93 and 10.127, and in sections 10.1 and 12.4 of the Atharvaveda A deity named Durgi appears in section 10.1.7 of the Taittiriya Aranyaka. While the Vedic literature uses the word Durga, the description therein lacks legendary details about her or about Durga Puja that is found in later Hindu literature.
A key text associated with Durga Puja is Devi Mahatmya, which is recited during the festival. Durga was likely well established by the time this Hindu text was composed, the date of which scholars estimate as between 400 and 600 CE. The Devi Mahatmya scripture describes the nature of evil forces symbolised by Mahishasura as shape-shifting, deceptive, and adapting in nature, in form and in strategy to create difficulties and thus achieve their evil ends. Durga calmly understands and counters the evil in order to achieve her solemn goals.Durga, in her various forms, appears as an independent deity in the Indian texts.
In the Mahabharata, both Yudhisthira and Arjuna invoke hymns to Durga. She appears in Harivamsa in the form of Vishnu's eulogy and in Pradyumna's prayer. The prominent mention of Durga in such epics may have led to her worship.

Some versions of the Puranas mention Durga Puja to be a spring festival, while the Devi-Bhagavata Purana and two other Shakta Puranas mentions it to be an autumn festival. The Ramayana manuscripts are also inconsistent. Versions of Ramayana found in the north, west, and south of the Indian subcontinent describe Rama to be remembering Surya (the Hindu sun god) before his battle against Ravana, but the Bengali manuscripts of Ramayana, such as the Krittivasi Ramayana, a 15th-century manuscript by Krttivasa, mention Rama to be worshipping Durga. As per the legend, Rama worshipped Durga in the autumn to have her blessings before defeating Ravana. While he was preparing for the worship of the goddess, Durga hid one of the 108 flowers of lotus, very essential for her worship. Having found only 107 of 108 lotuses at the time of the worship, Rama decided to offer one of his eyes in place of that lotus. When he was about to offer his eye, Durga appeared and told him that she had only hidden the flower in order to test his devotion and she was satisfied with it. She blessed Rama and he continued with her worship. Since the gods are believed to be sleeping during autumn, the awakening rite of the Durga puja is also known as akāla bodhana.
Surviving manuscripts from the 14th-century provide guidelines for Durga Puja, while historical records suggest the royalty and wealthy families to be sponsoring major Durga Puja public festivities, since at least the 16th-century. The 11th or 12th-century Jain text Yasatilaka by Somadeva mentions an annual festival dedicated to a warrior goddess, celebrated by the king and his armed forces, and the description mirrors attributes of Durga Puja.
According to some scholars, the worship of the fierce warrior goddess Durga, and her darker and more violent manifestation Kali, became popular in the Bengal region during and after the medieval era, marked by Muslim invasions and conquests.
The significance of Durga and other goddesses in Hindu culture is stated to have increased after Islamic armies conquered regions of the Indian subcontinent. According to yet other scholars, the marginalization of Bengali Hindus during the medieval era led to a reassertion of Hindu identity and an emphasis on Durga Puja as a social festival, publicly celebrating the warrior goddess.From the medieval era up to present-day, Durga Puja has been celebrated as a socio-cultural event, while maintaining the roots of religious worship.

Rituals and practices
Texts
The puja rituals involve mantras (words manifesting spiritual transformation), shlokas (holy verses), chants and arati, and offerings. The worship begins with a reading of the Sanskrit Devī Mahātmya from the sixth-century Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa. The shlokas and mantras praise the divinity of the goddess; according to the shlokas, Durga is omnipresent as the embodiment of power, nourishment, memory, forbearance, faith, forgiveness, intellect, wealth, emotions, desires, beauty, satisfaction, righteousness, fulfillment and peace.

Relation to harvest
Durga Puja is, in part, a post-monsoon harvest festival observed on the same days in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism as those in its other traditions. The practice of including a bundle of nine different plants, called navapatrika, as a symbolism of Durga, is a testament practice to its agricultural importance. The typically selected plants include not only representative important crops, but also non-crops. This probably signifies the Hindu belief that the goddess is ""not merely the power inherent in the growth of crops but the power inherent in all vegetation"".
The festival is a social and public event in the eastern and northeastern states of India, where it dominates religious and socio-cultural life, with temporary pandals built at community squares, roadside shrines, and temples. The festival is also observed by some Shakta Hindus as a private home-based festival.
Before Durga puja there is Paata Puja, the ritual of making an idol on the day of the Rath Yatra, usually around July. 'Paata' is the wooden frame that forms the base for the idols.

Day One
Durga Puja is a ten-day event. The festival begins with Mahalaya, a day on which Hindus perform tarpaṇa by offering water and food to their dead ancestors. The day also marks the arrival of Durga from her marital home in Kailash.
The festival starts at twilight with prayers to Saraswati. She is believed to be another aspect of goddess Durga. This is also the day when the eyes are painted of the deities on the representative clay sculpture-idols, bringing them to a lifelike appearance. The day also marks prayers to Ganesha and visit to pandals and temples.

Day Two to Five
Day two to five mark the remembrance of the goddess and her manifestations, such as Kumari (goddess of fertility), Mai (mother), Ajima (grandmother), Lakshmi (goddess of wealth) and in some regions as the Saptamatrikas (seven mothers) or Navadurga (nine aspects of Durga). On the sixth day major festivities and social celebrations start. The first nine days overlap with Navaratri festivities in other traditions of Hinduism.The specific practices vary by region.

Day Six to Nine
The next significant day of the festival is the sixth day (Shashthi), on which devotees welcomes the goddess and festive celebrations are inaugurated. Rituals typically performed on the sixth day include:
Bodhana: Involves rites to awaken and welcome the goddess to be a guest. The amorphous sight of the goddess is consecrated into a ghata or noggin while the visible sight is consecrated into the murti or idol. These rituals are known as ghatasthapana and  pranapratistha respectively.
Adhivasa: Anointing ritual wherein symbolic offerings are made to Durga, with each item representing a remembrance of subtle forms of her.
On the seventh day (Saptami), eighth (Ashtami) and ninth (Navami) days, the goddess along with Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha, and Kartikeya are revered and these days mark the main days of worship with recitation of scriptures, puja, legends of Durga in Devi Mahatmya, social visits to elaborately decorated and illuminated pandals (temporary structures meant for hosting the puja), among others.

Navapatrika snan: Bathing of the navapatrika with holy water done on the seventh day of the festival.
Sandhi puja and Ashtami pushpanjali: The eighth day begins with elaborate pushpanjali rituals. The cusp of the ending of the eighth day and beginning of the ninth day is considered to be the moment when per scriptures Durga engaged in a fierce battle against Mahishasura and was attacked by the demons Chanda and Munda. Goddess Chamunda emerged from the third eye of Durga and killed Chanda and Munda at the cusp of Ashtami and Navami, the eighth and ninth days respectively. This moment is marked by the sandhi puja, involving the offering of 108 lotuses and lighting of 108 lamps. It is a forty-eight minutes long ritual commemorating the climax of battle. The rituals are performed in the last 24 minutes of Ashtami and the first 24 minutes of Navami. In some regions, devotees sacrifice an animal such as a buffalo or goat, but in many regions, there is not an actual animal sacrifice and a symbolic sacrifice substitutes it. The surrogate effigy is smeared in red vermilion to symbolize the blood spilled. The goddess is then offered food (bhog). Some places also engage in devotional service.

Homa and bhog: The ninth day of festival is marked with the homa (fire oblation) rituals and bhog. Some places also perform kumari puja on this day.

Day Ten
Sindoor khela and immersion: The tenth and last day, called Vijaya Dashami is marked by sindoor khela, where women smear sindoor or vermillion on the sculpture-idols and also smear each other with it. This ritual signifies the wishing of a blissful marital life for married women. Historically the ritual has been restricted to married women. The tenth day is the day when Durga emerged victorious against Mahishasura and it ends with a procession where the clay sculpture-idols are ceremoniously taken to a river or coast for immersion rites. Following the immersion, Durga is believed to return to her mythological marital home of Kailasa to Shiva and the cosmos in general. People distribute sweets and gifts, visit their friends and family members on the tenth day. Some communities such as those near Varanasi mark the day after Vijaya Dashami, called Ekadashi, by visiting a Durga temple.

Dhunuchi naach and dhuno pora: Dhunuchi naach involves a dance ritual performed with dhunuchi (incense burner). Drummers called dhakis, carrying large leather-strung Dhaks, Dhols and other traditional drums depending on the region, to create music, to which people dance either during or not during aarati. Some places, especially home pujas, also observe dhuno pora, a ritual involving married women carrying dhunuchis burning with incense and dried coconuts, on a cloth on their head and hands,

Decorations, sculptures, and stages
The process of the creation of clay sculpture-idols (pratima or murti) for the puja, from the collection of clay to the ornamentation is a ceremonial process. Though the festival is observed post-monsoon harvest, the artisans begin making the sculpture-idols months before, during summer. The process begins with prayers to Ganesha and to the perceived divinity in materials such as bamboo frames in which the sculpture-idols are cast.

Clay, or alluvial soil, collected from different regions form the base. This choice is a tradition wherein Durga, perceived as the creative energy and material, is believed to be present everywhere and in everything in the universe. In certain traditions in Kolkata, a custom is to include soil samples in the clay mixture for Durga from areas believed to be nishiddho pallis (forbidden territories; territories inhabited by the ""social outcasts"" such as brothels).
The clay base is combined with straw, kneaded, and then molded into a cast made from hay and bamboo. This is layered to a fine final shape, cleaned, painted, and polished. A layer of a fiber called jute, mixed in with clay, is also attached to the top to prevent the statue from cracking in the months ahead. The heads of the statues are more complex and are usually made separately. The limbs of the statues are mostly shaped from bundles of straws. Then, starting about August, the local artisans hand-paint the sculpture-idols which are later dressed in clothing, are decorated and bejewelled, and displayed at the puja altars.
The procedure for and proportions of the sculpture-idols are described in arts-related Sanskrit texts of Hinduism, such as the Vishvakarma Sashtra.

Environmental impact
The sculpture-idols for the puja are traditionally made of biodegradable materials such as straw, clay, soil, and wood. In today's times, brighter colored statues have increased in popularity and have diversified the use of non-biodegradable, cheaper or more colorful substitute synthetic raw materials. Environmental activists have raised concerns about the paint used to produce the statue, stating that the heavy metals in these paints pollute rivers when the statues are immersed at the end of the Durga festival.
Brighter colors that are also biodegradable and eco-friendly, as well as the traditional natural colors, are typically more expensive compared to the non biodegradable paints. The Indian state of West Bengal has banned the use of hazardous paints, and various state government have started distributing lead-free paints to artisans at no cost to prevent pollution.

Animal sacrifice, symbolic sacrifice
Shakta Hindu communities mark the slaying of Mahishasura and the victory of Durga with a symbolic or actual sacrifice. Most communities prefer symbolic sacrifice, where a statue of the asura is made of flour or equivalent, is immolated and smeared with vermilion, symbolic of the blood that had spilled during the battle. Other substitutes include a vegetable or a sweet dish considered equivalent to the animal. In certain instances, devotees consider animal sacrifice distasteful, and practice alternate means of expressing devotion while respecting the views of others in their tradition.
In communities performing actual sacrifice, an animal is sacrificed, mainly at temples. In Nepal, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam, animal sacrifices are performed at Shakta temples to commemorate the legend of Durga slaying Mahishasura. This involves slaying of a fowl, pig, goat, or male water-buffalo. Large scale animal sacrifices are rare among Hindus outside the regions of Bengal, Odisha, Assam, and Nepal. In these regions, festivals are primarily when significant animal sacrifices are  observed.
The Rajputs of Rajasthan worship their weapons and horses in the related festival of Navaratri, and some historically observed the sacrifice of a goat, a practice that continues in some places. The sacrifice ritual, supervised he the priest, requires slaying of the animal with a single stroke. In the past this ritual was considered a rite of passage into manhood and readiness as a warrior. The Kuldevi (clan deity) among these Rajput communities is a warrior goddess, with local legends tracing reverence for her during Rajput-Muslim wars.

Pandals and theme-based pujas
Months before the start of Durga Puja, youth members of the community collect funds and donations, engage priests and artisans, buy votive materials and help build pandals centered around a theme, which has rose to prominence in recent years. Such themes have included sex work, celebration of humanity, marginalization of queer persons and transgender persons, folk culture, celebration of cinema, womanhood,  pro-environment themes, while others have chosen metaphorical themes such as celebration of maati (literally, soil or ash) and ""finding one's own light"". Pandals have also been replicated on existing temples, structures, and monuments and yet others have been made of elements such as metal scraps, nails, and turmeric among others. Durga Puja pandals have also been centered around themes to acknowledge political events such as the 2019 Balakot airstrike and to protest against the National Register of Citizens of India.
The budget required for such theme-based pujas is significantly higher than traditional pujas. For such theme-based pujas, the preparations and the building of pandals are a significant arts-related economic activity, often attracting major sponsors. Such commercialized pujas attract crowds of visitors. The growth of competitiveness in theme-based pandals has escalated costs and scale of Durga Puja in eastern states of India. Some segments of the society criticize the billboards, the economic competition, and seek return to basics. The competition takes many forms, such as the height of statue. In 2015, an 88-foot statue of Durga in Kolkata's Deshapriya Park attracted numerous devotees, with some estimates placing visitors at one million.

Regional celebrations and observances
There exists variation in Durga Puja worship practices and rituals, as is the case with other Hindu festivals, in the Indian subcontinent. Hinduism accepts flexibility and leaves the set of practices to the choice of the individuals concerned. Different localized rituals may be observed regionally, with these variations accepted across temples, pandals, and within families.
The festival is most commonly associated with Bengali Hindus, and with the community having variability and differences in practices. There may exist differences of practice between the puja of theme-based Pandals, family pujas (with puja of erstwhile aristocrat families known as bonedi puja), and community pujas (known as barowari pujas) of neighbourhoods or apartments.
The rituals of the puja also varies from being Vedic, Puranic, or Tantric, or a combination of these. The Bengali Durga Puja rituals typically combine all three. The non-Bengali Durga Puja rituals tend to be essentially Vedic (srauta) in nature but they too incorporate esoteric elements making the puja an example of a culmination of Vedic-Tantric practices.
Historical evidence suggests that the Durga Puja has evolved over time, becoming more elaborate, social, and creative. The festival had earlier been a domestic puja, a form of practice that still remains popular. But it had also come to be celebrated in the sarvajanin (public) form, where communities get together, pool their resources and efforts to set up pandals and illuminations, and celebrate the event as a ""mega-show to share"". The origins of this variation are unclear, with some sources suggesting a family in Kolkata reviving such celebration in 1411 CE. While other set of sources suggest that a Bengali landlord, named Kamsanarayan, held a mega-show puja in late 16th-century Bengal. Yet, this festival of Bengal is likely much older with the discovery of 11th and 12th-century Durga Puja manual manuscripts such as Durgotsavaviveka, Durgotsava Prayoga, Vasantaviveka and Kalaviveka. The rituals associated with the Durga Puja migrated to other regions from Bengal, such as in Varanasi, a city that has historically attracted sponsorship from Hindus from various parts of the Indian subcontinent including Bengal. In contemporary India, Durga Puja is celebrated in various styles and forms.
In Kolkata, Durga Puja is an annual festival celebrated magnificently. Kolkata alone hosted more than 3,000 Barowari pujas in Kolkata in 2022, with more than 200 pujas were organized in the city with a budget of over one crore rupees. Kolkata has been inscribed on the list of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists in December 2021.
In Bishnupur, West Bengal, Durga Puja holds a unique and significant place. The district boasts the Rajbari Durga Puja, also known as the Mrinmoyee Maa er pujo, which dates back to 994 AD. This makes it the oldest Durga Puja in the entire Bengal region, encompassing present-day Bangladesh, Odisha, and Tripura.
In Basirhat, West Bengal, the scale and intensity of durga puja celebration is among the biggest in North 24 Parganas district with more than 100 installations in the city. For more than 150 years, the Durga idol has been immersed on boats in this city. On the day of Vijayadashami, people usually come in Basirhat to see the immersion festival. The idols and installations have changed in the modern era, but the immersion continues to be done in the Ichamati River by boat according to the ancient tradition. A fair is held on both banks of the river centering on the immersion. The special attraction of this fair is wooden furniture and various wooden items.

Durga Puja is a widely celebrated festival in the Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh (eastern parts), Assam, and Odisha. It is celebrated over a five-day period. Streets are decked up with festive lights, loudspeakers play festive songs as well as recitation of hymns and chants by priests, and pandals are erected by communities. The roads become overcrowded with revellers, devotees, and pandal-hoppers visiting the pandals on puja days. It often creates chaotic traffic conditions. Shops, eateries, and restaurants stay open all night; fairs are also set up and cultural programmes are held. People form organizing committees, which plan and oversee the pandal during the festivities. Today, Durga Puja has turned into a consumerist social carnival, a major public spectacle and a major arts event riding on the wave of commercialisation, corporate sponsorship, and craze for award-winning. For private domestic pujas, families dedicate an area of their homes, known as thakur dalan, for Durga Puja where the sculpture-idols for worship is placed and decorated with home-dyed fabric, sola ornamentations, and gold and silver foil decorations. Elaborate rituals like arati are performed and prasad is distributed after being offered to the deities. As a tradition, married daughters visit their parents and celebrate the Durga Puja with them, a symbolism alluding to Durga who is popularly believed to return to her natal home during the puja.

Durga Puja is also a gift-giving and shopping season for communities celebrating it, with people buying gifts for not only family members but also for close relatives and friends. New clothes are the traditional gift, and people wear them to go out together during Durga Puja. During puja holidays, people may also go to places of tourist attractions while others return home to spend Durga Puja with their family. It's a common trend amongst youngsters and even those who are older to go pandal-hopping and enjoy the celebrations.
The organising committees of each puja pandal hires a purohita (priest) who performs the puja rituals on behalf of the community. For the priests, Durga Puja is a time of activity wherein he pursues the timely completion of Vedic-Puranic-Tantric ritual sequences to make various offerings and perform fire oblations, in full public view, while the socio-cultural festivities occur in parallel. The complex puja rituals include periods of accurate and melodic scripture recitation. The puja involves crowds of people visiting the pandals, with smaller groups visiting family pujas, to witness the celebrations. On the last day, the sculpture-idols are carried out in immersion processions across Bengal, following which they are ritually immersed into rivers or other waterbodies. The immersion ceremony continues till a couple of days after the last day of puja.

According to some scholars, the ritual of immersing the Durga sculpture-idol into the river attracted the attention of colonial era travelers to the Bengal region from Europe, such as Garcin de Tassy and Emma Roberts. In 1831, Tassy reported that similar rituals were annually observed by the Muslim community in Bengal. Shia Bengali Muslims observed Muharram over ten days, taking out processions in memory of the martyrdom of Imam Husayn ibn Ali, and then cast a memorial Imam's cenotaph into a river on the tenth day. Tassy further stated that the Bengali rituals of Muharram included the same offerings at the annual observation of Muharram that the Hindu rituals included during Durga Puja. According to yet other scholars, the ritual of immersion in water by Hindus for Durga Puja in Bengal and Ganesh Chaturthi in the western states of India, may have grown because members of the Hindu community attempted to create a competing procession and immersion ritual to that of Muharram, allowed by the colonial British Indian government in the 19th and early 20th-centuries.

In Maharashtra, the city of Nashik and other places such as CIDCO, Rajeevnagar, Panchavati, and Mahatmanagar host Durga Puja celebrations. While in Delhi, the first community Durga Puja was organized near Kashmiri Gate by a group of expatriate Bengalis, in 1910, a year before Delhi was declared the capital of British India. This group came to be the Delhi Durga Puja Samiti, popularly known as the Kashmere Gate Durga Puja. The Durga Puja at Timarpur, Delhi was started in the year 1914. In 2011, over 800 Durga Pujas were held in Delhi, with a few hundred more in Gurgaon and NOIDA.

In Odisha, Durga Puja is the most important festival of the people of the state. Durga Puja is a very important festival for Odias, during the 4 days of the festival, the streets of the city turns into a wonderland throughout the state, people welcome the arrival of their maa by rejoicing themselves, eating tasty food, wearing new clothes, seeing different pandals across the city, family gathering and gift givings. In 2019, ninety-seven pandals in Cuttack alone, Odisha were reported to bedeck respective sculpture-idols with silver jewelry for Durga Puja celebrations; such club of pandals termed regionally as Chandi Medha. The state capital is famous for the modern themes and creativity In the pandals, while the Western part of the state has a more retro decoration theme to the pandal. In the northern parts of the state particularly Balasore, Durga Puja is celebrated with much fervor and the Odia diaspora abroad especially in Australia, which originates 95% from the district of Balasore celebrates the puja in the same manner which is done back home in Balasore. In September 2019, 160 pandals were reported to be hosting Durga Puja in Cuttack.
While in Tripura there were over 2,500 community Durga Puja celebrations in 2013. Durga Puja has been started at the Durgabari temple, in Agartala by King Radha Kishore Manikya Bahadur.

Significance
Beyond being an art festival and a socio-religious event, Durga Puja has also been a political event with regional and national political parties having sponsored Durga Puja celebrations. In 2019, West Bengal Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee announced a grant of ₹25,000 to all community-organised Durga Pujas in the state.
In 2019, Kolkata's Durga Puja was nominated by the Indian government for the 2020 UNESCO Representative list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Durga Puja also stands to be politically and economically significant. The committees organising Durga Puja in Kolkata have close links to politicians. Politicians patronize the festival by making donations or helping raise money for funding of community pujas, or by marking their presence at puja events and inaugurations. The grant of ₹25,000 to puja organizing committees in West Bengal by a debt-ridden state government was reported to cost a budget a ₹70 crores. The state government also announced an additional grant of ₹5,000 to puja organizing committees fully managed by women alone, while also announcing a twenty-five percent concession on total electricity bills for puja pandal. The government had made a grant of ₹10,000 each to more than 20,000 puja organizing committees in the state in 2018.
A 2013 report by ASSOCHAM states West Bengal's Durga Puja to be a ₹25,000 crores worth economy, expected to grow at the compound annual growth rate of about 35 per-cent. Economic slowdowns in India, such as in 2019, have hence affected corporate sponsorships and puja budgets for public celebrations. In August 2019, the Income Tax Department of India had allegedly sent notices to various Durga Puja organizing committees in West Bengal, against which the ruling party of the state, All India Trinamool Congress (AITMC) protested. The Central Board of Direct Taxes denied sending any such notices, to which AITMC politician Madan Mitra is reported to have said that the intention may have been to enquire if tax deducted at source had been deducted on payments to vendors for organizing community pujas.

Economic significance
Durga Puja directly affects the economy. In 2022, the economy of West Bengal was estimated to get a boost of 50,000 crore rupees. The annual GDP of West Bengal was expected to be expanded by 20-30 percent that year. The factors responsible for this economic boost are mainly the increase of earning in transport, tourism, industry, business, shopping and other fields. The Kolkata Metro Railway recorded an earning of ₹6 crore in just five days of Durga Puja in 2022.
The famous puja pandals get sponsorship from renowned companies and labels. Usually, the dress and jewelries of the idols, the material used to make the typically very elaborate pandals, decorations, lightings are sponsored.

Social significance
Durga Puja plays a great significance in the living of certain peoples. The kumors, those who make the idols with clay and also makes other clayey products, earns lakhs of rupees by selling a single set of Durga idol of average size. Hence, it makes their annual income because idols used in other festivals are a lot more cheaper. Other professions that receive the majority of their annual income are dhaaki (plays dhaak), priest and other small homecrafts. It is assumed that these profession based small classes would become smaller in population if Durga Puja was absent.

Media attention
The day of Mahalaya is marked by the Indian Hindu community of West Bengal with Mahishasuramardini — a two-hours long All India Radio program — that has been popular in the Bengali community since the 1950s. While in earlier days it used to be recorded live, a pre-recorded version has come to be broadcast in recent decades. Bengalis traditionally wake up at four in the morning on Mahalaya to listen to the radio show, primarily involving recitations of chants and hymns from Devi Mahatmyam (or Chandi Path) by Birendra Krishna Bhadra and Pankaj Kumar Mullick. The show also features various devotional melodies.
Dramas enacting the legend of Durga slaying Mahishasura are telecasted on the television. Radio and television channels also air other festive shows, while Bengali and Odia magazines publish special editions for the puja known as Pujabarshiki (Annual Puja Edition) or Sharadiya Sankhya (Autumnal Volume). These contain works of writers, both established and upcoming, and are more voluminous than the regular issues. Some notable examples of such magazines in Bengali are Anandamela, Shuktara, Desh, Sananda, Nabakallol, and Bartaman.

Celebrations outside India
Durga Puja is celebrated commonly by both Bangladesh's Bengali and non-Bengali Hindu community. Some Bengali Muslims also take part in the festivities. In Dhaka, the Dhakeshwari Temple puja attracts visitors and devotees. In Nepal, the festivities are celebrated as Dashain.
Beyond South Asia, Durga Puja is organized by Bengali communities across the world.

North America
In the United States Durga Puja is celebrated across the country in many cities. The oldest community Durga Puja in the US was held in Columbia University organized by the East Coast Durga Puja Association (ECDPA) in 1970. While many community pujas are typically held over a Friday-Sunday period, some pujas in the US e.g. organized by Bharat Sevashram Shangha, Paschimi, Women's Now and others follow the full 5 day schedule.  While most major metropolitan centers have multiple Durga Pujas organized by multiple Bengali organizations, Saikat  in San Diego, CA and SABCC in San Antonio, TX are two of the biggest American cities to have an unified Durga Pujas for the whole metropolitan area.  In addition to the actual puja, most Durga Pujas in North America have a tradition of having elaborate cultural events involving both local artists and invited professional artists from India.

Celebrations are also organized in Europe. The sculpture-idols are shipped from India and stored in warehouses to be re-used over the years. According to BBC News, for community celebrations in London in 2006, these ""idols, belonging to a tableau measuring 18ft by 20ft, were made from clay,straw and vegetable dyes"". At the end of the puja, the sculpture-idols were immersed in River Thames for the first time in 2006, after ""the community was allowed to give a traditional send-off to the deities by London's port authorities"". In Germany, the puja is celebrated in Cologne, and other cities. In Switzerland, puja in Baden, Aargau has been celebrated since 2003.

Durga Puja in Kolkata has been inscribed on the list of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists in December 2021.

History
Beginning
Since 1610, the Sabarna Roy Choudhury family has been organizing Durga Puja at their original residence in Barisha, Kolkata. This is probably the oldest Durga Puja festival in Kolkata. Nabakrishna Dev started Durga Puja at Shobhabazar Rajbari in 1757.

Barowari Durga Puja began in Kolkata in the early part of the twentieth century. Barwari Durga Puja quickly became a common people's festival in Kolkata. Earlier, Durga Puja in Kolkata was confined to wealthy families. In 1910, the first Barowari Durga Puja in Kolkata was organized by ""Bhowanipore Sanatan Dharmatsahini Sabha"" at Balram Basu Ghat Road, Bhowanipore.
Since 1985, the Asian Paints Authority has introduced the practice of awarding the Durga Puja Committees of Kolkata. This award is called the Asian Paints Sharad Shamman. Later many other commercial organizations introduced ""Sharad Samman"" or Durga Puja awards for Durga Puja in Kolkata.
The Government of West Bengal introduced Biswa Bangla Sharad Samman in 2013.

Expansion

Durga puja carnival
Durga Puja Carnival started in Kolkata in 2016. The carnival was not organized in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID-19 pandemic. It was again organized from 2022.

Recognition of UNESCO
In 2019, Tapati Guha-Thakurta was entrusted with the task of preparing a dossier by the Indian Ministry of Culture. The dossier was submitted to UNESCO for the inclusion of Durga Puja in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Representatives from various countries around the world evaluated the dossier at the 16th session, which began in Paris on 13 December 2021. ""Durga Puja in Kolkata"" gets Intangible Cultural Heritage status on 15 December 2021.

Puja: The Festival
Durga Puja is mainly celebrated for 5 days - Shashti, Saptami, Ashtami, Navami and Vijaya Dashami. But the festive mood around Durga Puja in Kolkata starts before Shashti, mainly from Mahalaya. Durga Puja pandals are opened to the public from the day of Mahalaya. The main attractions of Durga Puja in Kolkata are the decorations, sculptures, pandals, lights and illuminations, and carnival.

Evolution of The Puja
In the 17th century, from Pujas being organised by the zamindars in their rajbaris, today the festival has become an emblem of joy and unbounded enjoyment. Always considered as a symbol of homecoming, centered around the deity herself, in the present day the Puja has become synonymous with extravagant pandals, pandal hopping, incorporation of various themes and also  witnessing a huge array of lights. It has become a way of seeing and situating ourselves in the world.
Even till the 20th century also Kolkata's Durga Puja was primarily a religious and familial event, where different communities came together to worship her and partake in the age-old traditions associated with the festival. While the emotions, essence of devotion and community spirit still thrives, Durga Puja has undergone remarkable changes in terms of scale, style and cultural significance. 
The most remarkable changes in the recent times include the exponential proliferation in the number of pujas across the city, an emphasis on creative art and a overwhelming crowd of people visiting the pandals every year. The city has witnessed a surge in the number of theme-based pujas over the years. The themes range from various artistic ideas, cultural traditions, famous monuments around the world and even biographies of famous persons. 
While the centuries-old rajbari pujas with their Sabeki Protima and traditions are still popular, theme based pujas have risen in the present scenario and have become extremely popular, recording huge number of footfalls every year. Due to ginormous number of people visiting pandals every year and overcrowding on the main five days, pandals are inaugurated from Mahalaya, much before Shashti. The magnification in the cost of expenditure has also lead the budget to be shifted from only chandas to advertisements and certain extent of government funding. Despite this changes, people have whole heartedly welcomed the new pinch to their age-old tradition and this festival has also turned out to be a melting pot of people from different religions, who enjoy the festivities.

Government Assistance
In 2018, CM Mamata Banerjee announced that every year ₹10,000 will be given to 3000 puja committees in Kolkata and 25000 puja committees in the districts all over Bengal. The decision was opposed by the opposition parties. In response to a petition filed, the Calcutta High Court refused to interfere with the decision. Later, the Supreme Court of India refused to put a stay order on the incentives but asked the government to keep a record of the grants given.
In 2019, the amount was increased to ₹25,000 for each puja committee. Over the years, the amount has been increased to ₹50,000 in 2020 and ₹60,000−70,000 in 2022. In 2022, the total amount granted to all the pujas in that year alone  stood at ₹258 crore. In 2024, the government increased the amount to ₹85,000 for each puja committee. The total amount was more than ₹365 crore for all the puja committees. The costs would include a 75% concession in the electricity bill for the committees.

Economy
A study - Mapping the Creative Economy around the Durga Puja - has been commissioned by the British Council on behalf of the Department of Tourism, Government of West Bengal. In 2021, the British Council in India mapped the creative economy of Durga Puja at ₹32,000 crores for the year 2019 and added that the festival contributed 2.58% of the GDP of West Bengal in financial year 2019–2020. ""Durga Puja in Kolkata"" contributes to a large part of this creative economy.
The economy of Durga Puja in Kolkata is divided into various sectors. Major among the various economic sectors are installation, art and decoration, Idol making, lighting and illumination, literature and publishing, sponsorship, advertising, retail, crafts and design (Puja Utensils), film and entertainment, and food and beverage. In 2019, Kolkata accounts for 15% share of pandal-making (installation, art and decoration) industry of West Bengal, worth ₹129 crores. Both the idol making industry and the lighting and lighting industry contributed ₹120 crores to Durga puja in Kolkata. In 2022, the collective economy of Durga Puja was around ₹40,000 crore and it created employment opportunities for three lakh people. By 2024, the economy stood around ₹50,000 crores.

Bengali New Year
The Bengali New Year or ""Poila Baisakh"" (the first day of the month of Baisakh) is celebrated around 15 April on the basis of the lunar calendar of Bangabda.  Visitors to homes are greeted with sweets, and trade establishments are decorated with auspicious garlands of marigold and 'aam' leaves. Shop-owners and businessmen offer puja at Dakshineshwar Kali Temple and Kalighat Kali Temple in the morning with new ledgers (halkhata). Businessmen also offer free sweets as a goodwill gesture on this day.  It is celebrated by cultural programmes throughout Kolkata.

Religious festivals
Durga Puja
Durga Puja, held in September–October, is the biggest and most important festival of West Bengal as well as of Kolkata. It marks the victory of ten-armed goddess Durga over the buffalo demon Mahishasur and signifies the victory of good over evil. The festival commences on Mahalaya, a week before the actual Puja celebrations begin on Sashthi and continue through Saptami, Ashtami, Navami and Vijaya Dashami, when the festival comes to an end. Pandals are set up and idols of goddess Durga and her four children - Lakshmi, Saraswati, Kartik, Ganesh are worshipped and displayed for five days across the state, especially in Kolkata. Some 3000 pandals are erected throughout Kolkata and its suburbs. Pujas are also conducted in sizeable number of family households. Elaborate rituals are performed by priests amid sound of drums (dhaak), conch shell (shaankh) and bells, and many devotees join in the prayers.
Although the root of Durga Puja is essentially religious, the festival has slowly changed into more of a social carnival than a religious festival, where people from other religious or ethnic backgrounds freely participate in the festivity. It has become Kolkata's biggest public spectacle, glamorous art event and consumerist carnival. The city is decked up with lighting decorations. Loudspeakers play popular songs as well as recitation of mantras by priests. Shops, restaurants and eateries stay open all night. Fairs are set up in numerous parks and public spaces. The roads become overcrowded with hundreds of thousands of devotees, revellers and pandal-hoppers visiting the pandals on Puja days. The number of crowd is estimated to be a few million on the festive days and nights, possibly the second largest annual human congregation after the Hajj. It creates a chaotic traffic condition and vehicular movement comes to a standstill in many places. Elaborate security arrangements are made by Kolkata Police and additional personnel are deployed to prevent any untoward incident as well as to maintain crowd movement. Trains, buses, taxis and other modes of transport operate for whole night as crowds pour into the city from nearby districts and towns.
The festival is celebrated with shopping and gift-giving - usually new clothes, family and other social gatherings, communal feasting and different cultural performances. Modern day Puja celebrations also include reading special Pujabarshiki magazines, going out for a tour, watching movies and special programmes on TV, preparing special food items or dining out during the Puja holidays.
On Bijaya Dashami, the day of the festival, people bid adieu to goddess Durga offering her sweets and sindoor. Before bidding adieu to the goddess, the married women assemble near the idol, apply vermilion on her feet or forehead and then smear vermillion on each other. This is a part of the last celebration before the idols are taken out in grand processions of song, dance, music and then immersed in the waters. The idol immersion ceremony continues for the next few days. People distribute sweets and visit their friends, family members and relatives to exchange the Bijoya greetings.

Kali Puja & Diwali
Kali Puja which coincides with the North Indian festival of Diwali is a major festival of West Bengal, and probably the second largest after Durga Puja. Goddess Kali is worshipped at night in thousands of pandals, homes and temples. Kali Puja is light-up night for Bengal as well as for Kolkata. People decorate their homes with diyas, candles and lights and draw colourful rangolis on the floors of their homes. Children and adults burst firecrackers and burn sparklers throughout the night. A large number of devotees visit the temples to offer prayers to the goddess and animals, especially goats are sacrificed in some places. Two days after it is Bhai Phonta or Bhatri Dwitiya which is virtually the brother's day. On Bhai Phonta, the sisters fast in the morning till they put a mark of sandalwood paste on their brothers' foreheads and treat them with gifts and delicacies. While doing so, they pray to God for the sound health, safety and prosperity of their brothers. The brothers in return present gifts to the sisters.

Saraswati Puja
Saraswati Puja, a festival honouring the goddess of learning and arts, is celebrated with domestic pujas, and familial gatherings in Kolkata on a date between the last week of January and the middle of February. The day is sacred to Saraswati, goddess of learning whose worship is celebrated with great splendor mainly by students and artists. Books are often worshipped in lieu of the clay image of the Goddess. Girl worshipers usually wear saffron and yellow-coloured cloths. The puja is especially celebrated in schools and other educational institutes. It gives an chance of free-mixing among school kids. This is the equivalent of Valentine's Day to them. The typical bhog which accompanies the Puja depends dramatically on whether the family is initially from West Bengal (or ghoti) or from East Bengal — now Bangladesh —(or bangal). Ghotis have vegetarian fare, while bangals offer paired Ilish fishes to the goddess and then consume it.

Dol Yatra
The North Indian festival of Holi, is celebrated, and is supposedly coincident with the advent of spring. Holi in Bengal is known as Dol Yatra but Holi is not a Dol Yatra locally known as the festival of colors. The celebrations start in the city with the burning of Holika bonfire on the night before Holi which is known as ""Nera Pora"" in local. In this occasion Lord Krishna and Goddess Radha is worshipped. It is also the auspicious birth Tithi of 16th-century Vaishnav Saint Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. The festival of colours involves throwing, sprinkling and smearing powdered colour (aabir), and water colour (jal rang) on others. Passersby are often drenched by coloured water balloons, and celebrations often get rowdy and rambunctious, with the men partaking in the intoxicating drink of shiddhi (bhang), often laced with the stronger charas. Nowadays, a Holi party usually means frolicking dance and various delicacies like sweets and beverages.

Etymology
The word gajan in Bengali comes from the word garjan or roar that sannyasis (hermits) emit during the festivities.
Alternatively, the word gajan is considered a combination of parts of two words - ga is from the word gram meaning village and jan is from the word janasadharan meaning folk. In this sense gajan is a festival of village folk.

A month long fair is held in Guptipara on the occasion of the festival. Every year thousands of devotees take part in the festival.

History
The year when the rathayatra started is not clear. According to some sources, the rathayatra is more than 400 years old. According to other sources, the rathayatra started somewhere between 1735 and 1740. According to another source Swami Madhusudanananda of Shree Shree Vrindavan Chandra Jiu Math started the rathayatra in the year 1740. In 1858, one lakh devotees participated in the bhandara loot, according to Swami Govindananda Puri of Shree Shree Vrindavan Chandra Jiu Math. In 1873, Swami Prithananda, the dandiswami of Shree Shree Vrindavana Chandra Jiu was run over during the rathyatra in an accident. Following that incident, the number of shikharas of the ratha was reduced from thirteen to nine. Every year devotees from the districts of Burdwan, Nadia, Howrah and North 24 Parganas visit Guptipara to see the rathayatra.

Chariot
The present ratha or the chariot is a wooden Nabaratna temple having nine shikharas. The framework of the ratha is made of Shorea robusta hardwood. The ratha has a square base measuring 34 feet by 34 feet. It is four storied, having a height of 36 feet. The ratha is fitted with 16 wheels made from Vachellia nilotica hardwood. It has four ropes in the front, each 300 feet long which are used for pulling the ratha forward. There is one more rope at the back which acts as a brake. One of the front ropes is reserved for women.
The present ratha is the same chariot that was being used in the first year of the rathayatra. It is nearly 280 years old. During the entire year the ratha is kept inside a giant metallic cage. Weeks before the festival it is brought out and prepared for the festival. As of 2012, the chariot was in a dilapidated condition. The Guptipara Shree Shree Vrindavan Chandra Jiu Math have been providing patch work to the current structure every year as a stop gap solution. They have approached the district administration and the Archaeological Survey of India for repair.

Procession
The procession starts from Guptipara Shree Shree Vrindavan Chandra Jiu Math and proceeds towards Gundicha house in Gosainganj Barabazar, about 1.5 km away. The distance covered is said to be the second longest among the rathayatras held in India.

Bhandara loot
The mbhandara loot event is held on the day before the mpurnayatra or the ulto rath. According to Binay Ghosh, this event is a folk event and has nothing to do with the scriptures. On that day the worship of the deity is held behind closed doors at mashir bari or Jagannath's aunt's place. After the worship, huge quantities of prasada is offered to the deity. The prasada consists of khichuri made of Gobindo bhog rice, labra a mixed vegetable dish, a paneer dish, brinjal and pumpkin fries, payesh, malpoa, khir, chhana, other sweets and fruits. The mprasada is kept in more than 400 malsas or earthen bowls in an adjacent store room. Each malsa contains nearly five kilograms of prasada. The devotees begin to gather outside the store room from mid day. According to Binay Ghosh, the majority of the devotees in these event are the local Gops, some of whom rehearse for the event from the morning. The priest opens all the three door of the store room at 5 pm and the devotees rush inside the store to loot the prasada. Many of the locals do not cook at home that night and even on the following day.

Legends
The legend of Jagaddhatri is inspired from a tale in the Kena Upanishad. In the Katyayani Tantra, the following legend is told. After the goddess Durga killed Mahishasura, the gods of Svarga forgot about her powers. So, in order to test them, Parvati appeared before the gods Agni, Vayu, Varuna, and Chandra, who considered themselves invincible and were engulfed by ahamkara (ego). She asked them to move a tiny blade of grass. Vayu failed to pluck it; Agni failed to burn it. Every god failed at the task. In the end, they understood that the Goddess is the source of all power in the universe; even theirs. The goddess appeared before them as Uma, riding on a lion. The goddess is equated with Brahman in the narrative. The goddess gave the ego of the gods the form of an elephant. Jagaddhatri is depicted sitting on a lion with an elephant under them. The elephant, symbolizing ahamkara, lies under the paws of her vahana the lion, who symbolises courage, valour and the strength to overcome any challenges, including one's internal struggles with the Shada Ripus (""the six enemies"").
Her dhyana mantra describes her weapons, vahana and her iconography. She is sitting atop a lion, wearing different jewelry, in her four hands Devi holds bow, arrow, chakra and Samkha. She is reddish like the rising sun and she is wearing a snake garland. Her reddish colour and weapons are the symbols of raja guna but this is not for destruction and going to war. Rather this is to keep the world focused on Ritam & Satyam.
In her stotram (Jagadhatri Strotram), she has been invoked as Adhara bhutah, Dhritirupah, Dhurandharah, Dhruvapadah, Shaktistah, Shaktirupah, Shaktacharpriyah, Shaktivigrahe. ""You must believe in the Ishwara rupa. Do you know the meaning of Jagadhatri rupa? She is carrying the world. If she stops then the world will get destroyed"" is said by Sri Ramakrishna.
She sustains the universe through her Yoga shakti. Naga/Sarpa is the symbol of Yoga & Upavitam is the symbol of Bramhin. Devi is yogini. She is using the world through her maha yoga shakti. The act of rescuing the world is her lila. It is said that she had killed the elephant demon, Kurandrasura. Its mention is not found in her dhyana mantra but in her idol an elephant is seen below her mount lion, who is none other than Kurandrasura.

History of worship
There are variations regarding the history of worship of the goddess in Bengal. The popular narrative states that the worship was begun by Maharaja Krishnachandra of Krishnanagar, Nadia. However, as per local history, the worship of goddess Jagatdhatri was first established  by Chandrachur Tarkamani of Santipur who made an idol of the goddess at the behest of Raja Girishchandra. At the time only ghat puja was conducted at Krishnanagar, Nadia in Bengal. Idol worship of the goddess was initiated in the village of Bramhasason, which is located in Haripur in Santipur, Nadia. Furthermore, the Jaleshwara temple of Shantipur (1665) and Raghaveshwara Temple (1669) have the idol of the goddess inside the sanctum sanctorum as well as carved on the temple walls. So, her worship may have been known in Nadia long before Krishna Chandra.
At Krishnanagar, Raj Rajeshwary Jagatdhatri Puja is one of the oldest in Bengal. As per local history, Maharaja Krishnachandra was arrested by Nawab Siraj-ud-Dullah once for not paying taxes on time. He was released from prison during the day of Vijaya Dashami. Having missed  the entire festivity of Durga Puja in his kingdom, Maharaja became extremely sad. Seeing her devotee sad, the ultimate mother, Goddess Jagaddhatri gave Maharaja a vision and the king commenced the ritual of Jagatdhatri Puja in his native place. The puja was performed by Raj Rajeshwary (Raj Mata in Bengali language) and before the start, a Jagatdhatri Puja was donated by Maharaja Krishna Chandra named Maa Jaleshwary at ""Malopara Barowary"". The worship of the goddess was later resumed by Sarada Devi, wife of Ramakrishna.
The Jagatdhatri puja of Bose family and Chatterjee family, Palpara and Bhavanipur, deserves a special mention in this regard. The puja of Bose family initially used to be held in their ancestral home in Murshidabad. Folklore has it that this puja was started in 1788. The puja was later shifted to its present location in Chandannagar, where many of the family members now live. The exact history of the deity is unknown, but family records date it back to 1640. In Chatterjee family this puja originates from 1700 in Srirampur which later was shifted to Chatterjee's official ancestral home in 1936 by Hari Mohan Chatterjee. For over 40 years it remained the centre of attraction during the festivities. After the demise of Hari Mohan Chatterjee the puja was continued by 3 generations by Shashanka Chatterjee, Nilanka Chatterjee (Son of Late Shashanka Chatterjee) and at present by Tirthanka Chatterjee and Ankita Chatterjee (children of Nilanka and Jayeeta Chatterjee). In 2023 the puja got shifted again for the 2nd time in 200 years to Bangalore, marking a historic shift to South of India. The Puja is continued by Chatterjees with all grandeur and tradition dating back centuries.

Researcher Mohit Roy has noted that Jagadhatri vigraha from Barisal is from the 8th Century. Currently, the vigraha is in the Ashutosh Museum (Kolkata). One must note that such Simha-Vahini vigrahas have been discovered plenty, particularly from western Bengal.
The first textual mention of Jagadhatri puja comes from Kalviveka of Smarta Shulapani, dated approximately from 1375 to 1460. Later Smartas ""Brihaspati Raymukut"" and ""Srinatha Acharya Churamani"" have mentioned the goddess in their work.
The time in which she is worshipped, Shukla Paksha of the pious month of Kartika, especially the Tithi of Navami, is very auspicious. In ancient times, it was known as Chandika Puja. According to Smritisagara and Mahamohopadhhaya Panchanan Tarkaratna, it is the day to worship Uma.
The oldest temple of the goddess is in Somra (Hooghly), also known as Mahavidya temple. It was established in 1621 CE. The worship of the goddess takes place in the Dekhuria village as well in Birbhum. Still older is the Jagadhatri puja of Baligram village (Jiaganj, Murshidabad), dated back to five hundred years ago. Bandyopadhyay family of Mirhat of Kalna are observing Jagadhatri puja for more than four hundred years. Jagadhatri puja is the main Puja of Dhatrigram, Baidyapur & Mirhat of Kalna. The 350-year-old Chandrapati family's kuladevi is Jagrata.

Festivities
Jagatdhatri Puja is very popular in Krishnanagar, Chandannagar, Tehatta, Rishra, Howrah, Bhadreswar, (Sutragarh-Santipur), Boinchi and Ashoknagar-Kalyangarh.
The beauty of the festival in Chandannagar is mainly due to the collaborative conception between the French and Bengalis. Remarkable feature remaining its procession, second largest in the world after Rio de Janeiro's, with its magnificent lightings.
The Jagadhatri puja of Krishnanagar is a visual and spiritual celebration to see. During this time the city adorns itself with lots of lights, flowers, pandals and the likes. Each year more than 5 lakh devotees come to Krishnanagar to be a part of this grandiose festival. There are about 150-175 clubs and barowaris which organise Jagadhatri puja in the city. The Jagadhatri puja of Krishnagar is a perfect blending of devotion, emotion and celebration. The most popular Jagadhatri puja is the ""Burima"" of ""Chasa Para"", which was started in 1772. This deity is called the Tirupathi of Krishnanagar. Each year the idol is embellished with 150 kg gold and 150 kg silver ornaments with more than 10 benarasis and jamdanis. Besides ""Buri Maa"", ""Choto Maa"" (the deity of Kathalpota Barowari), ""Mejo Maa"" (the deity of College Street Barowari) and ""Jaleswari"" (the idol of Malo para Barowari) are also very famous.

Jagadhatri Mela
After Ratha Yatra, Jagadhatri Mela at Bhanjpur Jagadhatri Podia, is the biggest mela of Baripada, Odisha. It is the festival of Maa Jagadhatri, Goddess of the whole world. There is an 8–15 day mela (carnival) also known as mini Bali Jatra named after Cuttack's Bali Jatra which takes place at Jagadhatri Mela Podia, Bhanjpur, near the Bhanjpur railway Station during the month of October–November. It is celebrated on Gosthastami. It is also referred to as another Durga Puja as it also starts on Asthami tithi and ends on Dashami tithi. The date of the puja is decided by the luni-solar Hindu calendar.
In 2012, the ""Sarbajanin Maa Jagadhatri Puja"" has been started from 21 November. But the mela continued from 26 November to 7 December (for the first time it was for such a long period of 13 days). As the puja was celebrating its Diamond Jubilee for completing 60 years.
In 2013, the ""Sarbajanin Maa Jagadhatri Puja"" was started on 11 November. But to commemorate the loss of Odisha, specifically Mayurbhanj district and Baripada due to Phailin and post Phailin flood, the Cultural Program and it's live telecast on Blue Sky was cancelled. Still. the ""mela"" was held from 14 to 25 November 2013.

Every year its main attraction is the Puja Torana (Pandal) and the Mela. The Pandal is decorated as a famous monument in 2011 it was a miniature of US Capitol Building, United States. This year, it is Lalitha Mahal, Mysore. From the year 2000 it has been a tradition to decorate the torana as a special infrastructure. Tajmahal in Agra, Victoria Memorial in  Kolkata, the Titanic, Lotus Temple in New Delhi, Golden Temple in Punjab and many other monuments were also mimicked in the previous years since 2000 to 2006. As a tribute to 26/11 Hotel Taj Mahal Palace & Tower, Mumbai attack victims, the torana of the year 2009 is a lookalike of that hotel.

In literature
Goddess Jagatdhatri has been mentioned in many novels by Bengali authors, poets and novelists. Goddess Jagatdhatri figures in the historical fiction Anandamath written by Bengali novelist Bankim Chandra Chatterjee. It is the same literary work from which the national song of India Vande Mataram originates. In the novel, Kali, Durga, and Jagatdhatri are depicted as three aspects of 'Bharat Mata' (Mother India) – Jagatdhatri as the mother used to be, Kali as the mother now is, and Durga as the mother will be in future. The trio of goddesses are shown as the object of worship of a group of ascetics who form the protagonists of the story.

Legend
According to a story, Jimutvahana was king of Gandharvas. He gave up his kingdom to his brothers and went to forest to serve his father. He married malayavati. Once he saw an old woman mourning. She told him that she belongs to the nagavamsha (family of snakes). Due to an oath she has to offer her only son Sankhchuda to Garuda tomorrow to feed. Jimutvahana promised to protect her only son. Next day he lay on a bed of rocks and offered himself to Garuda. Garuda came and attacked Jimutvahana with his claws. Jimutvahana stayed calm and then Garuda stopped attacking. Garuda inquired about his identity and then Jimutvahana narrated the entire story. Impressed by his kindness and benevolence, Garuda promised that he will not take any sacrifices from the nagavamsha. To cherish this legend mothers keep fast for the wellbeing of their children.
This story is similar to Nagananda (The Joy of the Snakes), a Sanskrit play written by Emperor Harsha in the 7th century CE where Vidyadara king  Jimutvahana sacrifices his life for Naga to Garuda. According to the story, Jimutaketu was king of snow clad mountain country of Vidyadhara. In his house, there was a heaven-sent wishing tree, the legecy of his forefathers. He had no son, so he asked the tree for a son. Then a child was born and he named him Jimutvahana. He was full of compassion for all living beings. He spoke to his father and asked the wishing tree to banish poverty and give wealth to men. Then the tree sent gold showers on the earth and all men rejoiced. The fame of Jimutvahana extended far and wide.
Even king Jimutaketu filled with hatred as the throne was firmly fixed by his son's glory. They wanted to seize the place where a wishing tree grows, bent on war. Then Jimutvahana gave up fighting for Thorne with relatives and left the forest with his father and mother for the Malaya mountains. This was the place of Siddha, the prince. He wished to marry his sister Malayavati with Jimutvahana and Jimutvahana married her. In the past life, Jimutvahana was Vidyadhara and Malayavati was his wife. Once he saw a woman crying. The son of women, Sankhchuda, tells him that they are Nagas and the serpent king sent him to the rock of death. Sankhachuda told him that the Garuda son of Vinata started to kill nagas after getting a nector from Vishnu, as in the past Kadru made Vinata a slave. Garuda started eating snakes. Then the king of Snakes, Vasuki, foresaw the destruction of serpents and made a pact with Garuda to send one snake each day. Jimutvahana placed himself on the rock of death. Then Garuda came and the earth began to tremble. Garuda bore Jimutvahana away with his beak and started to eat. Then rain of flowers started to fall from heaven. Garuda wondered after this incident and stopped eating Jimutvahana. Garuda tells Jimutvahana that he is not a snake but Jimutvahana tells him that he is a snake. Then Sankhachuda told him that he was a sanke and Jimutvahana was not. Garuda realised that Jimutvahana was not a snake but king of vidyadharas and filled with gulit. Jimutvahana told Garuda to not eat any snakes further. Then Garuda goes to bring the nectar from the heaven to heal the wounds of Jimutvahana and bring back the life of Snakes whose bones lies in rock. Then Guari came from heaven and sprinkled the nectar on the feet of Jimutvahana. The Garuda came and sprinkled the nectar and the snakes again became alive with clothes. Then all the snakes and the mother, father and wife of Jimutvahana came and praised him. Then Jimutvahana reigned Vidhyadhara.

The festival is especially popular in the region of West Bengal, and other places like Mithila,  
Jharkhand, Odisha, Assam, and Tripura, as well as the town of Titwala in Maharashtra, along with the neighbouring country of Bangladesh.

History
The festival of Kali Puja is not an ancient one. Kali Puja was practically unknown before the 16th century; famous sage Krishnananda Agamavagisha first initiated Kali Puja. A late 17th-century devotional text, Kalika mangalkavya, also mentions an annual festival dedicated to Kali. In Bengal during the 18th century, King (Raja) Krishnachandra of Nadia also made this puja wide spread. Kali Puja saw a surge in popularity in the 19th century, coinciding with the rise in prominence of the Kali devotee Sri Ramakrishna among Bengalis. This period marked a significant shift, as affluent landowners began to sponsor the festival extensively, leading to grander and more elaborate celebrations. Along with Durga Puja, Kali Puja is the biggest festival in Tamluk, Barasat, Barrackpore, Naihati, Sonamukhi (Bankura), Dhupguri, Dinhata,
Tapshitala. It is also famous in Bhagalpur of Bihar.

Worship
During Kali Puja (like Durga Puja) worshippers honor the goddess Kali in their homes in the form of clay sculptures and in pandals (temporary shrines or open pavilions). She is worshipped at night with tantric rites and mantras. She is prescribed offerings of red hibiscus flowers, sweets, rice, and lentils. It is prescribed that a worshipper should meditate throughout the night until dawn. Homes and pandals may also practice rites in the Brahmanical (mainstream Hindu-style, non-Tantric) tradition with ritual dressing of Kali in her form as Adya Shakti Kali and no animals are sacrificed. She is offered food and sweets made of rice, lentils, and fruits. 
However, in Tantric tradition, animals are ritually sacrificed on Kali Puja day and offered to the goddess. A celebration of Kali Puja in Kolkata is held in a large cremation ground (Kali is believed to dwell in cremation grounds). Barasat, Tamluk, Barrackpore, Naihati and Madhyamgram region of North 24 Parganas, In North Bengal: Dhupguri, Dinhata, Coochbehar is well known for their majestic pandals, lightings and Idols. Durga Puja of Kolkata is often said synonymously with Kali Puja of Barasat. The region experiences Lacs of footfalls during the days of the festival. People from different regions gather to witness the majestic pandals.
The pandals also house images of Kali's consort, Shiva, two famous Bengali Kali devotees named Ramakrishna and Bamakhepa, along with scenes from mythology of Kali and her various forms, including images of the Mahavidyas, sometimes considered as the ""ten Kalis."" The Mahavidyas is a group of ten Tantric goddesses headed by Kali. People visit these pandals throughout the night. Kali Puja is also the time for magic shows, theater, and fireworks. Recent custom has incorporated wine consumption.
In the Kalighat Temple in Kolkata, Kali is worshipped as Lakshmi on this day. The temple is visited by thousands of devotees who give offerings to the goddess. Another famous temple dedicated to Kali in Kolkata is Dakshineswar Kali Temple, where Sri Rāmakrishna performed rites.

Other celebrations
Although the widely popular annual Kali Puja celebration, also known as the Dipanwita Kali Puja, is celebrated on the new moon day of the month of Kartika, Kali is also worshipped in other new moon days too. Three other major Kali Puja observations are Ratanti Kali Puja, Phalaharini Kali Puja and Kaushiki Amavasya Kali Puja. Kaushiki amavasya Kali Puja is greatly associated with the goddess Tara of Tarapith as it is considered the day when Devi Tara appeared on earth and blessed sadhak Bamakhepa, also according to the legends on this day the doors of both the ""Naraka"" and the ""swarga"" open for some time, while Ratanti puja is celebrated on Magha Krishna Chaturdashi and Phalaharini puja is celebrated on Jyeshta Amavashya of Bengali calendar. The Phalaharini Kali Puja is especially important in the life of the saint Ramakrishna and his wife Sarada Devi, since on this day in 1872, Ramakrishna worshipped Sarada Devi as the goddess Shodashi. In many Bengali and Assamese households, Kali is worshipped daily.

Summary of the ritual
This festival celebrated for good harvest. Nine type of seeds planted in basket such as rice, wheat, corn etc which is called Jawa. Girl take care of these seeds for 7–9 days. In festival girls fast throughout day.
In the ritual, people go to the jungle accompanied by groups of drummers and cut one or more branches of the Karam tree after worshiping it. The branches are usually carried by unmarried, young girls who sing in praise of the deity. Then the branches are brought to the village and planted in the center of the ground which is plastered with cow-dung and decorated with flowers. A village priest (Pahan or Dehuri according to region) offers germinated grains and liquor in propitiation to the deity who grants wealth and children. A fowl is also killed and the blood is offered to the branch. The village priest then recites a legend to the villagers about the efficacy of Karam puja. After puja, in the next morning the karam branch immersed in the river.
The festival is observed in two ways. Firstly, it is commonly held by the villagers on the village street and the expenses on liquor etc. are commonly borne. Alternatively, it is celebrated by a man in his courtyard under his patronage to which he invites all. Even people who come uninvited listening to the sound of drums are also entertained with liquor.

Details
The Karam festival is celebrated usually on Bhado Ekadashi, on the eleventh day of the bright full moon (Purnima) of the month of Bhado (August–September). In some parts of jharkhand it was also celebrated in November. The Karam tree, scientifically named Nauclea Parvifolia is the center of the proceedings of the festival. The preparations for the Karam festival begin around ten or twelve days before the festival. Nine type of seeds planted in basket such as rice, wheat, corn etc which is called Jawa. Girl take care these seeds for 7–9 days.
The morning of the Karam festival begins with women pounding rice in the dheki, a wooden implement, to obtain rice flour. This rice flour is used to make a local delicacy which can be sweet as well as salty. This delicacy is cooked in the morning of the Karam festival for consumption, and shared throughout the neighborhood.
Then the people begin the ritual dance with a yellow bloom tucked behind their ear. A branch of the Karam tree is carried by the Karam dancers and passed among them while they are singing and dancing. This branch is washed with milk and rice beer (Tapan). Then, the branch is raised in the middle of the dancing arena. After reciting the legend - the story behind the worshiping of Karam (Nature/God/Goddess) - all the men and women drink liquor and spend the entire night singing and dancing; both are essential parts of the festival, Which is known as Karam Naach.
Women dance to the beat of drums and folk songs (siring). The Puja is followed by a community feast and the drinking of hariya. The next day, the Karam tree is sprinkled with curd of the seas and immersed in the river bed.

Philosophy
Karam is a harvest festival. The festival also has a close link to nature. People worship trees during this festival as they are a source of livelihood, and they pray to mother nature to keep their farmlands green and ensure a rich harvest. It is believed that the worship for good germination increases the fertility of grain crops. Karam Devta (the God of power, youth and youthfulness) is worshiped during the festival. The devotees keep a day-long fast and worship the branches of karam and sal. Girls celebrate the festival for welfare, friendship and sisterhood by exchanging a jawa flower.

Story behind the celebration
There are multiple versions of the story behind the origin of Karam Puja. Anthropologist Hari Mohan writes that after the rituals are over, the karam story is narrated to boys and girls. The story behind the festival, according to Mohan, is this:

Once upon a time there were seven brothers who labored hard at agriculture work. They had no time even for lunch; therefore, their wives carried their lunches to the field daily. Once it so happened that their wives did not bring the lunches for them. They were hungry. In the evening they returned home and found that their wives were dancing and singing near a branch of the karam tree in the court yard. This made them angry, and one of the brothers lost his temper. He snatched the karam branch and threw it into the river. The karam deity was insulted; as a result, the economic condition of their family continued to deteriorate and they were brought to the point of starvation. One day a Brahman (priest) came to them, and the seven brothers told him the whole story. The seven brothers then left the village in search of the Karam Rani. They kept on moving from place to place and, one day, they found the karam tree. Subsequently, they worshiped it and their economic condition began to improve.
Among the Bhumijs and the Oraons the legend is that there were seven brothers living together. The six oldest used to work in the field and the youngest stayed at home. He was indulging in dance and songs round a karam tree in the courtyard with his six sisters-in-law. One day, they were so engrossed in dance and song that the brothers' morning meal was not carried to the field by the wives. When the brothers arrived home, they became agitated and threw the karam tree into a river. The youngest brother left home in anger. Then evil days fell on the remaining brothers. Their house was damaged, the crops failed, and they virtually starved. While wandering, the youngest brother found the karam tree floating in the river. Then he propitiated the god, who restored everything. Thereafter he returned home and called his brothers and told them that because they insulted Karam Devta, they fell on evil days. Since then the Karam Devta has been worshipped.
Another legend prevalent among the Pauri Bhuiyans is that a merchant returned home after a very prosperous voyage. His vessel was loaded with precious metals and other valuables which he had brought from distant lands. He waited in the vessel to be ceremoniously received by his wife and relatives, as was the custom. As it was the day of the Karam festival, all the women were engrossed with dancing and the men with playing the drums, so no one came to receive him. The merchant became furious with them. He uprooted the karam tree and threw it away. Then the wrath of Karam Devta fell on him. His vessel immediately sank in the sea. The merchant consulted astrologers who told him to propitiate Karam Devta. He launched another vessel, set out in search of the deity, and found him floating in the sea. He propitiated him with great devotion and all his wealth was restored. From that day on, the annual festival of Karam Puja has been held. After spending the whole night with dance and songs, the people uproot the branches and carry them to nearby rivers or rivulets for immersion.

It has also been associated with the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA) movement of Bengali theatre.
The path-breaking production Nabanna of the IPTA in the 1940s, has been a motivating force in the left-tilted political approach of the next few decades on the stage where luminaries like Utpal Dutt will glow with brilliance...

History and origin
Nomenclature
In Bengali, the word Pohela (or Pahela Bengali: পহেলা), alternatively Poila (Bengali: পয়লা), means 'first' and Boishakh (or Baishak Bengali: বৈশাখ) is the first month of the Bengali calendar (Bengali: পহেলা বৈশাখ Pohela Boishakh, Pahela Boishakh, Pahale Baishak or Bengali: পয়লা বৈশাখ Poila Boishakh).

Bengali New Year is referred to in Bengali as Nobo Borsho (Bengali: নববর্ষ), where 'Nobo' means new and 'Borsho' means year.

Traditional roots
Mughal origin theory
During Mughal rule, land taxes were collected from Bengali people according to the Islamic Hijri calendar. This calendar was a lunar calendar, and its new year did not coincide with the solar agricultural cycles. According to some sources, the festival was a tradition introduced in Bengal during the rule of Mughal Emperor Akbar to time the tax year to the harvest, and the Bangla year was therewith called Bangabda. Akbar asked the royal astronomer Fathullah Shirazi to create a new calendar by combining the lunar Islamic calendar and solar Hindu calendar already in use, and this was known as Fasholi shan (harvest calendar). According to some historians, this started the Bengali calendar. According to Shamsuzzaman Khan, it could be Nawab Murshid Quli Khan, a Mughal governor, who first used the tradition of Punyaho as ""a day for ceremonial land tax collection"", and used Akbar's fiscal policy to start the Bangla calendar.
According to Shamsuzzaman Khan, and Nitish Sengupta, the origin of the Bengali calendar is unclear. According to Shamsuzzaman, it is called Bangla shon or shaal, which are Arabic (سن) and Persian (سال) words respectively, suggests that it was introduced by a Muslim king or sultan."" In contrast, according to Sengupta, its traditional name is Bangabda. It is also unclear, whether it was adopted by Alauddin Husain Shah or Akbar. The tradition to use the Bengali calendar may have been started by Husain Shah before Akbar. Regardless of who adopted the Bengali calendar and the new year, states Sengupta, it helped collect land taxes after the spring harvest based on traditional Bengali calendar, because the Islamic Hijri calendar created administrative difficulties in setting the collection date.
Some say that the current Bengali Calendar begins from the year of Hijrah, i.e., migration of Prophet Muhammad, the last messenger in Islam, from Makkah to Madinah.
The festive celebrations of the Bengali New Year can be traced back to the Bengali Muslim fishmonger community of Mahifarash in Old Dhaka. During the Mughal period, the Mahifarash were known for organising feasts and banquets at their Azimpur grounds to mark the beginning of the cultivation harvest season. This day-long feast served as a precursor to what would later be evolved into the traditional Pohela Boishakh celebration.

Vikramaditya origin theory
Some historians attribute the Bengali calendar to the 7th-century Indian king Shashanka. The term Bangabda (Bangla year) is found too in two Shiva temples many centuries older than Akbar era, suggesting that Bengali calendar existed before Akbar's time. Various dynasties whose territories extended into Bengal, prior to the 13th-century, used the Vikrami calendar. Buddhist texts and inscriptions created in the Pala Empire era mention ""Vikrama"" and the months such as Ashvin, a system found in Sanskrit texts elsewhere in ancient and medieval Indian subcontinent.
In rural Bengali communities of India, the Bengali calendar is credited to ""Bikromaditto"", like many other parts of India and Nepal. However, unlike these regions where it starts in 57 BCE, the Bengali calendar starts from 593 CE suggesting that the starting reference year was adjusted at some point.

Contemporary usage
In Bangladesh however, the old Bengali calendar was modified in 1966 by a committee headed by Muhammad Shahidullah, making the first five months 31 days long, rest 30 days each, with the month of Falgun adjusted to 31 days in every leap year. This was officially adopted by Bangladesh in 1987. Since then, the national calendar starts with and the new year festival always falls on 14 April in Bangladesh. In 2018–19, the calendar was amended again, with Falgun now lasting 29 days in regular years and to 30 days in leap ones, in an effort to more align with Western use of the Gregorian calendar. However, the date of the celebration, 14 April, was retained.
The Bengali calendar in India remains tied to the Hindu calendar system and is used to set the various Bengali Hindu festivals. For Bengalis of West Bengal and other Indian states, the festival falls either on 14 or 15 April every year. The current Bengali calendar in use in the Indian states is based on the Sanskrit text Surya Siddhanta. It retains the historic Sanskrit names of the months, with the first month as Baishakh.

From 2017 onwards, the fair lasted for six days. The key characteristic of this fair include live performances of Bengali folk music, such as baul, kirtan and Kobigan.

Background
Devendranath Tagore with twenty followers accepted the Brahmo creed from Ram Chandra Vidyabagish on 21 December 1843 (7 Poush 1250 according to the Bengali calendar). This was the basis of Poush Utsav (the Festival of Poush) at Santiniketan
A Brahma mandir was established at Santiniketan on 21 December 1891 (7 Poush 1298 according to the Bengali calendar). A small fair was organised in 1894 in connection with the establishment anniversary of the Brahma mandir, in the ground opposite the mandir. What started as a small homely Poush Mela now attracts attention of not only the people of Birbhum district but tourists from all around.
From 1894 onwards, the Poush Mela has been organized every year. However it has been put on halt for three times due to the Bengal Famine of 1943, Direct Action Day of 1946 and the COVID-19 pandemic.
In earlier days the mela (fair) was held in the ground on the north side of Brahma mandir (also referred to as glass temple). On that day, a firework display was held in earlier days after evening prayers. As the mela increased in size, it was shifted to the field in Purbapalli.

Inauguration
Poush Utsav is inaugurated on 7 Poush (around 23 December). At dawn, Santiniketan wakes up to the soft music of shehnai. The first to enter the scenario is the Vaitalik group, who go round the ashrama (hermitage) singing songs. It is followed by a prayer-meeting at Chhatimtala. Then the entire congregation moves on to Uttarayan singing songs.

Other days
Poush Mela is characterized by the live performances of Bengali folk music, especially the baul music. It includes folk songs, dances and tribal sports. Each day of this festival is filled with different activities. The last day of this fair is devoted to those who are related to Santiniketan.

The fair
Some 1,500 stalls take part in the fair. The number of tourists pouring in for the three-day fair is around 10,000. Government statistics put the daily inflow of tourists in to Santiniketan at around 3,500 per day; but during major festival such as Pous Utsav, Basanta Utsav, Rabindra Paksha,  and Naba Barsha it goes up to an average 40,000 per day or more. Obviously, many of them do stay back in Santiniketan, which has 85 lodges with accommodation for 1,650. Beside of this, room on rent can be hired for some days.
Local printed fabrics and handicrafts are available in the stalls erected during the fair. Besides materials of household interest, toys are also available here. Various food stalls are also found.

At present-day, the normal mood and customs of Arandhan festival have relaxed a lot due to the busyness of modern times. However, this festival is still widely celebrated in rural areas as well as Kolkata's suburbs areas.

Festival
Ranna Puja is celebrated twice a year in West Bengal. Once on Sankranti in month of Bhadro alongside Mansa Puja typically on the day of Vishwakarma Puja and the other one on Shitalashashti the day after Sripanchami or Saraswati Puja in month of Magh.

Types of practice
An integral part of Manasa Puja is the Arandhan or Ranna Puja. Depending on the place in West Bengal, the Manasa and Ashtanag Puja begins on any Saturday or Tuesday and on every fifth day from Naga Panchami during the Bhadro month of Bengali calendar, and on Bhadro Sankranti, Manasa and Ashtanag Puja are completed and Bisarjan is performed. On that occasion Ranna Puja is celebrated on Sankranti as a ritual. This Ranna Puja is also known as Bhadre Rendhe Ashvine Khaoa Utsab.

Hindu housewives keep Manasa pots with branches of shaluk (Nymphaeaceae) and fanimana trees in a place in the kitchen for the welfare of the family and to get rid of the fear of snakes. On the eve of the puja, a portion of the various dishes is offered to the deity, that were cooked the day before. But the main ritual of this festival is to offer the best vegetables and fish of the season to the deity. Panta bhat is notable among stale foods. Those who are vegetarians have vegetarian cooking in their homes. But non-vegetarian cooking is prevalent in most households. Ilish and shrimp are one of the seasonal fish among non-vegetarians.

People throng to have a share in pulling the long ropes (Rosshi) attached to the chariots of Lord Jagannath, Balarama and Subhadra on the journey from the temple to Mahesh Gundicha Bari (or, Masir Bari) and back within 8th day.

History
Raja Manohar Roy of Sheoraphuli  donated land and entrusted Jagannathpur Mouza in service of Lord Jagannath, the initial Mandir was built in Mahesh by the King of Sheoraphuli as it fell under his territory.
It was the fourteenth century. Drubananda Brahmachari, a great Bengali sage went to Puri for pilgrimage. He had a desire to offer Lord Jagannath ‘Bhoga’ with his own hand. But the Temple authority prevented him do so. Broken-hearted Drubananda decided to fast until death. On the third day, he heard the Lord’s voice in his dream, “Drubananda, go back to Bengal. At the bank of Bhagirathi, you will find a place called Mahesh. There I shall send you a huge Daru-Brahma (Neem trunk). Make Balarama, Subhadra and my Idol with this trunk. I am eager to have ‘Bhoga’ in your hand.” So Drubanada returned to Mahesh and started his Sadhana. Then in a scary rainy night, that Daru-Brahma appeared at Mahesh. He jumped into the water and received it. Then he made the Idols of the Holy Trinity and established a Temple.
After taking sanyas, Sri Chaitanya left for Puri. In the way, he reached at Mahesh. After visiting Drubananda’s Temple, he lost his sense, and absorbed in deep Samādhi. Sri Chaitanya christened Mahesh as 'Naba Nilachal' meaning the 'new Puri'. Later old Drubananda requested him to take charge of the temple. On his request he made Kamalakar Piplai, the fifth of his twelve Gopalas, the sebait of the temple. After few days Dhrubananda died.
Kamalakar Piplai was, as it is mentioned earlier, fifth of the twelve Gopalas of Sri Chaitanya. He was the son of the Zamindar of Khalijuli in Sunderbans. He came to Navadwip to study Logic. Later he became a favorite of Mahaprabhu and joined his ministry. He was the first of the 64 Mohantas. After taking the charge of Mahesh Temple, he remained there and it is he who started the famous chariot festival, more than 600 years ago. His heirs still lives in Mahesh and some in Kolkata as the Sebait or ‘Adhikary’ of the Temple.

Chariot
But nor the Ratha neither the Temple of Kamalakar has existed. The modern Temple was made by Nayanchand Mallik of Pathuriaghata, Kolkata in 1755. It cost Rs. 20,000.
Nothing about the first Ratha is known. Once a devotee of Baidyabati donated a ratha to the Temple. In 1797, Sri Ramakrishna’s famous disciple Balarama Basu’s grandfather Krishnaram Basu donated another Ratha. His son Guruprasad Basu renewed the Ratha in 1835. But after some years the Ratha was burnt. Then Kalachand Basu made another in 1852. But one day a person committed suicide inside the Ratha. Taking this as a sign of evil, Biswambhar Basu made a different Ratha in 1857, but it also got burnt. Then Dewan Krishnachandra Basu ordered an Iron-Chariot from Martin Burn This Ratha is still inexistent.
The present ratha or the chariot was constructed under the patronage of Krishnaram Basu by the Martin Burn Company in 1885. The cost of the construction was two million rupees. The ratha is a Nabaratna temple having nine shikharas. The ratha has a steel framework with wooden scaffolding. It is fitted with twelve iron wheels each measuring twelve inches in circumference. The ratha is four storied, measuring 50 feet in height and 125 tonnes in weight. Two copper horses are attached to the front.

Festival
The snanayatra is held on the full moon day preceding the rathayatra. On the day of snanyatra, the idols of Jagannath, Balaram and Subhadra are bathed in generous quantities of milk and Ganges water. It is believed that the idols suffer from fever due to the heavy bath. So three physicians, one each from Arambag, Goghat and Ghatal are summoned to treat the deities. They offer a liquid mixture as the medicine, which are then administered on the idols. Gradually their fever lapses and they regain normal health.
Unlike the idols in Puri's Jagannath temple which are changed every twelve years, the same idols prepared by the founder Kamalakar Pipilai is used till date. However, two days after the snanayatra and just two weeks before the rathayatra, the angaraga ceremony is held. This is a three-day ceremony where the idols are repainted using herbal pigments behind closed doors. The artist covers his face and hairs while painting the idols and has only one vegetable meal a day for three days. He doesn't charge any money for the services.
A day before the rathayatra, Jagannath is sworn in as the king. On the day of the rathayatra, the Jagannath idol placed on the highest storey of the ratha. The idols of Balaram and Subhadra are also placed in the ratha. A neelkantha bird is brought and made to sit at the topmost shikhara of the chariot. When the bird flies away the procession starts.
This festival is not only the oldest but also the biggest Ratha Jatra in Bengal. Nearly 2-3 lakh people come to see the month-long fair. Lord goes to Gundicha Temple and remains there till Punarjatra, or Ultorath, as it is popularly known in Bengal.
Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, his wife Sarada Devi, dramatist Girish Chandra Ghosh and others came to visit the famous fair of the lord.

In popular culture
Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s famous novel ‘Radharani’ consists of a wonderful description of Mahesh Rathayatra. Radharani, the little heroine of the novel got lost in the fair, and then found by her future lover. Bankim’s description does not only gives a vivid picture of the festival but also it gave the fair a romantic literary charm. It is said that even today one can feel the brokenhearted girl’s sorrow.

The festival is observed in the month of Kartika in Kartika Purnima (the full moon day of Kartika month) of Hindu calendar, which corresponds to November in the Gregorian calendar. After the grandeur of Durga Puja and Kali Puja, Rash festival is celebrated as a continuation of devotion of Shakti traditions of Hinduism. While Durga Puja focuses on the worship of Goddess Durga—the embodiment of strength, protection, and cosmic balance—the Ras festival emphasizes devotion to Shakti, the divine feminine energy that manifests in various forms, such as Durga, Kali, Lakshmi, and others.
The main features of Shakta Ras are to make large clay idols (murtis) to worship Shakti. The craftsmanship involved in creating the clay idols of the Shakta deities, their religious connotations, and the artist's perfect portrayal combine to give this festival a unique character.

Historical groundings
Ras festival mainly part of Vaishnavism. During the time of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Rash Yatra was started in Nabadwip as a Vaishnava festival. While the Ras festival primarily centers around Vaishnavism, commemorating Lord Krishna's divine play, the Shakta Ras reflects a unique integration of Shakta (Goddess-centric) traditions within the Ras celebrations. This syncretism is evident in the worship practices, where deities from both Vaishnava and Shakta traditions are honored, and in the transformation of the festival over centuries. Over time, the Shakta elements gained prominence, showcasing the coexistence of Vaishnava and Shakta beliefs in the local culture.
In the introductory phase, the Ras festival was celebrated through the worship of pot (painted scrolls). Because of this, Raas Purnima became known among Shaktas as ""Pot Purnima"". But as potters from other regions—especially under the patronage of local royalty, such as Maharaja Krishnachandra, settled in Nabadwip, clay idol worship gradually took root. However, Mohit Ray has mentioned, ""The potters of Krishnanagar flourished under the patronage of British officials."" Over time, after the period of pot worship, the practice of clay idol worship gradually emerged. This led to the creation of massive and highly detailed clay idols, including both Krishna and Kali figures, with the latter earning the festival name “Ras Kali” puja in popular language.

Kali puja and Ras festival
Before the beginning of the Shakta Rash Utsav, several Kali idols were already being worshipped in Nabadwip. According to various schools of Shakta tradition, Bengal has historically been a center for Tantric practices. As the influence of Brahmanical culture grew, oppressed people began embracing Tantra closely. From the 12th to 13th century, Tantric practices expanded widely across Bengal. During this time, accomplished Tantric practitioners devotedly worshipped the goddess, following strict rules and principles. According to tradition, idol worship hadn’t become prominent in Bengal back then. In the 17th century, after the renowned Tantric scholar of Nabadwip,  Krishnananda Agamavagisha composed the Brihat Tantrasara, the worship of Kali began to spread in Bengal. However, from the ''Kālīsaparyāvidhi'', a text written in 1768 in the mid-18th century, it refers that Kali worship had not yet spread widely in Bengal. Under the direct patronage of Maharaja Krishnachandra, the widespread expansion of Kali worship took place in this region.  Krishnachandra introduced at least three Kali worship rituals in Nabadwip during his reign. These include the Alaniya Kali, Baro Shyama Mata, and the Bhadra Kali mata of Charichara Para. Later, his grandson Ishan Chandra initiated several more Kali worships, such as Bhadra Kali of Harisabha Para, and Nritya Kali of Byadra Para. Initially, these Kali goddesses were worshiped on the Amavasya (new moon) night of Dipanwita Kali Puja. However, with the beginning of Shakta Ras, these Kali pujas also started being celebrated on the Purnima (full moon) night of the month of Kartik. These pujas lend antiquity to the Shakta Ras festival of Nabadwip..

Conflict with Vaishnavism
In the early 16th century, some Vaishnavite scholars started the Vaishnavic movement. So it was an obvious conflict with Shakta followers who were worshipping Tantra.

Ras Purnima in early days
Documentation of early days of Shakta ras is very rare as flood and earthquake hit several times. Although Girish Chandra Basu and Kanti Chandra Rari gave glimpse of Shakta ras in early days.

Girish Chandra Basu
Girish Chandra Basu highlighted the first glimpse of Nabadwip Ras. In 1853–1860, he was a daroga of Nabadwip-Shantipur and Krishnanagar. In his book Sekaler Daroga Kahini (published 1888 AD), he wrote various socio-cultural reports along with the geographical location of the Nabadwip of that time. He wrote,

During Ras Utsav, people gathered in Shantipur, and similarly, large crowds would come to Nabadwip to witness the ""Pot Puja"" and enjoy various cultural programs. This Pot Puja is well-known in Nabadwip. Despite its name, Pot Puja involves worship through clay idols of various deities. Among these, idols of Durga, Bindhyabasini, Kali, Jagadhatri, and Annapurna are especially popular. These idols are very lightweight; five or six people can easily carry them on their shoulders, and they can even dance with them effortlessly.

Girish chandra Babu's description provides insight into the 19th-century Ras Utsav. Bindhyabasini Mata was worshiped in Purangunge, a place that now lies in ruins. Between 1853 and 1860, he observed Purangunge in its original state. However, in 1871, the Ganges eroded the area, leading to the destruction of Purangunge. The Bindhyabasini deity was then moved to Sribasangan. Due to internal conflicts, the puja committee eventually split into two groups. One group continued to worship Bindhyabasini in Sribasangan, while the other began Gourangini worship near Jognathtala.

Kanti Chandra Rarhi
Historian Kanti Chandra Rarhi also wrote about Nabadwip Ras in his book Nabadwip Mahima. There he confirmed that Shakta Ras jatra had been celebrated since long year back. He wrote,

Superpower of Hindu mythology, Devi Bhagabati has been worshipped in different form in Nabadwip during Ras Purnima. Next day after puja, people from the nearest place came to watch idols. Also Maharaja of Nadia came to see and he encouraged this festival by giving award for making outstanding idol. For that purpose an organising committee brought there idol in Poramatala. There Maharaj judges the structure of idol, ornaments (called in Bengali as ""Saj [সাজ]"") etc and then decided the award to best one.

Glory of the Mūrtis
The craftsmanship of the potters of Nabadwip-Krishnanagar is equally renowned both domestically and internationally. The artisans of Nabadwip have left a unique mark in creating massive idols.
Cartoonist Chandi Lahiri remarked about the glory of the Mūrtis worshiped in Nabadwip Rash jatra,

In the idols of Nabadwip, the preservation of balance within each part, even amidst their enormity, and the realization of various deities' classical imagery through clay, are simultaneously a marvel and a source of pride for any country in the world.

Dr. Sudhir Chakraborty, educationalist and recharcher of Bengali Folk culture, wrote about the potters of Nabadwip - ""The sculptor's skill in shaping the statue's form is beyond question... In this formation lies the pride of ancestral heritage, passed down through generations.""
The skill of the potters in crafting extremely large idols is beyond question. While the potters of Krishnanagar excel at creating small figurines, they cannot craft such large idols. The potters of Chandannagar can create massive Jagaddhatri idols, but they lack proportional harmony, often concealed by the extravagance of ""Daker Saj"" (Sholapith) decorations. In Nabadwip, however, all clay idols are proportionate, well-structured, and graceful. This artistry reflects the pride of a long-standing, inherited mastery in traditional craftsmanship.

The Vasant Utsava (festival) on Panchami is celebrated forty days before spring, because any season's transition period is 40 days, and after that, the season comes into full bloom.

Nomenclature and date
Vasant Panchami is celebrated every year on the fifth day of the bright half of the Hindu lunisolar calendar month of Magha, which typically falls in late January or February. Spring is known as the ""King of all Seasons"", so the festival commences forty days in advance. It is generally winter-like in northern India, and more spring-like in central and western parts of India on Vasant Panchami, which gives credence to the idea that spring is actually in full bloom 40 days after the Vasant Panchami day.
The festival is particularly observed by Hindus in the Indian subcontinent, notably India and Nepal.  In southern states, the same day is called Sri Panchami.
On the island of Bali and the Hindus of Indonesia, it is known as ""Hari Raya Saraswati"" (great day of Saraswati). It also marks the beginning of the 210-day long Balinese Pawukon calendar.

Hinduism
Saraswati Puja
Vasant Panchami is a festival of Hindus that marks the beginning of preparations for the spring season. It is celebrated by people in various ways depending on the region. Vasant Panchami also marks the start of preparation for Holika or Holi, which occur forty days later. For many, Vasant Panchami is the festival dedicated to goddess Saraswati who is their goddess of knowledge, language, music, and all arts. She symbolizes creative energy and power in all its forms, including longing and love. The season and festival also celebrate the agricultural fields' ripening with yellow flowers of mustard crop, which Hindus associate with Saraswati's favorite color. People dress in yellow saris or shirts or accessories, share yellow-colored snacks and sweets. Some add saffron to their rice and then eat yellow cooked rice as a part of an elaborate feast.
Many families mark this day by sitting with babies and young children, encouraging their children to write their first words with their fingers, and some study or create music together. The day before Vasant Panchami, Saraswati's temples are filled with food so that she can join the celebrants in the traditional feasting the following morning. In temples and educational institutions, statues of Saraswati are dressed in yellow and worshiped. Many educational institutions arrange special prayers or pujas in the morning to seek the blessing of the goddess. Poetic and musical gatherings are held in some communities in reverence for Saraswati.
In Eastern India, primarily in the states of West Bengal, Assam, Tripura and Bihar, as well as in Nepal, people visit Saraswati temples and also worship Goddess Saraswati at home (Saraswati Puja). In West Bengal, it's one of the major festivals for Bengali Hindus and observed by many households; most schools arrange Saraswati puja for their students on their premises. In Bangladesh too, all major educational institutes and universities observe it with a holiday and a special puja.
In the state of Odisha, the festival is celebrated as Basanta Panchami/Sri Panchami /Saraswati Puja. Homas and Yagnas are done in schools and colleges across the state. Students celebrate Saraswati puja with great sincerity and fervor. Usually, children four and five years old start learning on this day in a unique ceremony named 'Khadi-Chuan' or 'Vidya-Arambha'. This is alternatively known as ""Haate-Khori"" among Bengali Hindus.
In southern states such as Andhra Pradesh, the same day is called Sri Panchami where ""Sri"" refers to her as another aspect of the one goddess Devi.

Other deities
Another legend behind Vasant Panchami is based on the Hindu god of love called Kama. Pradyumna is Kamadeva reborn as Krishna's son. Thus Vasant Panchami is also known as ""Madana Panchami"". Pradyumna is the son of Rukmini and Krishna. He awakens the passions of the earth (and its people) and thus the world blooms anew.
It is remembered as the day when the Seers (Rishis) approached Kama to wake up Shiva from his Yogic meditation. They support Parvati who is doing a penance to get Shiva as husband and seek Kama's help to bring Shiva back from his meditation to worldly desires. Kama agrees and shoots arrows, made of flowers and bees, at Shiva from his heavenly bow of sugarcane in order to arouse him to pay attention to Parvati. Lord Shiva awakens from his meditation. When his third eye opens, a fireball is directed to Kama. Kama the Lord of desires is burnt to ashes. This initiative is celebrated by Hindus as Vasant Panchami.
Vasant Panchami is associated with the emotions of love and emotional anticipation in Kutch (Gujarat) and is celebrated by preparing bouquets and garlands of flowers set with mango leaves, as a gift. People dress in saffron, pink, or yellow and visit each other. Songs about Krishna's pranks with Radha, considered to mirror Kama-Rati, are sung. This is symbolized with the Hindu deity Kama with his wife Rati.
Traditionally, in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh, after bathing in the morning, people worship Shiva and Parvati. Offerings of mango flowers and the ears of wheat are traditionally made.

Deo temple: Sun God
The shrine of the Sun God in Aurangabad district, Bihar known as the Deo-Sun Shrine, was established on Basant Panchami. The day is celebrated to commemorate the founding of the shrine by King Aila of Allahabad and the birthday of the Sun-Deo God. The statues are washed and old red clothes on them are replaced with new ones on Basant Panchami. Devotees sing, dance and play musical instruments.

Other
People celebrate the day by wearing yellow (white), eating sweet dishes and displaying yellow flowers in homes. In Rajasthan, it is customary for people to wear jasmine garlands. In Maharashtra, newly married couples visit a temple and offer prayers on the first Basant Panchami after the wedding. wearing yellow dresses. In the Punjab region, Hindus wear yellow turban or headdress. In Uttarakhand, in addition to Saraswati Puja, people worship Shiva, Parvati as the mother earth and the crops or agriculture. People eat yellow rice and wear yellow. It is also a significant school supplies shopping and related gift-giving season.
In the Punjab region, Basant is celebrated as a seasonal festival by all faiths and is known as the Basant Festival of Kites. Children buy dor (thread) and guddi or patang (kites) for the sport. The people of the Punjab wear yellow clothes and eat yellow rice to emulate the yellow mustard (sarson) flower fields, or play by flying kites. According to Desai (2010), the tradition of flying kites on various festivals is also found in northern and western Indian states: Hindus in Rajasthan and especially in Gujarat associate kite flying with the period prior to Uttarayan; in Mathura (Uttar Pradesh), kites are flown on Dussehra; in Bengal kite flying takes place on Viskwakarma Puja in September. The sport is also found in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and parts of south India.
On Bali and among Indonesian Hindus, Hari Raya Saraswati (the festival's local name) is celebrated with prayers in family compounds, educational institutions, and public venues from morning to noon. Teachers and students wear brightly coloured clothes instead of their usual uniforms, and children bring traditional cakes and fruit to school for offerings in a temple.

Sikhism
Namdhari Sikhs have historically celebrated Basant Panchami to mark the beginning of spring. Other Sikhs treat it as a spring festival, and joyfully celebrate it by wearing yellow colored clothes, emulating the bright yellow mustard flowers in the fields.
Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the founder of the Sikh Empire, encouraged the celebration of Basant Panchami as a social event in the Gurdwaras. In 1825 CE he gave 2,000 rupees to the Harmandir Sahib Gurdwara in Amritsar to distribute food. He held an annual Basant fair and sponsored kite flying as a regular feature of the fairs. Maharaja Ranjit Singh and his queen Moran would dress in yellow and fly kites on Basant Panchami. Maharaja Ranjit Singh would also hold a darbar or court in Lahore on Basant Panchami which lasted ten days when soldiers would dress in yellow and show their military prowess.
In the Malwa region, the festival of Basant Panchami is celebrated with wearing of yellow dress and kite flying. In Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur, a Basant Panchami fair is held. People attend the fair wearing yellow clothes, turbans or accessories. Sikhs also remember the martyrdom of the child Haqiqat Rai on Basant Panchmi, who was arrested by the Muslim ruler Khan Zakariya Khan after being falsely accused of insulting Islam. Rai was given the choice of converting to Islam or death and, having refused conversion, was executed on the Basant Panchami of 1741 in Lahore, Pakistan.
Nihangs go to Patiala on Basant Panchami and dress in pink and yellow on the month of Vaisakh (not only Basant Panchami day).

Pakistan
Kite flying in Lahore goes back centuries. After creation of Pakistan it evolved into a highly competitive sport which is not limited to ""basant"" only. There are regional teams, competitions, and trophies. Kite And string making is an industry all over central Punjab providing livelihood to thousands.
Given the shared history and culture in the Indian subcontinent, the Punjabi Muslims in and around Lahore also celebrate kite flying as a sport in Pakistan from home rooftops during the Basant season. In 2003, the Supreme Court of Pakistan attempted to ban the manufacture, trade, and flying of kites in Lahore on the basis of fatal incidents involving 'glass-coated' stray strings originally used in kite-battles in Lahore. In 2005 Lahore announced that Vasant Panchami could be celebrated in a forest outside of Lahore. In 2017 the ban on Vasant Panchami was briefly lifted and reimposed.

Sufi Muslim Basant
According to Lochan Singh Buxi, Basant Panchmi is a Hindu festival adopted by some Indian Muslim Sufis in the 12th century to mark the grave of the Muslim Sufi saint dargah of Nizamuddin Aulia in Delhi and ever since, has been observed by the Chishti order. According to local Sufi traditions, the poet Amir Khusrau saw Hindu women carry yellow flowers to a temple on Basant and they were dressed in yellow, and he adopted their culture to give some happiness to Nizamuddin Aulia because his nephew died few days ago and he was not recovering from grief, one the Chishti order of Sufi Indian Muslims continue to practice.

Controversy
Vasant Panchami has been a historic occasion of dispute at the archaeological site of Bhojshala (Dhar, Madhya Pradesh) with evidence of an early Saraswati temple (locally called Waghdevi). On the site of Bhojshala is a later era Kamal-Maula mosque, which Muslims use for Friday prayers. The Archeological Survey of India (ASI) has provided annual guidelines, when the Vasant Panchami festival falls on a Friday, announcing hours when Hindus can worship at Bhojshala on Vasant Panchami, and when Muslims can. However, in past years, the Muslim community scheduled earlier has refused to vacate the premises, leading to riots and disorder such as in the 1980s and 1990s.
