起源
閩粵移民渡海來臺時，大多迎請海神或故鄉地方神祇之分靈嗣奉。由於移民渡海需面對莫測的海象變化，到臺墾殖後，因水土不服，瘟疫四起，又須與臺灣原住民族及不同的墾殖團體相互械鬥，爭奪土地、水源、商業利益等等，又時常危及生命財產，分靈而來的原鄉神祇，成為移民的心靈寄託，而信奉同一神明也產生了同鄉之間的意識形態認同，渡海來臺的海神、鄉土神、瘟神（王爺）等信仰，並逐步發展為無所不能的地方守護神。
除了人格化的地方守護神外，也有因為各種職業不同，而奉祀不同職業的保護神。另外主要源自道教、本來流行於泉漳一帶的正一派、閭山派道教來臺後，經過一段時間與佛教、儒教摻合，逐漸變成民間的傳統信仰及文化現象，與只求個人與家庭之「富貴財子壽」的臺灣多神格「民間信仰」。
1911年《臺灣私法》引《臺灣府誌》，列舉玉皇上帝、東嶽大帝、玄天上帝、天上聖母、神農大帝、保生大帝、三山國王、水仙尊王、開漳聖王、廣澤尊王、註生娘娘及臨水夫人、五顯大帝、中壇元帥、王爺、大眾爺、義民、城隍爺、福德正神、灶君、文昌帝君及魁星諸神皆屬儒教。1921年片岡巖的《臺灣風俗誌》也是承襲這種宗教觀，擴大了日治時期儒教宗教的範疇。
尚有一種民間信仰被專家把它歸類為「儒宗神教」，因為就其信仰內容來看，大都是藉著神明持筆揮鸞來闡述儒宗孔教的倫理道德教化，相容聖人、佛祖、神仙的三教合一思想，強調修身、齊家、行善、勸化；即以勸化世人，挽救人心，導正社會頹風惡習為宗旨。
至於基督宗教、伊斯蘭教等雖也落地生根，成為具有台灣風格的信仰，但由於其早有完整宗教體系，非屬純信仰範疇。有的則如一貫道供奉五教聖人，將其塑像奉祀，已非原基督宗教、伊斯蘭教之模式。

鄉土神簡表
臺灣是多元族群融合的社會，除了原本臺灣各族群的固有信仰以外，漢人移族方面包含了許多不同的省籍族群，他們在移居臺灣時帶來了原鄉的信仰，這些神祇稱為鄉土神。玉皇上帝、三官大帝、玄天上帝、關聖帝君、觀音菩薩、天上聖母（媽祖）、瑤池金母（王母娘娘）、城隍爺、福德正神（土地公、土地伯公）等，屬於不分祖籍共同信仰的神靈，但有些地方對某一神祇特別虔誠，有鄉土神的意味。

漳州府移民跨縣信仰：開漳聖王、輔信王公、倪府總管、廣惠尊王、保生大帝（原為泉州同安縣信仰，之後信仰遍佈整個閩南地區）、三山國王（原為廣東潮州信仰。隋開皇十一年（591年）的漳州部分地區曾屬潮州管轄，轄境為漳州梁山以南，包括平和西南地區和雲霄、東山、詔安全境，次年（592年）改隸泉州龍溪縣；唐垂拱二年設立漳州，從泉州割龍溪縣南界地成立。而《太平寰宇記》記載潮州晚至北宋仍屬廣州風俗區）
漳州府漳浦縣籍移民：古公三王

根據《重修臺灣省通志》在1981年（民國70年）的統計資料，臺灣寺廟所供奉的主祀神前二十名，依序為：王爺、觀音、媽祖、釋迦牟尼、玄天上帝、土地公、關聖帝君、保生大帝、三山國王、中壇元帥、神農大帝、清水祖師、玉皇上帝、三官大帝、開臺聖王、開漳聖王、城隍爺、孚佑帝君、王母娘娘、廣澤尊王。根據內政部2019年（108年度）的「全國宗教資訊系統資料-寺廟」，廟宇主祀神前十名，依序為：王爺、土地公、釋迦牟尼、觀音、媽祖、玄天上帝、關聖帝君、保生大帝、中壇元帥、陰神厲鬼。（陰神厲鬼為有應公、大眾爺之類，其名稱眾多，民國70年的通志統計資料有可能未併作同一類）另外，虎爺在臺灣也很常見，但大多是作為配祀神出現。
在傳統民家顯要位置的大幀神明圖像，稱為「神明彩」，通常是以觀世音菩薩為主，搭配媽祖、關聖帝君、灶神、土地公，高雄師範大學台灣歷史文化及語言研究所教授李文環表示：「這幾尊神明是台灣民間信仰裡面最受大家供奉的神。」

重大祭典與民俗活動
就信仰人口而言，台灣民間信仰是台灣最大的信仰人口。若依類別分，則佛教與道教為台灣兩大宗教。據美國國務院2003年度國際宗教自由報告中，全臺灣有454.6萬人為道教徒，其中被認定為「道教」的臺灣民間信仰，應佔大多數。該報告甚至於頁末表示，「若將崇奉祖先、巫術、鬼神和其他神靈及動物崇拜算入此信仰，臺灣民間信仰的人數更高達全國民眾的八成」。大部分台灣人同時信仰佛教與道教。這種融合佛、道的民間宗教對社會生活保持着強大的影響力，各地也有各地盛行的神明祭典。每逢這些節日皆有許多民俗活動傳承舉辦着，熱鬧者更可達兩三天甚至更久。活動更久者，例如被文化部認定為國家重要民俗文化活動的東港迎王平安祭典，每三年舉辦一科，每次祭典需歷時一週才能圓滿。

宗教聖人
一般民間廟宇多可見同時供奉「三教聖人」或三教教主，即至聖先師（儒教）、釋迦牟尼佛（佛教）、太上老君（道教）。此處宗教聖人，少有其他外來宗教如亞伯拉罕諸教的聖人，如 摩西、耶穌、穆罕默德等。但極少民間廟宇會祭祀這些一神教的神靈或聖人，因為他們一神教的信仰只能够信一個神，且無法包容或接受多神信仰。

蔣公信仰
台灣有幾座宮廟供奉蔣中正，有信眾把他尊稱為「蔣公王爺」或「中正星君」。其中，新北市淡水的魁星宮，供奉一尊「蔣公中正天尊」，神像辨識度頗高。彰化縣花壇金墩城隍廟於1975年開始供奉蔣公神位，稱為「中華禪師」。高雄市蔣公感恩堂，由觀世音菩薩作為廟內主神，蔣公則移至左側。高雄市蔣公報恩觀一樓供奉蔣公銅像，兩二樓供奉家鄉的阮弼真君、漁師大神與三官大帝。新竹縣寶山玖龍宮「老總統出巡」，身穿漢服軍裝持寶劍。新竹市天宏宮，正殿供奉一尊高3公尺的蔣公立像，頂上並懸掛「大中至正」匾額。桃園市龜山區的靈雲寺哲學廟供奉一尊高2.5公尺的蔣公立像。

源流
臺灣佛教在明清時期的根基為禪宗之臨濟、曹洞二宗。據闞正宗的研究，以臨濟的密雲圓悟及曹洞的湛然圓澄派下為代表。釋慧嚴的研究則指出，臺灣佛教在二戰以前，其法統主要源自福建的鼓山湧泉寺（曹洞宗江西壽昌慧經派，至清末民初時兼有臨濟、曹洞）、怡山長慶院（臨濟宗）、福清黃檗寺（臨濟宗）。據增田福太郎在《台灣本島人の宗教》所述，臺灣的佛教寺院皆從屬禪宗，但混合了淨土的教義，不像日本佛教那樣宗派分明。據當時文獻所述，臺灣佛教作佛事又有禪和、香花之別，「禪和派惟課誦經懺、報鐘鼓而已。香花派則鼓吹喧闐，民間喪葬多用之」。臺灣民間若延請僧人作喪事，通常會以亡者名義舉行「瑜伽燄口」，普渡孤魂。在二戰前，其燄口傳承版本，主要以福州鼓山湧泉寺、泉州開元寺等福建佛教系統為主。
在日治時期，日本政府引進日本的佛教宗派，如淨土真宗本願寺派、真宗大谷派、淨土宗、日蓮宗、曹洞宗、臨濟宗妙心寺派、高野山真言宗等，其中禪宗特別有影響力，開展出四大名山。1921年成立的南瀛佛教會，成為日本政府管理臺灣佛教的機構。
1949年後，來自中國大陸各省的僧侶（江蘇和浙江兩省佔其中的絕大多數），在臺灣恢復了中國佛教會，將出家佛教的傳戒加以制度化，不但長期主導了戰後臺灣佛教的發展，還促成「齋教」的空門化。齋教是以「在家」持齋修行為特色，融合儒、釋、道的民間教派，主要指龍華教、金幢教、先天道這三個中國秘密宗教，又以龍華教與佛教關係最密切，其宗教建築稱「齋堂」。二戰後，受到佛教及一貫道的夾合競爭，齋教因而沒落。另外，江浙佛教的僧侶也帶來其燄口傳承，來自寶華山隆昌律寺和常州天寧寺，俗稱「華山燄口」。
解嚴後的臺灣佛教，其發展日趨多元，除了漢傳佛教出現新四大名山及其他的人間佛教教團，藏傳佛教、泰緬南傳在臺亦逐漸通行，對漢傳佛教的風貌產生程度不一的影響。

特色
台灣佛教的特色之一是世俗化，例如巖仔和高僧信仰；雖然有些人對世俗化的佛教較為反感，但佛教原教旨中並沒有反對世俗化的規定。基本上戰前的傳統佛教採世俗系統（如巖仔和高僧信仰）與叢林系統（如後述之五大山頭）分開的形式，戰後的漢傳佛教系統特色則是高度入世的佛教叢林主導一切。王見川博士則認為戰前的傳統佛教，是神異僧和神佛兼祀的世俗系統，江燦騰博士的大量相關全面性研究，則完全否認戰後有所謂高度入世的佛教叢林，而主張是由兼具泛威權政治化、神異靈驗化崇拜和極為多重商業文化性質的三者或兩者特徵的高度入世叢林事業體，在主導著實際的一切發展，此外，中產階級的經濟援助、現代化傳播形態的多元運用，也顯示都市世俗教徒的相對強大影響。

歷史
早期佛教
若要瞭解臺灣本土佛教近三百年來的發展史，首先必須知道：臺灣佛教從17世紀自閩南傳來算起，雖已歷三百多年之久，但因臺灣位處大陸東南海疆的邊陲，並且與大陸接觸、交流時間較晚，所以佛教文化要深層化或精緻化，除少數個別情況外，是缺乏足夠發展條件的。相對於佛教傳入朝鮮半島（4世紀）、日本（6世紀），年代尚淺。
由於地理位置和所移墾來臺的漢人移民，都和對岸的閩、粵兩省具有密切的地緣關係。所以早期臺灣佛教史的發展性格邊陲性和依賴性，主要便是受此兩省的佛教性格所影響。此後，則是二戰後的大量各省逃難來臺移民，才發生另一波新的大陸漢傳佛教性格在臺灣的普遍化影響。
雖然在臺灣近三百多年來的佛教發展史當中，日治時代的影響只占了其中的五十年而已，但因日本佛教具有日本宗派文化的特殊性，以及高度政治化和現代化的衝擊，一旦戰後日本的政治勢力退出，改由中國的政府重新接管，在短期間之內，臺灣本土的日化僧侶，便不得不面臨再度由日本化的佛教急遽地轉成為中國化的佛教等這一類艱難適應的改變問題。而這又是和戰後六十年多來臺灣佛教的發展，最息息相關的。所以臺灣近三百多年來的佛教史，並不都是充滿歡樂和無憂的世外桃源生活史，而是帶著諸多歷史滄桑和生活無奈的艱難奮鬥史。叢林系統的佛教，則始於明鄭時期，台南竹溪寺為最早修建寺院之一。

巖仔
滿族清朝統治中國後，大力提倡藏傳佛教與漢傳佛教，因此，閩南粵東地區信仰發生重大變革，除了產生吸收佛教世俗化的福建道教閭山派之外，也衍生出適合漢人（閩南、粵東人）民情的佛教，其中觀音菩薩信仰特別興盛。18世紀之後，台灣泉州、漳州移民也大量興建觀音菩薩為主尊的佛教寺廟，此種佛寺又以巖仔居多。

巖仔，漳州人發音為（giam ah），泉州人發音為（gum ah），本來意思是山洞，後來靠近山邊的廟就都稱為巖仔。道光十六年（1836年）刊行的《彰化縣志》稱「閩省漳泉南人謂寺曰巖」，可見巖仔在當時應專指佛寺。而“巖仔”於佛寺的正式名稱又可稱為巖或岩。以巖為名的佛寺，自18世紀後大量出現於台灣，藉由觀音信仰，將佛教教義傳至台灣，例如乾隆十七年（1752年）建成的芝山巖與乾隆五十六年（1791年）整竣完成的寶藏巖等。
除了巖仔之外，台灣清治時期主祀觀音的廟宇有寺、宮、閣、堂、壇、庵、巖等等的名稱區分。其中，亭為地主所蓋，寺為大廟，堂常為村廟，巖則通常蓋於山邊。另外，道教廟宇於興建時，也常將佛教的觀音，佛祖聖像列於道觀或宮寺中，至此，臺灣佛教與道教成為不可分的密切信仰。
台灣宗教學者林美容將這些現下影響力相當深、與正信佛教多所差異的巖仔，稱為「民間佛教」，不過台灣佛教史學者江燦騰則認為巖仔僅為「民間佛教」的一部份，唯有將庵、堂、寺等相關建築一併加入探討，才能完整呈現「民間佛教」的歷史面貌。

高僧信仰
另外，明、清時代來台的移民，自閩、粵等地，帶來了許多高僧信仰，學者有人稱之「佛教俗神」信仰，如福建泉州安溪縣的清水祖師信仰、顯應祖師信仰，漳州的三平祖師信仰，汀州的定光祖師、伏虎禪師信仰，福州的泗州祖師、扣冰祖師信仰。高僧信仰亦會道教化、如道教廟宇、鸞堂也時常奉祀原屬佛教禪宗的達摩祖師、濟公禪師與普庵禪師等。但是，學者王見川則稱此類信仰內涵和特質，應改以「神異僧的靈驗崇拜」稱之才正確，兼可代替先前名實都不符的「高僧信仰」觀點。

日治時期
1895年，臺灣日治時期開始。在治理臺灣所需要的宗教扶持上，臺灣總督府捨棄19世紀末因對外戰爭勝利而興起的國家神道教，而選擇與漢人的共同信仰──佛教。這種與西方世界以基督教治理殖民地的「宗教殖民」不同的「宗教感化」思維模式，也讓漢人居多的臺灣較易接受日本統治。
20世紀初，隨著日本於台灣始治，大量日本佛教派系來台宣教，直至1945年日治時期結束前，共有八宗十四派的日本佛教支派來台傳教，其中又以真宗本願寺派發展最佳，不過較符合臺灣民情，以菩薩神化為主的曹洞宗、日蓮宗、淨土宗等佛教宗派也頗有發展。例如，曹洞宗就曾自費於台北觀音山的山路上（今凌雲路）設置沿路有三十三座石觀音像的禮佛古道（台北西國三十三所靈場）。
為因應現實環境，臺灣漢人與日人合作，並以寺廟改建、增設佛像（如地藏王菩薩）等方式於台灣各地設立許多寺院及佈教所。起初各宗派與本地佛道教傳教者，雖需為增加信徒競爭，使甲宗信徒歸向乙宗，因而其間發生少數爭執。不過臺灣佛教或民間信仰人口大增後，加上漢化且放棄原本純巫教的大量平埔族，使各佛教教派都具有一定信徒數量，在此情況下，各派「不以信徒多寡為唯一之目的，故各宗派間不再出現任何傾軋，頗為圓滑。」（溫國良編譯，《台灣總督府公文類纂宗教史料彙編》，台灣省文獻會，1999.6，頁58。）
1941年，全臺灣人口共500多萬，而光是積極參與日本佛教的信仰人口就達到8萬人。其中，仍以真宗本願寺派、曹洞宗、日蓮宗、淨土宗等派為主。
八宗十四派之八宗係指華嚴宗、天台宗、真言宗、臨濟宗、曹洞宗、淨土宗、淨土真宗、日蓮宗；十四派係指華嚴宗、天台宗、真言宗高野派、真言宗醍醐派、臨濟宗妙心寺派、曹洞宗、淨土宗、淨土宗西山深草派、真宗本願寺派、真宗大谷派、真宗木邊派、日蓮宗、本門法華宗、顯本法華宗。另外，天台宗修驗道也曾在台灣設立支部，但是布教活動不詳。

九大門派
台灣佛教的派別尚有四大法脈（大崗山派、月眉山派、觀音山派（凌雲寺派）、法雲寺派）的說法，也有人加入了開元寺派、大仙寺派、萬佛山派、清涼山派及東和寺派等，號稱九大門派。有關二戰前的臺灣佛教發展，雖然佛教史家江燦騰於1996年，首先提出四大法派之說。但這仍是延續朱麒麟和藍吉富兩者的先前看法而來。日治時期則出現七大山頭的說法，九大門派之說為後出。
江燦騰認為台灣日治時期有所謂四大法脈、四大道場。其中基隆市靈泉禪寺開月眉山派，由江善慧主持；新北市五股凌雲禪寺開觀音山派（凌雲寺派），由沈本圓主持；苗栗縣大湖鄉法雲寺創法雲寺派，由林覺力主持；高雄市大崗山超峰寺開大崗山派，由林永定等人開山。所謂法派，是傳承禪宗的臨濟宗或曹洞宗的法脈世系而有大量衍生的派下寺院者，於是宛如日本佛寺的大本山和派下末寺之別，在日治時期的臺灣本土佛教寺院中，若有發展成為大法派者，即有核心道場和隸屬道場，而四大道場，就是指上述四大法派的核心道場而說的。所以這是有嚴格定義的指涉對象，並深具時代特色者。又，四大法脈的本山有四大名山之稱。

戰後漢傳佛教
1945年第二次世界大戰因日本戰敗而結束，日本投降，撤出臺灣，臺灣進入國民政府時期。稍後的1950年代，因為國共內戰與中國共產黨不允許宣揚佛教等因素，來台定居的漢傳佛教傳道人日漸增多，其中以江浙兩省僧侶為主，之後，江浙系統的漢傳佛教主導了戰後台灣佛教的發展。1953年，大仙寺傳戒為台灣戰後舉辦首次傳大戒。不同於以往漳泉流行的較偏向世俗化的佛教，強調「無神論」的漢傳叢林佛教，在此時正式於台灣耕耘。經幾十年的宣教，佛教於1980年代中期開始於台灣流行。加上經濟發達、政治鬆綁等因素，由中國大陸傳入的漢傳大乘佛教成為佛教的新興主導力量。不但佛教信徒增多，以往從未出現的佛經謁語也大量出現於各種場合。
2015年，臺灣佛教的信徒約有820.5萬人，佔全台灣2350萬人口的35%，不過，此數字可能與道教、儒教或其他台灣民間信仰有重疊的情況。這裡面又以淨土宗、禪宗及無所屬的宗派居多。如就佛教團體規模來看，則以慈濟基金會、佛光山、法鼓山以及中台禪寺等四團體的影響力最大，被台灣佛教史家江燦騰博士列為戰後臺灣佛教四大事業道場。另外，除了上述所說的四大山頭外，還有苗栗境內的九華山大興善寺和新北市的靈鷲山無生道場。這些山頭的特色也和中國大陸傳統漢傳佛教也有所不同，有的強調禪淨雙修，有的更不再強調宗派之分，皆以「佛法生活化」為宣教重點。

其他教派
藏傳佛教
藏傳佛教於1949年隨著國民政府遷台而傳入，學者將其在台傳播依1982年卡盧仁波切或1980年創古仁波切首次來台弘法為界，分為前弘期與後弘期。前弘期受政治影響，只有少數蒙古的章嘉呼圖克圖、甘珠爾瓦呼圖克圖及康區的格賴達吉仁波切、明珠仁波切，而主要以漢籍居士或喇嘛為主導，其代表人物有：君庇亟美喇嘛〈俗名歐陽無畏〉、屈映光（法賢上師）、吳潤江（華藏上師）、劉銳之、韓同、申學文（貢噶老人）、張澄基、陳健民等。代表性的道場為南方寶生佛剎、諾那華藏精舍、金剛乘學會、貢噶精舍、白馬山菩提講堂。
後弘期則以藏僧為主導，四大教派的法王及仁波切先後抵台弘法並相繼在台成立弘法中心，使藏傳佛教成為台灣80年代以後學佛熱潮的重要一支。噶舉派最早入台，較著名的如創古仁波切、卡盧仁波切、大寶法王的四大法王子（夏瑪巴、大司徒、蔣貢康楚、嘉察）都曾應邀來台並成立弘法中心或佛學會。寧瑪派則以蔣波羅曾仁波切，貝諾法王所屬白玉傳承在台的發展最盛。薩迦派則宗薩蔣揚欽哲仁波切多次來台傳法，頗受年輕一輩的台灣學佛者之歡迎，在台設有悉達多本願佛學會。90年代末，宗薩佛學院堪布貢噶旺秋在台灣完整講授《入行論》、《善顯能仁密意》、《入中論》、《俱舍論》等，深獲好評。格魯派在台灣的發展起步較遲，圖敦梭巴仁波切來台弘法，成立「經續法林」，為國際「護持大乘法脈聯合會」組織的一員。十四世達賴喇嘛於1997年、2001年兩度來台弘法，也為藏傳佛教在台弘傳掀起高潮，並成立「達賴喇嘛西藏宗教基金會」，安排格西長期教授藏語文基礎、《菩提道次第廣論》、佛教經典等課程。而南印度三大寺（甘丹寺、哲蚌寺、色拉寺）及札什倫布寺也陸續派僧侶駐台弘法並設立佛學會。
另一方面，佛法要生根發展，需要結合當地文化與民情，藏傳佛教傳入台灣亦是如此，此即為本土化（或稱中土化、漢化）的藏傳佛教。例如，日常法師創立的福智文教基金會，提倡以儒家的思想建立十善社會，推廣《菩提道次第廣論》研討班，弘揚宗喀巴大師教法，成立慈心有機事業、里仁公司等。釋如石曾將其譽為接枝自藏傳佛教的人間佛教。又如，首位台灣籍的轉世喇嘛洛本仁波切在台南縣左鎮創建以「藏密中土化」為目標的噶瑪噶居寺也頗具影響力。

日本佛教
20世紀初，隨著日本統治台灣，大量日本佛教派系來台宣教，直至1945年日治時期結束前，共有八宗十四派的日本佛教支派來台傳教，其中又以淨土真宗本願寺派發展最大，不過較符合臺灣民情，以菩薩神化為主的曹洞宗、日蓮宗、淨土宗等佛教宗派也頗有發展。例如，曹洞宗就曾自費於台北觀音山的山路上（今凌雲路）設置沿路有三十三座石觀音像的禮佛古道（台北西國三十三所靈場）。
戰後，日本佛教各宗派因政治因素影響撤出台灣，此後的長期間因戒嚴，宗教活動受到嚴格的控制，直到1987年解嚴後，宗教信仰有了充分的自由，日本佛教才又重回台灣弘法。日本佛教有真言宗系的高野山真言宗在台灣布教，也有僧侶親自前往真言宗兩大道場之一的高野山修行。淨土真宗系則有台灣人自建道場者，也有淨土真宗親鸞會在台弘法。目前在台灣，還有創價學會、靈友會、立正佼成會、真如苑、阿含宗等類佛教之新興宗教與日蓮正宗、真言宗等傳統宗派在台弘法。
此外，臨濟宗妙心寺派和曹洞宗等宗派至今仍持續與昔日有緣之寺廟進行交流，如臨濟宗妙心寺派的臨濟護國禪寺、曹洞宗的東和禪寺、真言宗的慶修院等。其中，臨濟宗妙心寺派日僧東海亮道法師，感念曾在台灣布教的恩師東海宜誠法師，促成了「台灣三十三觀音靈場」的創設。

韓國佛教
近年韓國佛教界跟臺灣佛教都有往來，其中韓國禪宗的禪修方法與臺灣禪宗的禪修方法較不同。目前臺灣有承繼韓國禪宗法脈的圓濟惠忠禪師，於臺灣花蓮成立花蓮縣祖師禪學會，推廣韓國參究公案的禪修方式。

南傳佛教和原始佛教
近年来南傳上座部佛教和原始佛教在台灣也正逐漸傳播起来，經典典籍被翻译成中文。並有教派組織像台灣南傳上座部佛教學院推廣南傳上座部傳統禪修；原始佛教 (中道僧團)、原始佛法三摩地學會、佛陀原始正法中心推廣原始佛教傳統禪修。

左翼解放佛學
林秋梧主陳左翼解放佛學以抗當時佛教陳腐之處，其著作先後發表於《中道》、《南瀛佛教》、《臺灣新民報》及《赤道報》等刊物；其中發表於《南瀛佛教》的〈真心直說白話註解〉、〈佛說堅固女經講話〉等短篇可謂之代表作。其詩「菩提一念證三千，省識時潮最上禪；體解如來無畏法，願同弱少鬥強權！」可代表其中心思想。
林秋梧匯通左翼思想的社會主義及唯物史觀、大乘佛學的如來藏及般若思想、中國佛學的佛性論及無情有性論等，建構出解放佛學的平等觀─將極樂淨土類比於社會主義的理想社會，主張「自力的現世淨土」，倒轉宗教界所遮蔽社會經濟活動的結構問題，而應回歸到現實關懷的階級鬥爭為方法，藉此批判傳統就彼岸性的極樂淨土思想及臺灣趨炎附勢、不明就裡的迷信風氣，進而採取無抵抗的大抵抗主義來改變身邊的不公不義。

傳入臺灣
傳入臺灣的道教，傳承自福建、廣東的正一道傳統。正一道的道士家設「壇靖」，居於民間聚落，設齋醮行法事，世稱為「火居道」，這相對於出家修行，居住在宮觀清修的全真道，世稱為「出家道」。閩、粵兩省以正一道為主，隨明末清初的移民來到臺灣，泉州、漳州及粵東之客家人，均有正一道的道壇道士跟隨遷移，設壇於各移民的聚落內，已有一、二百年左右的歷史。
泉州籍優勢區的正一道壇，主要分佈區域為雲林、嘉義以南的縣市，還有其他多泉籍移民的北部區域，其中，新竹林家的林汝梅，清代時曾至龍虎山受籙學法，回臺後成立「正一嗣壇」。此派道士以齋法拔度為主，亦行吉慶醮典、作三獻，既度亡又度生。漳州南部與相鄰粵東客籍，其移民較多的分布區，主要在北部。這派為「道法二門」，平常以三奶派（閭山法）小法事為主，如祭解的補運、改運法事、禳星及安太歲、安神位；遇到寺廟慶成祈安或神明慶生，則以正一派道法舉行醮儀、作三獻，以度生為主而不度亡。據研究，「道法二門」 在臺灣是「道場」醮儀及「法場」驅邪儀式的合稱，指「天師道」和「閭山法」。在福建詔安的客家發源地，則為醮儀範疇中的道、法傳統，指「天師道」（師/張天師/龍虎山）和「混元法」（聖/北帝/武當山）。
龍虎山第六十三代天師張恩溥在1949年12月來臺，並先後成立「臺灣省道教會」與「中華民國道教會」，想要將道壇道士納入「奏職授籙制」。其後，第六十四代天師張源先也以嗣漢天師府名義繼續授籙；「道教會」則為三清弟子和道士舉行傳度之儀，並和斗堂合作，推廣二戰之後傳入臺灣的「福州禪和派」。除在福州籍中傳布，這一派也逐漸通行於部分道廟，其科儀以誦經和唱贊為主。一般認為福州禪和派的形成，源自北京任官的福州人，吸取北京白雲觀及華北全真科儀，又揉合福州當地的正一道及佛教經誦。禪和派以正一天師門下自居，傳來臺灣以崇奉斗姥為主，為人拜斗祝壽，也作度亡齋事。其道壇稱斗堂，多以「堂」為名，有別於道法二門和靈寶派道壇是以「壇」來命名。
全真道本起自內丹北派，後和南派交融，兩者合流。創教之初強調內功、外行並重，後基於傳教需要，又引進齋醮科儀之法事。二戰前，全真道在臺灣傳佈有限。二戰後，少數的全真道出家道士及在家居士因國共戰爭抵臺，傳揚全真教法，以龍門宗丹法和伍柳丹法為主。其他非全真道的臺灣丹道團體還有內丹西派丹法、隱仙派丹法、天帝教、崑崙仙宗等。兩岸交流後，也有人遠赴中國大陸，拜全真道士為師，然後回臺傳播全真道。
臺灣道教的道法傳承，沿襲自祖先的原居地，而在本地發展。除依「家傳制」由父子相傳，而少傳外姓；亦有「師受制」，拜師奏職，師徒相授。兩任張天師有意推行龍虎山的「受籙制」，但並不完全，仍多有按舊制而受籙奏職者。近年兩岸往來後，漸有組團親赴龍虎山受其法職者。除師受奏職或天師奏職外，道壇亦多登記於「道教會」名下，成為其個人會員。

台灣道教分類
正一道（天師道）
道法二門（天師道和閭山法），只做喜事
靈寶派/正一嗣壇（天師道），做喜事、喪事
福州禪和派（天師道），二戰後傳入，做喜事、喪事
全真道和其他丹道團體
根據劉枝萬的研究，臺灣的道教和民間信仰具有三種類型的神職人員：1）道士；2）法師；3）靈媒，三者具有複雜而密切的關係。道士是天師門下的各類道派或全真道等丹道團體，經由授籙或傳戒儀式而名登天曹，獲取道位的神職人員。能代天演法，主持「道場」的齋醮科儀。臺灣道士大多是在自家開設道壇的火居道士，配合地方宮廟之醮儀期程與應民眾之法事需求，提供其宗教服務。
法師則來自地方的驅邪儀式傳統。在巫覡、道教、佛教三者的交互影響之下，中國民間信仰有「法派」的法術流傳。這類法派法術，除了道教的道法系統，還混雜佛教（密教系）的「瑜伽教」（即釋教香花僧）術法傳統。巫覡採納道教及佛教之神祇名諱、科儀經典，而施行術法，形成各種法派的法術，如閭山派（陳靖姑）、瑜伽教（釋教，穢跡金剛、龍樹醫王）、普庵派（普庵禪師）、梅山教（張五郎）、法主公派（張聖君）。這些法派法術通行於湖南、江西、福建、臺灣、新加坡、馬來西亞一帶，又以閩、臺受影響最深。
靈媒指乩童、尪姨、鸞生，以及會靈山運動的靈乩等，是藉神明或靈體的憑附而代為傳達訊息的人。乩童經常作為道士的伴隨，為信眾解惑或驅魔鎮煞。在清末，又出現了以「扶鸞降筆」來傳達神意的宗教組織，其宗教建築稱為「鸞堂」，扶鸞者稱為「鸞生」、「鸞手」（跟乩童有別，是請神明降臨鸞駕，在沙盤上寫字降旨；乩童的降乩是神明直接附體而陷入附身狀態），以儒家義理教化百姓作為宗旨，自稱「儒宗神教」或「聖教」。崇奉關聖帝君、孚佑帝君、司命真君等「恩主公」的鸞堂，如臺北行天宮等，此類為恩主公信仰，另一類則為母娘信仰，如一貫道、慈惠堂等。
臺灣歷史文獻中，另有「齋教」這個以「在家」持齋修行為特色，融合儒、釋、道的民間教派，主要指龍華教、金幢教、先天道這三個中國秘密宗教，其宗教建築稱為「齋堂」。其中，金幢教、先天道最重內丹修持，而龍華教與佛教關係密切。二戰後，受到佛教及一貫道的夾合競爭，齋教已沒落。其齋堂除了轉型為佛寺，也有變成其他宗教，比如鸞堂、一貫道道場或是慈惠堂的情況。
風水師、擇日師、算命師、卜卦師等鑽研術數者，則自成一類，稱為術士。有些道士也會兼營風水、擇日、算命、看相、卜卦等一兩種或數種術數，為信眾服務。
顧廟的俗人為「廟祝」，為看顧寺廟的人，俗稱廟公、廟婆。採「管理人制」的寺廟，通常由管理人兼任，採「管理委員制」的寺廟，由管理委員會聘總幹事擔任，主要工作為總管廟務，負責廟宇的環境清潔、神明祭拜。有些廟祝可能還會解籤、卜卦、算命，或作驅邪、收驚、開光等簡單法事，不過這些宗教儀式服務也可能是由廟方聘請道士、法師常駐廟宇來提供。若是道士或僧人受聘作為寺廟的管理人，則稱為「住持」。

道教和台灣民間信仰的神明
在傳統民家顯要位置的大幀神明圖像，稱為「神明彩」，通常是以觀世音菩薩為主，搭配媽祖、關聖帝君、灶神、土地公，高雄師範大學台灣歷史文化及語言研究所教授李文環表示：「這幾尊神明是台灣民間信仰裡面最受大家供奉的神。」
各廟宇則供奉不同的「主神」，如行天宮的主神是關聖帝君，龍山寺主奉觀世音菩薩，大龍峒保安宮的主神是保生大帝。根據《重修臺灣省通志》在1981年（民國70年）的統計資料，臺灣寺廟所供奉的主祀神前二十名，依序為：王爺、觀音、媽祖、釋迦牟尼、玄天上帝、土地公、關聖帝君、保生大帝、三山國王、中壇元帥、神農大帝、清水祖師、玉皇上帝、三官大帝、開臺聖王、開漳聖王、城隍爺、孚佑帝君、王母娘娘、廣澤尊王。根據內政部2019年（108年度）的「全國宗教資訊系統資料-寺廟」，廟宇主祀神前十名，依序為：王爺、土地公、釋迦牟尼、觀音、媽祖、玄天上帝、關聖帝君、保生大帝、中壇元帥、陰神厲鬼。（陰神厲鬼為有應公、大眾爺之類，其名稱眾多，民國70年的通志統計資料有可能未併作同一類）另外，虎爺在臺灣也很常見，但大多是作為配祀神出現。
臺灣亦有一些廟宇供奉其他重要的道教神祇、仙人，如三清道祖、地母娘娘、紫微大帝、太乙天尊、斗姥元君、雷聲普化天尊、張天師等等。一些廟宇供奉的無極天尊、無極老祖、玄玄上人、無極老母、無生老母等等，則有鸞堂和中國祕密宗教（如先天道）的淵源。
至於道士作醮所用的壇場畫、掛軸，主要用在內壇，為道士作法事和迎請神靈的空間，外壇則設紙糊神像讓信眾參拜。主要的神像掛軸有三清、玉皇、紫微、三官、天師、北帝、四府（天京、地府、水國、陽間眾神）等。大致來說，內壇的儀式空間，正面為三清壇，供奉三清道祖，其左為玉皇上帝，或增掛太乙救苦天尊，右為紫微大帝，或增掛雷聲普化天尊。對面為三界壇，供奉三官大帝，其左為師壇（龍虎山），懸掛張天師，右為聖壇（武當山），懸掛玄天上帝。其間設有四大護法元帥護衛壇域，接連四府。內壇左右兩側為天京、地府、水國、陽間眾神，浮空而行，朝謁三清。具體佈置又會因所用齋醮儀式、派別傳承、特定場合需求等原因，有所增減調整。

台灣道教從60年初至今
日治時期末期，採皇民化政策而壓抑道教。但台灣道教仍蓬勃發展。台灣道教從傳入以來就承襲閩南文化的道教特性，到現代仍保有此特色。除了正一道之外，全真道亦於近年大陸進行改革開放時傳入台灣。

部份佛教徒的看法
漢傳佛教僧人釋星雲認為，雖然現今道教仍然流行，但是它已經淪為以殺牲祭祀、符錄齋醮、臨喪招魂、除妖作法、風水勘輿等江湖術士之事為主要特徵的民間宗教。他聲稱在台灣，宮觀雖多，也能在裏面找到廟公，但很難找到道士，可見其衰落的趨勢，由於道教既難以走出中華而成為世界性宗教，又無法去除其濃厚的迷信色彩，因此在踏入現代之後，道教已經逐漸沒落。

台灣道教道壇
北台灣正一道門
基隆道壇
基隆雷成道壇，在北部地區道壇頗負盛名的基隆「雷成壇」，道法傳承上已有150年歷史，從清朝時期祖先一脈傳承下來，至今已是第五代了，25年前曾獲市府邀請進行祈雨法會，另外，基隆重要節慶中元祭老大公廟開、關龕門儀式，20年來也一直由雷成壇主持，第一代高祖清朝時代在基隆地區廟宇，專司信眾祈福補運、消災解厄等等，基隆早期最盛的中元祭典為碼頭工會主導舉辦，每年都聘他們家擔任主壇道長，雷成壇都是作吉事方面的法事，如建醮、驅煞及祭改等等。父親是第四代李騰龍道長，同樣繼承衣缽承襲道法二門科儀與米卦占卜，1993年因為沒有颱風，基隆罕見出現嚴重缺水荒，當時市長林水木特聘李騰龍道長主持祈雨儀式後， 隨即普降甘霖，紓解水荒。早年，基隆中元祭農曆七月開、關龕門重要儀式，都是由出家比丘主持，1998年地方人士建議改由道士主持，李戊己從那年起就擔任開龕門土主法道長至今。早年基隆地區只有李家道士一脈，李騰龍因是長子對道士工作又有趣，便傳承了祖先道士家業，李騰龍名聲遠播，10多年前，曾有日本、荷蘭及美國教授陸續來台，向他的父親拜師學藝， 雷成壇也曾受邀到中國大陸、新加坡主持寺廟法會，國內地區主持的法會更是不計其數。
基隆廣遠道壇 丹心宗壇簡介
宗壇由李游坤先生（道號玄正）於民國八十六年農曆八月二十三日創立。玄正道長乃基隆廣遠壇李松溪道長之嗣男，自幼秉性純正，深受祖傳道法精髓之薰陶。李道長於台灣聲名卓著，常受邀至中國、馬來西亞等處主持大型齋醮儀式，曾參與國家表演藝術中心國家兩廳院內的劇場演出：《醮》，亦長期擔任台北府城隍廟法務主持，並常與中研院李豐楙院士、輔大宗教系張超然教授等人互相奧援道門知識之教學，可謂台灣的道學泰斗。
玄正道長不僅有藥學背景，更於晚年孜孜不倦地挑戰高等教育獲取碩士學位，以期能時刻與時代並肩前行。也曾拜師深造、精研性命雙修之學，充實正統道教之專業學養。懷抱著弘道的初心，玄正道長孜孜不倦，精進修持，於實際傳道濟世之中，深感傳統道教大道未興，正法未彰，人心陷溺，尤其師道衰微，道紀廢弛，部分道徒未能自省自勵，邪法亂行，致使社會對道士形象多有誤解，此情此景，令玄正道長深感痛心。故玄正道長秉承父志，毅然創立宗壇，揭櫫教化根本，致力於道教教育之實踐，宣揚道德正信，以期興隆道化，濟死度生。
丹心宗壇以道教教育為本務，培育傳度眾多正一派道士，並於民國一百一十一年開立丹心道教學院，全面性教授適用於現代的道法與道家哲學。李道長首重道徒內修，強調人品之培養。以戒為師，確立師道尊嚴，以道教化，傳道為教，並以振興道教為宗旨。目前台灣北部有許多執業道長均曾師從玄正道長學習道法科儀。
祖傳道法法派派詩（正一道教）云：
「守道明仁德，全真復太和，至誠宣玉典，忠正演全科，
沖漢通玄蘊，高洪鼎大羅，三山愈興振，福海湧洪波。」

台北道壇
台北林家「臺灣北部正一派道士譜系」摘要勞格文從劉枝萬關於醮典研究的論文中，引起了探討台灣北部正一派道士譜系的研究動機，從其所掌握的三個部分的資料：一是劉枝萬的幾篇論文；一是道士在法場及醮典中所召請的祖師；另外是勞格文的老師朱堃燦道士所知道的流傳於道士間的掌故。展開田野調查並將調查延伸到大陸，透過分析求證，期使整個道脈之演變傳承能夠明晰呈現。劉枝萬博士在關於松山醮典的論文中，介紹了北部道士兩大派系：劉厝派與林厝派。其兩派譜系由法學者勞格文（John Lagerwey）在本文中探討。劉的諭文中指出：劉厝派來台祖先為劉師法（1644年由福建漳州來台），林厝派開台祖林章貴（號演達，1820年左右由詔安來台），在枋寮村（今之中和）創立威遠壇，傳給金迎，再傳科選，而選傳清江（翀庭），江傳心婦。而後心婦另在台北也設一道壇。而劉厝派的傳說，林厝派初來台時並非道士，而是在劉厝派擔任香辦的職務，因而漸漸熟悉其程，自習科儀才學會了而自行開設道壇。但這傳說是否為實？勞格文在此論文中逐一揭示。
劉林兩派派詩：
劉厝派   興、良、明、應、德、金、真、合、太、和
林厝派   忠、正、演、金、科、翀、漢、通、玄、蘊
林厝派的探討，查訪林昌桐.勞格文從饒平黃崗沿海一帶開始田野調查
大陸夏校（昔稱寨後）坪溪（彭溪）一帶的訪查.劉厝並不是客家人，是潮州人。
20代  林榮練
21代  林欲東（錦真）
22代  林汝 夯，
江道士的資料：祖師 劉古泉、劉守心、劉典清、劉玉玄、張百二、張茂賢、張雅哲、江法耀
天師教傳承地區：官陂、霞葛、秀篆
混元教傳承地區：太平、浮山
台灣北部道士和福建某些地區－如龍巖、山格、金山及廣東饒平等地，都稱其傳承與三奶信仰有關。而客家平和的兩名道士及詔安客家的江姓道士都認為三奶派的儀式並非正派的儀式。結論：現今台灣北部所見的道教科儀很可能是1820年由林厝祖先從南陂（詔安）傳進台灣的。香辦的傳說可是說是林／劉二派合作之初的一個變形的回憶。

新竹道壇
新竹有兩種正一道派，一為道法二門的正一派紅頭道士，二為正一威盟紫光派下系統的正一派黑頭道士

新竹林家
新竹莊家

竹塹正一黑頭道士，為吉事、拔亡事皆辦，與專辦吉事的北部正一紅頭道士不同，正一黑頭道士為泉州當地流傳，其道脈結合了 泉州一帶特殊的正一靈寶拔亡科儀、大上清宮紫光派法等。
泉籍道士在清朝中葉時期來到竹塹落地生根，到了十九世紀末，竹塹內公館林家的林汝梅，懷有求道之心，但看到了竹塹道士很多除了謀生外，缺乏修養，深感遺憾，因此積極培植鄰居 陳捷三，並與堂弟林修梅前往大陸龍虎山，拜六十一代張天師為師，學習道法，學成後歸回家鄉，奉天師之令，創立 萬法宗壇分司正一嗣壇，掌管台地教務，為第二個天師府。在當時交通不便的年代，正一嗣壇擔任著台地的天師府職務，給與道士授職、授籙。
林汝梅當時邀請了眾多道士們集聚在一起，詳細講解經典中教義，講述南北道派的差異，附近從事道士(紅黑頭皆有)職業的人們，也會來向林汝梅請教，林汝梅也會詳細的向道士們解說，甚至當時附近有些紅頭道壇的服飾，也受其影響，與黑頭道士服飾相似。
竹塹正弌嗣壇派下之道壇
通靈壇莊家
林汝梅收鄰居陳捷三為徒，陳捷三育有一女，招道士莊紫為贅婿，生 莊陳登雲，莊陳登雲生 莊肇欣、莊肇嘉 二位，此二人為鼎字輩高功道長，莊肇欣道長已登真。

通妙壇陳家
陳家為內公館林家之親戚，早期有一位道長於新竹都城隍廟周圍，名為陳張石泉，人稱「石泉仙」，生六子，如今通妙壇的 陳張植福(家中排名第五，道士界稱為 老五)與陳永福 二位道長皆為 鼎字輩高功道長。

萬真壇郭家
郭家為百年歷史的道壇，因位於竹塹城南門，亦稱南門萬真壇，現今的鼎字輩高功道長 郭金灶 老道長已無做法事，在家中修身養性，現已高齡近百。

靈真壇何家
何家為百年歷史的道壇，因位於竹塹城北門，亦稱北門靈真壇。第三代壇主為何金鐘老道長(已仙逝)，第四代壇主為何子慶老道長(已仙逝)，何子慶道長生前囑咐，將壇中部分法器、經典捐贈給新竹長和宮文物館，供世人了解竹塹道教文化。
正一道法二門派下之道壇
新竹地區有 振應壇、通應壇、金應壇、顯應壇 等道壇，與北部正一道派相同，皆為專辦吉慶紅事之道壇。

南門地區的百年道壇，現任壇主為 張烱熹 道長。

中台灣正一道門
中部地區的靈寶派以鹿港為核心，逐漸向彰化、臺中靠海地區、及雲林等地拓展。歷史較為悠久的靈寶道壇集中在鹿港，莊意是最早在設壇傳法的道士，但未留有後代嗣法；其次為清嘉慶年間來臺，祖籍安溪楊家的「顯應壇」，是鹿港的老牌壇號，其法傳授鄰近的和美、秀水與雲林褒忠、臺中梧棲等地。現今鹿港較著名為清乾隆末葉來臺發展的施家道壇，迄今已傳至第七代，家族中分別立有「混元壇」、「達真壇、「守真壇」與「保真壇」等。南投竹山與彰化靠山地區，有廈門系的靈寶道派，以拔度齋法為主，科儀形式與鹿港靈寶道派相似。

南投道壇
南投竹山與彰化靠山地區，有廈門系的靈寶道派，以拔度齋法為主，科儀形式與鹿港靈寶道派相似。 

竹山守真道房

台中道壇
台中正一派以曾厝派為主，與北部正一道法二門相同，皆為專辦吉事。廣應壇為曾厝派祖壇，由靈安壇、廣安壇等道壇為代表，其都以台中城隍廟為中心
曾厝派道號字輩為 太和至誠宣玉典

彰化道壇
彰化正一道壇由埤腳鎮興壇為主，與北部正一(林厝派.劉厝派)所用經典相同，其始祖為法致蔡先生於鎮興壇所傳承之太上正一啟請玄科中祖師和北部正一派所傳承祖師亦有雷同，其在北部、中部亦有傳承北部代表為基隆正一朝天府、中部代表為指微道壇

道士
臺灣道教的本土道士主要教務一則度生，一則度死。所謂度死，乃是俗稱做功德的喪葬拔度齋事科儀。度生法事又可分為祈福與驅邪，前者有建醮、謝平安、做三獻等社群法事，而驅邪則指安胎、起土押煞、補運制解等常民法事。道士又因派別或是地域不同而有不同稱呼，通常臺灣話通稱道士為師公，若再依教派或是地域細分，紅頭師公（紅頭道士）只專門度生，烏頭師公（黑頭道士）專門度生與度死。然而，紅黑頭的區分僅在部分地區有此度生、度死之區分，並非絕對。不論紅黑頭，臺灣道士多可追溯其源頭自福建與廣東一帶，多屬正一派傳衍。
雖然臺灣本地道派豐富，各道派各有所長，但其所本之科儀內容皆可源自唐宋甚至魏晉時期的傳統。以往，因祖籍與習俗不同而每個道派有其區域優勢，但是近年因為交通發達以及網路傳播迅速，各教派發展已經不再受地域限制。
臺灣道教近年以教團組織工會，稱為道士職業工會，是從事道教教務的法師與道士所成立，為保障神職人員社勞工福利，並辦理一些職業訓練課程，因職業化也是屬於勞方的一種。
建醮吉事科儀: 發表(或玉壇發表)、啟請祝聖、獻供、演拜經懺、分燈、宿啟、朝科、進表、入醮降帝、施放水燈、普施孤幽、謝壇圓滿等等。基本上臺灣流行醮事科儀從一朝始，至一朝宿啟、二朝、二朝宿啟、三朝、五朝或以上，最多曾做至四十九朝之羅天大醮。建醮還會依目的不同而增列不同科儀，如慶祝廟宇落成之慶成醮、祈求平安之清醮、禳災之水火醮、普度孤魂的普度醮、禳瘟災而有王醮、也有依拜斗法會而成的禮斗醮甚至是慶祝神明聖誕之生日醮，十分多元。
拔度齋事科儀：發表，啟請，引魂，度人經（上中下），普施，赦罪水懺（上中下），藥懺，開城，放赦，沐浴，解願，路關，擔經，過橋，入厝，化庫，謝壇圓滿。此為最基本之拔度齋事，另可增加其他科儀，最多可做至三朝黃籙大齋。

信仰人口
據中華民國內政部提供資料顯示，台澎金馬地區現有包含玉帝廟、媽祖廟、玄帝廟、太子元帥廟、王爺廟等等種類的宮廟共8000間以上，利用民房設立之中型道壇約在10000間左右無數，傳教人員28,000餘人，信眾在8,000,000以上（佔全臺灣人口三分之一以上），但此數字部份與佛教有重疊情况，台灣民眾許多同時信奉佛道二教。

沿革
開教
天主教進入台灣，最早始於西班牙人統治台灣北部，1626年西班牙人登陸台灣北部時設立諸聖教堂，同時有西班牙籍的道明會會士來到台灣對原住民傳教，當中著名者有哈辛托·艾斯奇維（Jacinto Esquivel，1592-1633），他於1631年來臺傳教。是第一位走出西班牙人堡壘到原住民各社傳教的神父。他並利用羅馬拼音來拼寫「淡水語」。編有《淡水語辭彙》，並翻譯《淡水語教理書》，此外還在1632年設立「神學院」（學林），直到1633年他被派往日本傳教。在羅美洛（Alonso Garcia Romero）出任西班牙雞籠淡水長官時期（1634-1635），西班牙在北臺灣的統治達到巔峰，當時從淡水沿基隆河陸路行走到雞籠都還相當安全，傳教士的影響力也比先前所膽敢推想得更遠。據道明會神父奎洛斯寫道，「光我一個人」「在八天之內為淡水河附近三百二十個居民施洗，當時他們正為麻疹所苦，而在三貂於五天內為一百四十一人施洗...」:181
1642年，荷蘭發動雞籠之戰，西班牙被迫離開台灣，天主教在臺灣的傳播也一度中斷。

清治時期
清治咸豐九年（1859年）5月18日，道明會再次來到臺灣傳揚福音，三位來自菲律賓的西班牙籍道明會傳教士郭德剛（Fernando Sainz）及洪保律（Angel Bofurull）等人及五位中國教友傳道員，從中国大陆橫渡台灣海峽抵達打狗港（今高雄港），同年12月在靠近今日高雄愛河河口的地方購地興建簡易傳教所（即今玫瑰聖母聖殿主教座堂址），成為天主教會在台灣的第一個據點。此為天主教正式在台灣之始，至2009年已逾150年。
台灣天主教會開教後，早期隸屬於中國（清朝）的福建代牧區（今福州教區）管理，1883年改歸新成立的廈門代牧區（今廈門教區）管轄，當時主要由道明會總理教務。

日治時期
1895年，清朝與日本簽訂《馬關條約》，台灣改由日本統治，但教務仍隸屬廈門代牧區管轄。1913年（日治大正9年），聖座（教廷）始將台灣（即日屬台灣）脫離廈門代牧區，獨立設置台灣監牧區，教務仍由道明會會士所主持，以高雄為教務中心。第二次世界大戰爆發前，台灣天主教會轉為日籍神職人員負責。在日本統治的這段期間，台灣天主教友的人數從2千人成長至約1萬人，僅有少數州廳還未設有教堂，這為戰後台灣天主教會的擴張建立了基礎。

戰後至今
1945年，台灣進入中華民國時代，台灣的日籍神職人員被全部遣返，台灣天主教會的教務改由華籍神父主導，但監牧再由道明會會士擔任。1949年，中華民國政府播遷台灣之後，由於中國大陸新建立的社會主義政權採無神論治國，有不少本國及外國籍的天主教徒及神職人員離開中國大陸，其中的大部分來到台灣。除了在台灣服務的修會增加外，台灣本地與中國大陸來台的神職人員也逐漸取代外國籍神職人員，成為台灣天主教會發展的主力。1952年8月7日，台灣建立聖統制，正式由原有的傳教區體制轉為教區制；而台灣的教區數目，也由原本的1個監牧區，逐漸增加及改制為7個教區、1個宗座署理區。
天主教會及關聯團體在台灣的社會服務、醫療與文化、教育等方面有一定的貢獻。各大政黨包括國民黨和民進黨等都致力與聖座發展外交關係。民進黨籍總統陳水扁於2005年訪問羅馬，出席教宗若望保祿二世的葬禮，成為首位到訪教廷的現任中華民國總統。國民黨籍總統馬英九於2013年3月出席新教宗方濟各的就任典禮，是首位與現任教宗會面的中華民國總統。此外，由於海峽兩岸特殊的政治及社會情勢，加上中國大陸天主教會遭到政府高度管制而無法與聖座完全共融，使得台灣天主教會肩負聖座與中國大陸間的「橋樑教會」職責。
2016年的中華民國總統選舉，時任中央研究院副院長陳建仁以無黨籍身分和民進黨籍的蔡英文搭檔參選並當選為副總統，成為台灣歷史及中華民國歷史上首位出任國政要職的天主教徒。

現況
台灣天主教會在於1950年代時曾有長足發展。但1970年代以來教友停滯在30萬人左右，未有顯著之增加，而台灣此際正是人口大幅增加的時期，故可說信仰比例不增反減。為此，台灣天主教會進行調查，在《天主教在台灣現況之研究》一文中認為1950年代的發展係因：

有利的政治因素
社會經濟狀況不穩定
中國大陸教徒及神職人員大批來臺
原住民皈依
而1970年代後的停滯則有以下因素：

社會經濟條件的改善使人的宗教需求下降
傳統文化對於西方宗教的抵制
民間信仰復興
信教人口的遷移
1990年代以來，台灣因為少子化嚴重、且神職人員必須獨身，與台灣人的傳宗接代觀念嚴重衝突，以及在台灣神父社會地位不高，導致台灣缺乏本國籍神父，必須從東南亞等地派遣神父來台；而各教區研議允許平信徒擔任神職人員（如終身執事），也顯示出台灣天主教會的牧靈工作必須更加本土化的迫切性。
此外，雖然台灣與中國大陸自1949年起便處於政治分治分立的狀態，但聖座仍承認中華民國為中國代表而將台灣的教省、教區等教會管區劃歸於中國（相關政治問題請參見海峽兩岸關係）。因為如此，台灣主教團的英文名稱「Chinese Regional Bishops' Conference」，直譯即是「中華區主教團」；聖座在台灣的大使館為「聖座駐華大使館」；而台灣天主教會的大專學生組織，則是稱為「中華天主教大專同學會」等。不過在事實上，臺灣的聖統制已隨著兩岸分治而與中國大陸分離。

教區
日治時期
1940年（日治昭和15年），台灣教區（台灣監牧區）有以下的管轄教會（即今稱之堂區）和小教區（小堂）。

戰後至今
目前台灣的天主教會設有1個教省、1個宗座署理區，均按照政治的行政區劃來劃分。教省之下分為7個教區（包含1個總教區做為教省之首府），其中總教區與主教團均座落於台北。7個教區及台灣主教團，均為中華民國內政部立案之宗教財團法人。

歷史
荷治時期和西治時期
天主教進入臺灣，最早始於西班牙人統治臺灣北部，1626年西班牙人登陸臺灣北部時，同時有西班牙籍的道明會會士來到臺灣對台灣人傳教，對象是北部的凱達格蘭族與噶瑪蘭族，至1642年西班牙被迫離開臺灣後中斷。
基督新教在臺灣荷蘭統治時期1627年由歸正宗傳教士干治士（Georgius Candidius）傳入，對象是南部的西拉雅族，當時的傳教工作屬於殖民政策的一部分，傳教士皆隸屬於荷蘭東印度公司，由荷蘭東印度公司支薪，不像現代由教會奉獻支薪，傳教實際政治目的是對原住民進行文化改造，減少台灣人與殖民者的矛盾，以及不同族群間的矛盾，此時期的傳教工作隨著鄭成功在安平建政以及屠殺西拉雅族之後宣告結束；但也有觀點認為當時奉行帝國主義的荷蘭人藉基督之名屠殺台灣漢人與原住民，原住民人口少了近一半、多數躲到深山裡避難。面對鄭成功屠殺原住民的指控則主張是因為原住民襲擊並殺害了鄭成功的部將林圯及其部隊，認為鄭成功是被害者。
此時期的傳教工作有兩個階段，在1636年以前缺乏組織，傳教工作以口述方式實施，具體行為如背誦祈禱文和教義問答，1636年後開辦學校，並且採用了以拉丁字母書寫的新港語為工具實施宗教教育，解決原住民沒有文字的問題，由於語言工具落後，此時並沒有完整的翻譯聖經，僅有少數新港語的福音書。

明鄭時期
鄭成功殖民期間實施禁教政策，信仰基督教的原住民被迫選擇放棄信仰或逃到深山。此時明鄭諮議參軍陳永華為革除荷蘭人所留下的基督信仰，以及實施儒家思想漢化政策，積極興建孔廟、真武廟、關帝廟等漢人寺廟。也利用免除徭役措施誘使原住民接受漢化教育，相對於荷蘭的語言本土化政策，明鄭時期的宗教政策不僅打擊基督教，也嚴重打擊原住民語言。

清朝時期
1683年6月（康熙22年）施琅攻陷臺灣，之後向康熙表達臺灣的重要性爭取經營臺灣，上奏清廷建議奉臺灣民間信仰的媽祖「天妃」賜晉天后，1684年（康熙23年）清廷准奏，此後主流信仰改為祭拜媽祖，透過宗教傳播方式讓臺灣居民轉移認同感接受大清政權。此後又因乾隆、嘉慶的禁教政策，使得東亞很長一段時間沒再出現傳教士。1865年6月16日（同治四年）英國長老會的馬雅各醫生抵臺，1872年3月7日（同治十一年）加拿大長老會的牧師馬偕牧師抵台。此時期的傳教工作初期常受到漢人暴力反抗，不時發生破壞教堂以及殺害教徒的事件，直到樟腦戰爭後傳教士才有相對安全的環境，並且傳教工作逐漸走向政教分離（如公開反對英國當局的鴉片貿易），傳教語言主要使用白話閩南語，信仰核心為加爾文主義，以教育和醫療作為傳教工作的基礎建設，現存的有新樓醫院、馬偕醫院、淡江中學、真理大學等。
清治咸豐九年（1859年）5月18日，三位來自菲律賓的西班牙籍道明會傳教士及五位中國教友傳道員，從中国大陆橫渡台灣海峽抵達打狗港（今高雄港），同年12月在靠近今日高雄愛河河口的地方購地興建簡易傳教所（即今玫瑰聖母聖殿主教座堂），成為天主教會在台灣的第一個據點。

日治時期
此時期的基督教新教延續馬雅各與馬偕的長老會傳教工作，雖然日本政府對基督教抱持警戒態度，但由於長老會對於當局的政策大多配合，如配合皇民化政策實施日語禮拜，因此基督教不像過去因為政權變遷而被消滅。1926年，由中國大陸基督教徒自行創辦的真耶穌教會從福建傳入臺灣，此教派的作風與公共關係頗具有神秘色彩
。1928年8月，日本救世軍軍官山室軍平來台宣教，在台北、台中設立據點，日後陸續設立了八個部隊。第二次世界大戰後日本成為戰敗國，日本人被遣返，也暫時結束了救世軍在台灣的發展。
日治時期，台灣天主教會教務仍隸屬廈門代牧區管轄，1913年（大正9年）羅馬教廷始將台灣與澎湖（即日占台灣）脫離廈門代牧區，獨立設置台灣監牧區，教務仍由道明會神父所主持，教座則設置於高雄。第二次世界大戰爆發前，台灣天主教會轉為日本籍神職人員負責。在日本統治的這段期間，台灣的教會體制逐漸完備。

教育敕語與基督教關係
1890年10月30日，日本頒佈了教育敕語作為思想教育主軸，宣讀完要對天皇簽名行最敬禮。終戰前日本天皇具有神格地位，此舉對基督教而言形同偶像崇拜，也因此發生了內村鑑三不敬事件。1895年日本開始對台殖民統治，教育敕語也在此實施而產生政府與教會間的緊張關係。

無教會主義
無教會主義為日本神學家內村鑑三所提出的思想，以師徒制宣教。起初無教會主義雖然在日本引起軒然大波，不過當時台灣還在清治時代。日治時代之後矢內原忠雄將此思想傳給一些台灣留學生，如葉榮鐘、陳茂源、張漢裕、陳茂棠、郭維租等人，而矢內原忠雄的另一名學生高橋三郎也曾應邀來台講道。

國民黨政府戒嚴時期
國語教派進入與美援工作
1949年10月國共戰爭處於劣勢，中華民國政府撤退臺灣，中共的無神論政策使許多中國大陸的教會撤退到台灣，形成今日教派林立，這些新進教派流入使官話和合本聖經成為主流，打擊早期臺灣基督長老教會的語言本土化政策

。新進教派主要在人口密集處與學校吸收成員，偏遠地區幾乎沒有設立據點，但有時會用一種稱為短宣的形式實施零星的鄉村傳教活動，通常效果不佳。1950年的美援政策讓一些教會從事發麵粉的社會工作，因此被譏為麵粉教，此時盛行將麵粉袋加工成內褲使用，至今仍然可以找到印有中美合作的加工內褲。
1945年台湾光復，台灣回归中華民國統治，日籍神職人員全部遣返，台灣天主教會的教務改由華籍神父主導，但監牧再由道明會會士擔任。1949年，中華民國政府播遷台灣之後，由於中国共產党為無神論，有不少本國及外國籍的天主教徒及神職人員離開中國大陸，其中的大部分來到台灣。除了在台灣服務的修會增加外，台灣本地與大陸華人來台的神職人員也逐漸取代外國籍神職人員，成為台灣天主教會發展的主力。1952年8月7日，台灣建立聖統制，正式由原有的傳教區體制轉為教區制；而台灣的教區數目，也逐漸由原本的1個監牧區，增加至7個教區、1個宗座署理區。

普世教協與護教反共對立
1950年代世界局勢處於冷戰狀態，同時西方發起了普世教會合一運動以及1948年成立了普世教會協會（簡稱普世教協或WCC），由於普世教協的立場接納社會主義國家，並且主張承認「中華人民共和國」，導致意識形態與政府當局衝突。臺灣基督教環境因此分為兩個陣營，名義上是教義之爭，實際上政治意識形態之爭，當時主導相關活動的人物為美國基要派牧師卡爾·麥堅泰與國民黨要員張靜愚，這段期間發生不少愛國主義衍生的衝突：

1951年臺灣基督長老教會加入普世教協。
1962年國民黨要員張靜愚發起基督教護教反共聯合會與普世教協對立，國語教派陸續加入此陣營。
1970年6月17日發生謝緯牧師車禍撞樹事件，但後人對實際死因有所質疑。
1970年7月30日臺灣基督長老教會為了避免與政府當局擴大衝突，高俊明牧師暫時性退出普世教協。
1971年7月25日配合國民黨強行推動的國語運動，臺北市政府警察局查禁羅馬拼音的布農語聖經。
1975年1月警備總部司令部沒收臺灣聖經公會出版的臺語羅馬字聖經2200本。
1975年4月26日信義會靈光堂張力長老的主張在濟南長老教會現址上建一座「中正紀念禮拜堂」。
1984年教育部函請內政部禁止山地教會使用羅馬字傳教，並禁止族語文字的書刊及聖經。
1987年在美國科羅拉多州曼尼托市舉辦第七屆聯會護教反共大會，這是最後一次護教反共的大型活動。
1989年李登輝繼任總統任內否決「中正紀念禮拜堂」提案，護教反共活動就此結束。
1989年以前愛國主義時常凌駕於加爾文主義之上。

對立關係表
歷史回顧態度
國內教授了解臺灣教會歷史的人物有周聯華、曾慶豹、鄭仰恩、賴永祥、查時傑、陳方中、蔡麗貞等人，某些教派對於戒嚴時期教會歷史明顯採取迴避態度或是愛國主義。

現代
宗教退出校園
解嚴後臺灣逐漸走向言論自由的社會，不僅能公開批評時政，宗教思想也開始多元及百家爭鳴，但是也因此造成一些宗教社會事件，如1995年余奕榮的上帝藉中共審判臺灣之說，導致信徒集體移民貝里斯，宋七力的宇宙發光體之說，中台禪寺事件的學生集體出家，以及神秘主義活動等，這些事件造成當時許多家長與民意代表不信任校內宗教團體，要求宗教退出校園。當時基督教的學生組織主要有校園團契、學園團契、長青團契 （页面存档备份，存于互联网档案馆）（長老教會青年團契），受到政策影響這些組織在公立學校不得成立社團，但實際上並沒有因此消滅而是轉為地下化經營（俗稱地下社團）。

大型特會文化
解嚴後隨著護教反共核心人物相繼過世，1950年代的新進教派失去共同努力方向，當時發起的愛國運動和極右派媒體也相繼消失，之後走向各自發展或是另立合作組織。其中一些會眾制教派開始與韓國基督教及新加坡基督教接觸，發展出亞洲基督教的團結組織，逐漸讓趙鏞基、康希等外籍亞洲牧師成為許多臺灣基督徒追捧對象，並且這些教派經常鼓勵教徒參加一種規模大的「特會」，這些特會經常在中大型活動場館舉辦，此外也有印尼華裔的唐崇榮牧師經常來臺舉辦特會，這種大規模聚眾的活動，是解嚴後才出現的基督教文化。但是這種文化在臺灣基督長老教會、衛理公會、臺灣聖公會等新教傳統宗派並不盛行。

語言復育政策
1982年紐西蘭為了復育毛利語政策成立了第一所語言巢幼兒園，對毛利語復育產生良好效果，2001年臺北市原住民族事務委員會孔文吉前往澳洲、紐西蘭、斐濟等地考察，取得語言巢相關經驗在臺北市實施，一些教會成為語言巢的設立地點，例如：東吳大學安素堂（排灣族）、中山教會（阿美族）、神愛教會（泰雅族、太魯閣族）、玉成教會（阿美族）、佳音教會（排灣族）。在此之前也有臺灣聖經公會翻譯羅馬字拼音的族語聖經，持續語言本土化的傳教政策，例如：鄒語、達悟語（雅美語）、魯凱語、排灣語、布農語、太魯閣語、泰雅爾語、阿美語。

婚姻平權
在家庭議題上，隨著同性婚姻的社會討論，因保守教派認定聖經教導必需支持一夫一妻制，反對修改民法。2013年與其他宗教合力組織護家盟捍衛一夫一妻制。2015年再成立政黨信心希望聯盟，希望透過政治力量重新喚起家庭意識，在2016年中華民國立法委員選舉中，有提名6名不分區立委及10名分區立委，均未當選。雖然大多數教會反對同性婚姻合法化，但也有少數教會支持，如同光教會、真光福音教會、活躍教會、台灣基督長老教會古亭教會等。

臺灣基督宗教宗派
天主教
就天主教而言，真正經營是起始於19世紀中期。1858年，於對外戰爭失利的清廷與西方列強簽訂天津條約，台灣成為可自由經商傳教的地區之一。翌年，西班牙道明會依照羅馬教廷的要求，從菲律賓派神父2人抵台傳教，並在福建教友幫助下，首先於1862年，在打狗（今高雄）建立第一座教堂，是為聖母堂，之後再於1928年改建為今日的玫瑰聖母聖殿主教座堂。
日治時代，天主教會逐漸擴展至全台灣，到1913年7月19日，羅馬教廷成立台灣監牧區，使台灣擁有獨立的教會管區，當時教徒達到萬人，但仍由教廷敕封道明會士作為地方教長。1941年太平洋戰爭爆發後，台灣總督府迫使西方傳教士離台，改由日本人主持教務。二戰後，台灣進入中華民國時期，恢復由西班牙籍道明會神父主持教務。1952年8月7日，羅馬教廷正式在台灣設置教區，而本國籍神父也逐漸接手教務。
今日台灣的天主教會，共分成七個教區、一個宗座署理區、主教十七位，其中包括單國璽樞機的這些主教，均由教宗所敕封。另外，台灣天主教會轄下還有神父修女共兩千位，分別在八百個教堂及社會事業，包括大學（輔大、靜宜、文藻）、醫院、地方診所、安老院、啟智中心等處所服務。台灣天主教信徒雖僅佔台灣人口約百分之一餘（根據2010年天主教官方報告有聖堂718間，教友239,565人，無崇拜人數），但其社會服務事業卻極為有名。

基督新教
台灣基督新教中最大的宗派是加爾文主義的台灣基督長老教會。第二大宗派則是召會。第三大、第四大宗派則是屬福音派、靈恩派，具中國自立教會背景的台北靈糧堂與真耶穌教會。其他擁有較多教友的教會包括浸信會、信義宗背景的信義會、行道會，阿民念主義的基督教台灣聖教會（阿民念主義）、循道宗背景的中華循理會等等。在世界範圍屬主要基督新教宗派的聖公會在台灣相對小眾，台灣聖公會教友僅有數千人，但仍有一定社會影響力。

台灣基督長老教會（歸正宗）
在基督新教方面，馬雅各醫師可以說是是台灣基督教的啟蒙者，他在1865年於台南開始台灣新教的宣揚。再者喬治·萊斯里·馬偕（George Leslie Mackay，1844年3月21日—1901年6月2日）於1871年到達台灣，在滬尾（今新北市淡水區）開始傳教，學習闽南語。並且四處旅行傳播福音，除了在淡水、艋舺（今萬華）、錫口（今松山）、大稻埕、五股、苗栗、臺北、基隆、新竹擁有二十個以上教會之外也藉由行醫擴展基督教的教義，也因此，他所屬的加拿大或蘇格蘭系的長老教會於臺灣為基督教最大組織。據基督教學者調查，2011年台灣基督長老教會有1211個堂會，會友人數240,400人，出席人數86,737人（不含12歲以下兒童）。

中華循理會
循理會早自1895年即委請內地會差派宣教士來華宣教。而至1904年，北美的循理會總會正式差派宣教士安培生及蘇克福牧師到上海宣教。1905年5 月，繼之而來了李、顧、梅等三位宣教士。在同心禱告和上帝的帶領下，從河南鄭州開始佈道，接著以開封為中心，積極向鄰近的榮澤、杞縣、陳留等縣區開拓宣教區。後鑑於培植本地工人的重要性。於1910年又在河南開封創辦開封聖經書院，培育聖工人才。與此同時，健全的行政體系也跟著被建立。1929年在河南開封舉行了第一屆年議會大會，並陸續選出各地區的區會長。
1940年，有一對年輕的宣教士夫婦開始漸膺重任，他們的中文名字為戴永冕、戴永和，是戴德生牧師的孫子、孫媳。他們與中國同工馬可、霍冠英、何恩證等人，轉向陝西開拓新工場，並於1941年在陝西開辦了西北聖經書院，就近訓練事奉的人才。
1944年，由馬可牧師組織了邊疆佈道團，開始踏出向邊區傳道的事工。這一佈道團影響深遠，也反映了循理會的美好特質—隨走隨傳，積極宣教。
1948年，中西同工各15人開始向四川重慶宣教，並積極建立教會。同時也創設了聖經書院、聖光中學及診所的事工。循理會在向華人宣教的歷史中，一直是踏著穩健的步伐向前邁進著。
1949年10月中共建政，因應情勢變化，循理會經由香港輾轉來台灣拓展新局。1952年，司崇德宣教士來台開始聖工。而來寧德教士、聞羔義師母、戴永冕牧師師母、汪養吾牧師師母、石省三弟兄夫婦相繼而來，聖工大大開展。在高雄市河南二路一、二號（原名和平巷一號）成立在台之基督教中華循理會。前三年在高屏地區成立大寮、鳳山、高雄、屏東、田道等教會。1954年，由戴永冕牧師（即內地會戴德生牧師的孫子）、汪養吾牧師、石省三弟兄等召開第一屆台灣年議會。1955年在上址創辦聖光聖經學院，於1968年改為聖光神學院。開始由戴永冕牧師以中華循理會會長兼任院長。他於1964年退休返美，院長由他兒子戴紹曾繼任，至1970年他在台北另創中華福音神學院。
循理會各教會的分佈，大部分都集中在台南以南的高屏地區，台中以北的教會數僅佔總數的5 分之1 。主日講台所使用的語言，除兩原住民區外，絕大多數以國語為主。

其他新教教派
1949年中華民國政府轉進臺灣，“中華人民共和國”的無神論政策使許多新教宗派教會（包括浸信會、衛理公會、聖公會、路德宗和基督復臨安息日會）撤退到台灣，形成今日新教教派林立，這些新進教派流入使官話和合本聖經成為主流，打擊早期臺灣基督長老教會的語言本土化政策。
浸信會於1948年12月26日，在台舉行第一次主日聚會。根據2011年教勢報告，該會在全台建立215所堂會，會友人數44,528人，出席人數19,897人（不含12歲以下兒童）。另外，近年發展最快速的基督新教組織是台北靈糧堂，該堂於2005年紀念建堂50年。據基督教學者調查，該教會在有組織有計劃發展下，2011年全台已植堂119個堂會，會友人數60,034人，出席人數23,695人（不含12歲以下兒童），宗派發展規模幾與浸信會並駕齊驅。
臺灣聖公會，是美國聖公會於1954年建立的美國聖公會海外教區，屬於美國聖公會第八教省。臺灣聖公會在行政體系上雖屬美國聖公會所轄，但實為自立自養教區，設有聖約翰科技大學。
台灣信義會於1954年11月10日正式成立。起源於西元1920年在河南雞公山成立的「基督教中華信義會」，在台灣延續其名，稱為「台灣信義會」。 台灣信義會先從高雄、台北兩地開始，逐漸擴展至台中、嘉義、台南等各地。台灣信義會第一間會堂——「基督教台灣信義會高雄教會」，於1951年成立。初期由美國、挪威、芬蘭和丹麥四國八個差會合作，後來其中四差會因政策不同各自獨立發展成立總會。至1954年信義會所屬之堂會已有十三間、聖經學院一所、文字中心一間以及一處廣播中心，因此有必要建立一個在地的總會管理教會事務並邁向自立的目標。
臺灣衛理會主要是在1949年國民黨撤退來台後由原在中國的衛理公會傳入，1953年在台北正式建立台北衛理堂，1963年招開首屆臨時年議會，建立南北兩教區。1972年台灣教會自立，定名中華基督教衛理公會。
基督復臨安息日會在1951年成立了台灣基督復臨安息日神學院，1955年成立臺安醫院。
基督教宣道會於1963年到達臺灣，表示其會員人數為2300人。
門諾會於1948年出現於台灣原住民的醫療救援項目中。

正教會
台灣基督正教會，於2003年向政府正式註冊，現由正教會普世宗主教聖統香港及東南亞都主教教區管理教務。

東方正統教會
東方正統教會（非指正教會）的成員科普特正教會，初期為服事在台工作或就學的信徒，及嘗試在地宣教，曾借用南港聖玫瑰天主堂和濟南教會的場地舉行禮儀，現已於臺北市木柵建堂。

基督系新興宗教
在台湾亦有一些较少与其他教派来往的小型教派。例如以高雄錫安山為基地的新约教会。在街頭及校園可常見到騎單車穿白襯衫的耶穌基督後期聖徒教會傳教士。耶和華見證人、統一教會也在台灣流傳，但現有人口仍較少。以上在主流基督教而言都是异端。

歷史
日治時期
1895年，大清帝國將台灣省割讓日本後就有部分日本的俄羅斯正教會信徒來台。1901年，管理日本教務的俄羅斯正教會總主教日本的聖尼古拉（俄语：Николай Японский）在台北建立了基督救主堂，並派遣首位堂區神父西蒙（Симеон Юкава）。隨著尼古拉總主教於1912年辭世，繼任的都主教謝爾蓋（Георгий Алексеевич Тихомиров）主要忙於日本本地教務，對台北的教會未有太多關注。但台北的堂區仍然維持運作，直到戰爭開始，教務運作始陷於困難。儘管如此，終戰隔年台北的正教堂區仍有177人。但隨著日本政府最終放棄台灣主權，日本正教會在台灣的活動也趨於終止。另外值得一提的是後來擔任俄羅斯正教會拉緬斯科耶總主教的尼可拉司總主教（日裔，和名佐山ぺトル大麓）就是在1914年生於台北的日本正教會家庭。

戰後至2000年
第二次世界大戰結束後，少數俄羅斯人以及正教信徒隨著國民政府撤遷來台。由於此時台灣並無固定的堂區，神父均為受邀來訪。且隨著在台俄羅斯人相繼離開，1960年後台灣的正教活動漸次沉寂，僅有零星信徒在家祈禱。

2000年以後
2001年，來自希臘阿索斯聖山聖額我略修院的修士司祭李亮（Fr. Jonah Mourtos）再次在台灣建立正教會，並於2003年登記為法人團體。台灣基督東正教會目前歸屬於君士坦丁堡牧首座於1997年在香港成立的香港及東南亞都主教區（香港聖路加主教座堂），並受都主教黎大略（Nektarios Tsilis）的統管及牧養；教會的位置目前位於新北市新店區溪園路389之12號4樓。
2012年，俄裔加拿大籍愛西里爾（Fr. Kirill Shkarbul, 中文名後更改為艾西里爾）來台就讀，學習中文。後於加拿大艾德蒙頓的俄羅斯正教會主教座堂受祝聖為神父，並在2012年底恢復並承襲了1901年日本正教會在台灣的堂區。教會的位置目前位於台北市中正區廈門街49號。

歷史
荷治時期和西治時期
天主教進入臺灣，最早始於西班牙人統治臺灣北部，1626年西班牙人登陸臺灣北部時，同時有西班牙籍的道明會會士來到臺灣對台灣人傳教，對象是北部的凱達格蘭族與噶瑪蘭族，至1642年西班牙被迫離開臺灣後中斷。
基督新教在臺灣荷蘭統治時期1627年由歸正宗傳教士干治士（Georgius Candidius）傳入，對象是南部的西拉雅族，當時的傳教工作屬於殖民政策的一部分，傳教士皆隸屬於荷蘭東印度公司，由荷蘭東印度公司支薪，不像現代由教會奉獻支薪，傳教實際政治目的是對原住民進行文化改造，減少台灣人與殖民者的矛盾，以及不同族群間的矛盾，此時期的傳教工作隨著鄭成功在安平建政以及屠殺西拉雅族之後宣告結束；但也有觀點認為當時奉行帝國主義的荷蘭人藉基督之名屠殺台灣漢人與原住民，原住民人口少了近一半、多數躲到深山裡避難。面對鄭成功屠殺原住民的指控則主張是因為原住民襲擊並殺害了鄭成功的部將林圯及其部隊，認為鄭成功是被害者。
此時期的傳教工作有兩個階段，在1636年以前缺乏組織，傳教工作以口述方式實施，具體行為如背誦祈禱文和教義問答，1636年後開辦學校，並且採用了以拉丁字母書寫的新港語為工具實施宗教教育，解決原住民沒有文字的問題，由於語言工具落後，此時並沒有完整的翻譯聖經，僅有少數新港語的福音書。

明鄭時期
鄭成功殖民期間實施禁教政策，信仰基督教的原住民被迫選擇放棄信仰或逃到深山。此時明鄭諮議參軍陳永華為革除荷蘭人所留下的基督信仰，以及實施儒家思想漢化政策，積極興建孔廟、真武廟、關帝廟等漢人寺廟。也利用免除徭役措施誘使原住民接受漢化教育，相對於荷蘭的語言本土化政策，明鄭時期的宗教政策不僅打擊基督教，也嚴重打擊原住民語言。

清朝時期
1683年6月（康熙22年）施琅攻陷臺灣，之後向康熙表達臺灣的重要性爭取經營臺灣，上奏清廷建議奉臺灣民間信仰的媽祖「天妃」賜晉天后，1684年（康熙23年）清廷准奏，此後主流信仰改為祭拜媽祖，透過宗教傳播方式讓臺灣居民轉移認同感接受大清政權。此後又因乾隆、嘉慶的禁教政策，使得東亞很長一段時間沒再出現傳教士。1865年6月16日（同治四年）英國長老會的馬雅各醫生抵臺，1872年3月7日（同治十一年）加拿大長老會的牧師馬偕牧師抵台。此時期的傳教工作初期常受到漢人暴力反抗，不時發生破壞教堂以及殺害教徒的事件，直到樟腦戰爭後傳教士才有相對安全的環境，並且傳教工作逐漸走向政教分離（如公開反對英國當局的鴉片貿易），傳教語言主要使用白話閩南語，信仰核心為加爾文主義，以教育和醫療作為傳教工作的基礎建設，現存的有新樓醫院、馬偕醫院、淡江中學、真理大學等。
清治咸豐九年（1859年）5月18日，三位來自菲律賓的西班牙籍道明會傳教士及五位中國教友傳道員，從中国大陆橫渡台灣海峽抵達打狗港（今高雄港），同年12月在靠近今日高雄愛河河口的地方購地興建簡易傳教所（即今玫瑰聖母聖殿主教座堂），成為天主教會在台灣的第一個據點。

日治時期
此時期的基督教新教延續馬雅各與馬偕的長老會傳教工作，雖然日本政府對基督教抱持警戒態度，但由於長老會對於當局的政策大多配合，如配合皇民化政策實施日語禮拜，因此基督教不像過去因為政權變遷而被消滅。1926年，由中國大陸基督教徒自行創辦的真耶穌教會從福建傳入臺灣，此教派的作風與公共關係頗具有神秘色彩
。1928年8月，日本救世軍軍官山室軍平來台宣教，在台北、台中設立據點，日後陸續設立了八個部隊。第二次世界大戰後日本成為戰敗國，日本人被遣返，也暫時結束了救世軍在台灣的發展。
日治時期，台灣天主教會教務仍隸屬廈門代牧區管轄，1913年（大正9年）羅馬教廷始將台灣與澎湖（即日占台灣）脫離廈門代牧區，獨立設置台灣監牧區，教務仍由道明會神父所主持，教座則設置於高雄。第二次世界大戰爆發前，台灣天主教會轉為日本籍神職人員負責。在日本統治的這段期間，台灣的教會體制逐漸完備。

教育敕語與基督教關係
1890年10月30日，日本頒佈了教育敕語作為思想教育主軸，宣讀完要對天皇簽名行最敬禮。終戰前日本天皇具有神格地位，此舉對基督教而言形同偶像崇拜，也因此發生了內村鑑三不敬事件。1895年日本開始對台殖民統治，教育敕語也在此實施而產生政府與教會間的緊張關係。

無教會主義
無教會主義為日本神學家內村鑑三所提出的思想，以師徒制宣教。起初無教會主義雖然在日本引起軒然大波，不過當時台灣還在清治時代。日治時代之後矢內原忠雄將此思想傳給一些台灣留學生，如葉榮鐘、陳茂源、張漢裕、陳茂棠、郭維租等人，而矢內原忠雄的另一名學生高橋三郎也曾應邀來台講道。

國民黨政府戒嚴時期
國語教派進入與美援工作
1949年10月國共戰爭處於劣勢，中華民國政府撤退臺灣，中共的無神論政策使許多中國大陸的教會撤退到台灣，形成今日教派林立，這些新進教派流入使官話和合本聖經成為主流，打擊早期臺灣基督長老教會的語言本土化政策

。新進教派主要在人口密集處與學校吸收成員，偏遠地區幾乎沒有設立據點，但有時會用一種稱為短宣的形式實施零星的鄉村傳教活動，通常效果不佳。1950年的美援政策讓一些教會從事發麵粉的社會工作，因此被譏為麵粉教，此時盛行將麵粉袋加工成內褲使用，至今仍然可以找到印有中美合作的加工內褲。
1945年台湾光復，台灣回归中華民國統治，日籍神職人員全部遣返，台灣天主教會的教務改由華籍神父主導，但監牧再由道明會會士擔任。1949年，中華民國政府播遷台灣之後，由於中国共產党為無神論，有不少本國及外國籍的天主教徒及神職人員離開中國大陸，其中的大部分來到台灣。除了在台灣服務的修會增加外，台灣本地與大陸華人來台的神職人員也逐漸取代外國籍神職人員，成為台灣天主教會發展的主力。1952年8月7日，台灣建立聖統制，正式由原有的傳教區體制轉為教區制；而台灣的教區數目，也逐漸由原本的1個監牧區，增加至7個教區、1個宗座署理區。

普世教協與護教反共對立
1950年代世界局勢處於冷戰狀態，同時西方發起了普世教會合一運動以及1948年成立了普世教會協會（簡稱普世教協或WCC），由於普世教協的立場接納社會主義國家，並且主張承認「中華人民共和國」，導致意識形態與政府當局衝突。臺灣基督教環境因此分為兩個陣營，名義上是教義之爭，實際上政治意識形態之爭，當時主導相關活動的人物為美國基要派牧師卡爾·麥堅泰與國民黨要員張靜愚，這段期間發生不少愛國主義衍生的衝突：

1951年臺灣基督長老教會加入普世教協。
1962年國民黨要員張靜愚發起基督教護教反共聯合會與普世教協對立，國語教派陸續加入此陣營。
1970年6月17日發生謝緯牧師車禍撞樹事件，但後人對實際死因有所質疑。
1970年7月30日臺灣基督長老教會為了避免與政府當局擴大衝突，高俊明牧師暫時性退出普世教協。
1971年7月25日配合國民黨強行推動的國語運動，臺北市政府警察局查禁羅馬拼音的布農語聖經。
1975年1月警備總部司令部沒收臺灣聖經公會出版的臺語羅馬字聖經2200本。
1975年4月26日信義會靈光堂張力長老的主張在濟南長老教會現址上建一座「中正紀念禮拜堂」。
1984年教育部函請內政部禁止山地教會使用羅馬字傳教，並禁止族語文字的書刊及聖經。
1987年在美國科羅拉多州曼尼托市舉辦第七屆聯會護教反共大會，這是最後一次護教反共的大型活動。
1989年李登輝繼任總統任內否決「中正紀念禮拜堂」提案，護教反共活動就此結束。
1989年以前愛國主義時常凌駕於加爾文主義之上。

對立關係表
歷史回顧態度
國內教授了解臺灣教會歷史的人物有周聯華、曾慶豹、鄭仰恩、賴永祥、查時傑、陳方中、蔡麗貞等人，某些教派對於戒嚴時期教會歷史明顯採取迴避態度或是愛國主義。

現代
宗教退出校園
解嚴後臺灣逐漸走向言論自由的社會，不僅能公開批評時政，宗教思想也開始多元及百家爭鳴，但是也因此造成一些宗教社會事件，如1995年余奕榮的上帝藉中共審判臺灣之說，導致信徒集體移民貝里斯，宋七力的宇宙發光體之說，中台禪寺事件的學生集體出家，以及神秘主義活動等，這些事件造成當時許多家長與民意代表不信任校內宗教團體，要求宗教退出校園。當時基督教的學生組織主要有校園團契、學園團契、長青團契 （页面存档备份，存于互联网档案馆）（長老教會青年團契），受到政策影響這些組織在公立學校不得成立社團，但實際上並沒有因此消滅而是轉為地下化經營（俗稱地下社團）。

大型特會文化
解嚴後隨著護教反共核心人物相繼過世，1950年代的新進教派失去共同努力方向，當時發起的愛國運動和極右派媒體也相繼消失，之後走向各自發展或是另立合作組織。其中一些會眾制教派開始與韓國基督教及新加坡基督教接觸，發展出亞洲基督教的團結組織，逐漸讓趙鏞基、康希等外籍亞洲牧師成為許多臺灣基督徒追捧對象，並且這些教派經常鼓勵教徒參加一種規模大的「特會」，這些特會經常在中大型活動場館舉辦，此外也有印尼華裔的唐崇榮牧師經常來臺舉辦特會，這種大規模聚眾的活動，是解嚴後才出現的基督教文化。但是這種文化在臺灣基督長老教會、衛理公會、臺灣聖公會等新教傳統宗派並不盛行。

語言復育政策
1982年紐西蘭為了復育毛利語政策成立了第一所語言巢幼兒園，對毛利語復育產生良好效果，2001年臺北市原住民族事務委員會孔文吉前往澳洲、紐西蘭、斐濟等地考察，取得語言巢相關經驗在臺北市實施，一些教會成為語言巢的設立地點，例如：東吳大學安素堂（排灣族）、中山教會（阿美族）、神愛教會（泰雅族、太魯閣族）、玉成教會（阿美族）、佳音教會（排灣族）。在此之前也有臺灣聖經公會翻譯羅馬字拼音的族語聖經，持續語言本土化的傳教政策，例如：鄒語、達悟語（雅美語）、魯凱語、排灣語、布農語、太魯閣語、泰雅爾語、阿美語。

婚姻平權
在家庭議題上，隨著同性婚姻的社會討論，因保守教派認定聖經教導必需支持一夫一妻制，反對修改民法。2013年與其他宗教合力組織護家盟捍衛一夫一妻制。2015年再成立政黨信心希望聯盟，希望透過政治力量重新喚起家庭意識，在2016年中華民國立法委員選舉中，有提名6名不分區立委及10名分區立委，均未當選。雖然大多數教會反對同性婚姻合法化，但也有少數教會支持，如同光教會、真光福音教會、活躍教會、台灣基督長老教會古亭教會等。

臺灣基督宗教宗派
天主教
就天主教而言，真正經營是起始於19世紀中期。1858年，於對外戰爭失利的清廷與西方列強簽訂天津條約，台灣成為可自由經商傳教的地區之一。翌年，西班牙道明會依照羅馬教廷的要求，從菲律賓派神父2人抵台傳教，並在福建教友幫助下，首先於1862年，在打狗（今高雄）建立第一座教堂，是為聖母堂，之後再於1928年改建為今日的玫瑰聖母聖殿主教座堂。
日治時代，天主教會逐漸擴展至全台灣，到1913年7月19日，羅馬教廷成立台灣監牧區，使台灣擁有獨立的教會管區，當時教徒達到萬人，但仍由教廷敕封道明會士作為地方教長。1941年太平洋戰爭爆發後，台灣總督府迫使西方傳教士離台，改由日本人主持教務。二戰後，台灣進入中華民國時期，恢復由西班牙籍道明會神父主持教務。1952年8月7日，羅馬教廷正式在台灣設置教區，而本國籍神父也逐漸接手教務。
今日台灣的天主教會，共分成七個教區、一個宗座署理區、主教十七位，其中包括單國璽樞機的這些主教，均由教宗所敕封。另外，台灣天主教會轄下還有神父修女共兩千位，分別在八百個教堂及社會事業，包括大學（輔大、靜宜、文藻）、醫院、地方診所、安老院、啟智中心等處所服務。台灣天主教信徒雖僅佔台灣人口約百分之一餘（根據2010年天主教官方報告有聖堂718間，教友239,565人，無崇拜人數），但其社會服務事業卻極為有名。

基督新教
台灣基督新教中最大的宗派是加爾文主義的台灣基督長老教會。第二大宗派則是召會。第三大、第四大宗派則是屬福音派、靈恩派，具中國自立教會背景的台北靈糧堂與真耶穌教會。其他擁有較多教友的教會包括浸信會、信義宗背景的信義會、行道會，阿民念主義的基督教台灣聖教會（阿民念主義）、循道宗背景的中華循理會等等。在世界範圍屬主要基督新教宗派的聖公會在台灣相對小眾，台灣聖公會教友僅有數千人，但仍有一定社會影響力。

台灣基督長老教會（歸正宗）
在基督新教方面，馬雅各醫師可以說是是台灣基督教的啟蒙者，他在1865年於台南開始台灣新教的宣揚。再者喬治·萊斯里·馬偕（George Leslie Mackay，1844年3月21日—1901年6月2日）於1871年到達台灣，在滬尾（今新北市淡水區）開始傳教，學習闽南語。並且四處旅行傳播福音，除了在淡水、艋舺（今萬華）、錫口（今松山）、大稻埕、五股、苗栗、臺北、基隆、新竹擁有二十個以上教會之外也藉由行醫擴展基督教的教義，也因此，他所屬的加拿大或蘇格蘭系的長老教會於臺灣為基督教最大組織。據基督教學者調查，2011年台灣基督長老教會有1211個堂會，會友人數240,400人，出席人數86,737人（不含12歲以下兒童）。

中華循理會
循理會早自1895年即委請內地會差派宣教士來華宣教。而至1904年，北美的循理會總會正式差派宣教士安培生及蘇克福牧師到上海宣教。1905年5 月，繼之而來了李、顧、梅等三位宣教士。在同心禱告和上帝的帶領下，從河南鄭州開始佈道，接著以開封為中心，積極向鄰近的榮澤、杞縣、陳留等縣區開拓宣教區。後鑑於培植本地工人的重要性。於1910年又在河南開封創辦開封聖經書院，培育聖工人才。與此同時，健全的行政體系也跟著被建立。1929年在河南開封舉行了第一屆年議會大會，並陸續選出各地區的區會長。
1940年，有一對年輕的宣教士夫婦開始漸膺重任，他們的中文名字為戴永冕、戴永和，是戴德生牧師的孫子、孫媳。他們與中國同工馬可、霍冠英、何恩證等人，轉向陝西開拓新工場，並於1941年在陝西開辦了西北聖經書院，就近訓練事奉的人才。
1944年，由馬可牧師組織了邊疆佈道團，開始踏出向邊區傳道的事工。這一佈道團影響深遠，也反映了循理會的美好特質—隨走隨傳，積極宣教。
1948年，中西同工各15人開始向四川重慶宣教，並積極建立教會。同時也創設了聖經書院、聖光中學及診所的事工。循理會在向華人宣教的歷史中，一直是踏著穩健的步伐向前邁進著。
1949年10月中共建政，因應情勢變化，循理會經由香港輾轉來台灣拓展新局。1952年，司崇德宣教士來台開始聖工。而來寧德教士、聞羔義師母、戴永冕牧師師母、汪養吾牧師師母、石省三弟兄夫婦相繼而來，聖工大大開展。在高雄市河南二路一、二號（原名和平巷一號）成立在台之基督教中華循理會。前三年在高屏地區成立大寮、鳳山、高雄、屏東、田道等教會。1954年，由戴永冕牧師（即內地會戴德生牧師的孫子）、汪養吾牧師、石省三弟兄等召開第一屆台灣年議會。1955年在上址創辦聖光聖經學院，於1968年改為聖光神學院。開始由戴永冕牧師以中華循理會會長兼任院長。他於1964年退休返美，院長由他兒子戴紹曾繼任，至1970年他在台北另創中華福音神學院。
循理會各教會的分佈，大部分都集中在台南以南的高屏地區，台中以北的教會數僅佔總數的5 分之1 。主日講台所使用的語言，除兩原住民區外，絕大多數以國語為主。

其他新教教派
1949年中華民國政府轉進臺灣，“中華人民共和國”的無神論政策使許多新教宗派教會（包括浸信會、衛理公會、聖公會、路德宗和基督復臨安息日會）撤退到台灣，形成今日新教教派林立，這些新進教派流入使官話和合本聖經成為主流，打擊早期臺灣基督長老教會的語言本土化政策。
浸信會於1948年12月26日，在台舉行第一次主日聚會。根據2011年教勢報告，該會在全台建立215所堂會，會友人數44,528人，出席人數19,897人（不含12歲以下兒童）。另外，近年發展最快速的基督新教組織是台北靈糧堂，該堂於2005年紀念建堂50年。據基督教學者調查，該教會在有組織有計劃發展下，2011年全台已植堂119個堂會，會友人數60,034人，出席人數23,695人（不含12歲以下兒童），宗派發展規模幾與浸信會並駕齊驅。
臺灣聖公會，是美國聖公會於1954年建立的美國聖公會海外教區，屬於美國聖公會第八教省。臺灣聖公會在行政體系上雖屬美國聖公會所轄，但實為自立自養教區，設有聖約翰科技大學。
台灣信義會於1954年11月10日正式成立。起源於西元1920年在河南雞公山成立的「基督教中華信義會」，在台灣延續其名，稱為「台灣信義會」。 台灣信義會先從高雄、台北兩地開始，逐漸擴展至台中、嘉義、台南等各地。台灣信義會第一間會堂——「基督教台灣信義會高雄教會」，於1951年成立。初期由美國、挪威、芬蘭和丹麥四國八個差會合作，後來其中四差會因政策不同各自獨立發展成立總會。至1954年信義會所屬之堂會已有十三間、聖經學院一所、文字中心一間以及一處廣播中心，因此有必要建立一個在地的總會管理教會事務並邁向自立的目標。
臺灣衛理會主要是在1949年國民黨撤退來台後由原在中國的衛理公會傳入，1953年在台北正式建立台北衛理堂，1963年招開首屆臨時年議會，建立南北兩教區。1972年台灣教會自立，定名中華基督教衛理公會。
基督復臨安息日會在1951年成立了台灣基督復臨安息日神學院，1955年成立臺安醫院。
基督教宣道會於1963年到達臺灣，表示其會員人數為2300人。
門諾會於1948年出現於台灣原住民的醫療救援項目中。

正教會
台灣基督正教會，於2003年向政府正式註冊，現由正教會普世宗主教聖統香港及東南亞都主教教區管理教務。

東方正統教會
東方正統教會（非指正教會）的成員科普特正教會，初期為服事在台工作或就學的信徒，及嘗試在地宣教，曾借用南港聖玫瑰天主堂和濟南教會的場地舉行禮儀，現已於臺北市木柵建堂。

基督系新興宗教
在台湾亦有一些较少与其他教派来往的小型教派。例如以高雄錫安山為基地的新约教会。在街頭及校園可常見到騎單車穿白襯衫的耶穌基督後期聖徒教會傳教士。耶和華見證人、統一教會也在台灣流傳，但現有人口仍較少。以上在主流基督教而言都是异端。

信仰發展
在略廣義的臺灣地區（臺、澎），最早的媽祖廟為澎湖天后宮，至於臺灣島最早的媽祖廟則欠缺明確的文獻記載。學者石萬壽認為臺灣本島的媽祖廟早於明鄭時期興建者僅有魍港天妃宮，為鄭芝龍招募來臺墾殖者所興建，大約建於明崇禎年間:20。不過當時荷蘭人統治下的臺南地區也有漢人聚落，應也自中國大陸帶來了媽祖信仰，但或許尚未正式建廟，僅以草寮供奉或是於住宅中供奉:20。

明鄭時期
顏思齊、鄭芝龍攻臺，有些人便到大龜肉（鹽水舊稱）居住。明天啟三年（1623年）鹽水糖郊「崇興行」自湄洲迎來一尊媽祖（糖郊媽），合祀於福德祠，為現鹽水護庇宮。
臺灣有不少媽祖廟將其源流追溯到鄭成功與其軍隊，例如安平開臺天后宮、本協朝天宮（臺南後壁）、下橋頭朝安宮（臺南後壁）等廟:47、48，不過有學者如盧嘉興則認為鄭軍信奉的是玄天上帝，明鄭時期並未建媽祖廟。清朝為了鞏固政權，宣揚媽祖幫助清兵的神蹟，展現清朝統治為順應天意。但也有學者如石萬壽則認為鄭軍子弟多來自媽祖信仰廣布的東南沿海，鄭軍不可能無奉祀媽祖:21。而學者張耘書則認為即使玄天上帝與媽祖皆具有海神性質，但玄天上帝同時也有國家（明朝）守護神的地位，故明鄭時期官方較為重視玄天上帝:21。而就近年來的研究，有學者認為臺南大天后宮早在施琅入臺之前便已變成，是為「東寧天妃廟」

清朝時期
由於萬正色、施琅等將領利用媽祖信仰助長軍威，並將平臺滅鄭之功績歸於媽祖顯靈，奏請將媽祖冊封為天后，而後清朝政府來臺處理民變時也多藉助媽祖神明之名來鎮壓民眾，在清朝官方刻意推廣下，媽祖信仰完全取代明鄭時期玄天上帝(北極星)信仰而在臺灣得以蓬勃發展:21、22。而約在嘉慶年間，媽祖信仰的主力逐漸從朝廷、官軍轉為民間，例如臺灣府城的重要媽祖廟（大天后宮、海安宮、溫陵媽廟、古鹿耳門媽祖廟等等）多由府城三郊管理，此外清朝晚期形成的府城迎（北港）媽祖活動，串聯起北港到臺南沿途多座重要媽祖廟，也使得媽祖信仰更為繁盛:25、26。

日治時期
日治時期初期媽祖樓天后宮曾被挪作臺南警察署派出所，善化慶安宮曾被挪作灣裡警察署等:27，使得包括媽祖信仰在內的臺灣民間信仰都受到影響，直到1896年首任臺灣總督樺山資紀下令基於「保民治安」等理由，應妥為保護廟宇與傳統信仰，暫供軍用者也應速恢復舊貌，以及臺灣治安的恢復，各地寺廟才逐漸恢復宗教活動:27。1915年西來庵事件發生後，為避免再次有人利用宗教信仰號召群眾抗日，開針對臺灣宗教進行調查，其成果由臺灣總督府編修官丸井圭治郎在1919年彙編成《臺灣宗教調查報告書》，該書除了提供政府施政的參考資料外，也成為日後進行臺灣宗教調查的範本:28。而在日本大正年間，由於政府利用廟會慶典促進地方繁榮，所以大力支持迎神賽會，歷如1923年5月15日的《臺灣日日新報》便報導臺南州知事吉岡荒造等官員參與臺南大天后宮與祀典武廟同日舉行的祭典:28。然而1937年中日戰爭爆發後，展開的皇民化運動企圖以日本神道教來取代臺灣的其他宗教，1938年的「寺廟整理運動」據臺北帝國大學教授宮本延人統計，全臺有361座廟宇被毀，819座廟宇被移作他用，媽祖信仰與其他民間信仰一樣受到打擊:31。

戰後時期
來臺的中華民國軍隊如同當初日軍來臺一樣，佔用各地廟宇，如臺南大天后宮在1945年10月被62軍軍眷佔住，引發民眾不滿，對此石覺將軍在1949年下令軍眷不得佔住廟宇以免引發更多的民怨:32。而後在白色恐怖時期臺灣的宗教信仰自由受到限制，廟會活動被視為迷信、鋪張浪費的活動而遭到禁止，為此國民黨政府還在1963年頒發了〈臺灣省改善民間習俗辦法〉:32。但即使受到限制，各地廟宇仍有變通辦法，例如讓宗教慶典與政治活動結合，像是臺南的媽祖樓與金安宮便曾以「開國紀念」的名義來藉機進行遶境活動:33。
1970年代臺灣經濟蓬勃發展，民間開始大量重修、擴建廟宇，原本僅於私宅或是神明會供奉的祀神也開始建廟，使得臺灣廟宇數量大幅增加:34。而後由於1987年解除戒嚴，臺灣與中國大陸恢復交流，有不少臺灣媽祖廟將原本的進香地點改為福建湄洲媽祖廟，並從湄洲分香回臺:34。而原本湄洲媽祖祖廟在文化大革命中受到破壞，在臺灣各媽祖廟捐輸下除了得以重建之外，1998年更開始增建南軸線上的建築群:35。除了湄洲媽祖廟外，福建的賢良港天后祖祠、泉州天后宮、莆田文峰宮也有得到臺灣各媽祖廟的捐助:35。
臺灣媽祖信仰在傳播多年後逐漸在地化，例如各地的媽祖常會稱為「某某媽」，像是鹿港媽、大甲媽、關渡媽、北港媽、鹿耳門媽、茄苳媽、梧棲大庄媽、桃園媽、板橋媽、新莊媽等等；而除了在地化，臺灣的媽祖信仰也有向海外發展，並分靈回中國大陸，由台商在昆山新建慧聚天后宮，並依照鹿港天后宮格局，分靈鹿港天后宮媽祖至昆山慧聚天后宮恭奉:36。

分靈
分靈也稱為分香，係指地方新建廟宇，或者信徒欲在自宅供奉某一尊神明時，先到歷史悠久、神蹟靈驗的大廟去求取神明的靈力。經過特殊的儀式之後，新塑的神像被視為祖廟神明的分身，具有相近的靈力，但是每年必須重新回到祖廟來進香、刈火，方能保持靈力不衰。媽祖信仰因為分靈與進香等宗教活動，形成特殊的層級譜系。分靈習俗並非媽祖信仰獨有，但其影響力以媽祖最钜。
民間信仰中，神明是非常繁忙的，多在天庭或者原鄉。所以分靈的神像，並不是該神祇本人，而是該神的部屬，或者該神挑選之當地有功德的先人。如臺中萬和宮媽祖廟奉祀的「老二媽」神像，就是當地一位廖姓少女的魂魄來附靈的媽祖。
在臺灣，大凡歷史較為悠久的媽祖廟，都會成為鄰近地區媽祖廟和信徒自宅供奉媽祖的祖廟，層層分靈傳布出去後，形成一個蛛網密佈的信仰系統，並且透過熱鬧的進香、刈火儀式，強化信仰的深度。信徒們也普遍相信，層級較高的媽祖廟，其神力靈感也較為強大（這個情況在其他地區則較不明顯）。
因為這樣的層級觀念，臺灣許多媽祖廟對於自身在層級中的地位錙銖必較，民國四十年代（1950年代）以後，臺灣的各大媽祖廟之間開始有誰才是「開台媽」的爭論。只要是規模較大的媽祖廟，無不在山門上大書「開基媽祖」或「開台媽祖」，標榜自己的香火乃是直接從福建湄洲祖廟而來。
這種對於主從關係的爭論，有時會造成宮廟之間的不睦。知名的遶境路線有雲林縣北港朝天宮和臺中市大甲鎮瀾宮。但在1988年，因為朝天宮單方面使用「媽祖回娘家」等字眼，並且無中生有地宣稱「大甲媽是北港媽的分靈」，引起大甲鎮瀾宮抗議，最後遂將「北港進香」活動改稱「遶境進香」，並將路線改往新港奉天宮。

正統笨港媽之爭
新港奉天宮與北港朝天宮的爭論歷史更早，據說清朝時北港溪改道，沖毀古笨港街，也沖毀了當時的廟宇，因此在笨港街原址河道北岸重建的北港朝天宮，堅持自己為笨港媽正統。而原本在南岸聚集的人們，後遷至現新港之處建立的新港奉天宮，則宣稱洪水將原廟宇的4尊媽祖（開台媽、大媽、二媽、三媽）神像沖至南岸，並被其保有。除此之外，尚有爭論兩廟持有之媽祖分別是原天后宮媽祖中的哪一尊，此一順位之爭。
另外，彰化南瑤宮係源自雍正年間窯工楊謙自笨港攜去之香火，而後南瑤宮為感念其之功勞，往笨港（水災後改為新港、北港）謁祖進香時期媽祖必訪楊家，楊家不堪此大禮因而自南瑤宮再分靈媽祖一尊供奉於家，以將「神對人」之屈尊謁拜改為「神對神」之同格進香。之後楊家媽祖先改奉於新港水仙宮，直到2002年起於水仙宮旁新建一天后宮，承襲古名命名為笨港天后宮，並將古笨港天后宮之廟史納入其自身廟史。
因此前述笨港地區之朝天宮、奉天宮及天后宮皆各自標榜繼承了「古笨港媽祖」的正統。
附帶一提，亦有承襲笨港媽祖正統的廟宇，尚有位於新港鄉溪北村之溪北六興宮。該廟傳說源於笨港水災後，約道光17年（1837年）北港與新港正統之爭之初，為試圖平息這場爭端，由新港當地出身之福建水師提督銜太子少保的王得祿將軍出面協調，最後決定一尊留新港、一尊返北港，第三尊之正三媽（尚有一尊無提及）則由王得祿請回自家村裡奉於提督公館，王死後即改為溪北六興宮。該廟雖亦為承襲笨港媽祖正統，但較無參與正統之爭，規模亦較小較不為人知，直到近年因電視連續劇「黑面媽祖」播映造成風行方較有名氣。
位於新港鄉板頭村之笨港長天宮，傳說由顏思齊自湄洲至此，並於笨港溪邊興建天妃宮。1734年（清雍正12年）因地勢危險遷移至板頭厝。該廟雖亦承襲笨港媽祖正統，但較無參與正統之爭，規模亦較小較不為人知。
然而，對於信徒來說，宮廟之間的爭執並不造成信仰上的差別。隨著媽祖信仰的影響力提升，各重要媽祖廟舉辦的宗教活動，往往成為強力的社會動員，乃至於沾染上政治色彩。

最早分靈的案例
目前臺灣島內分靈最久遠，應為西螺社口福天宮從嘉義朴子配天宮所分靈之老二媽；而西螺社口福天宮廟內目前存有一塊「大正十五年」的路關圖，證明當時有大規模往配天宮謁祖進香；民國72年(1983年)連續謁祖進香三年，因建廟經費有限再度中斷。民國85年(1996年)媽祖領旨重啟遶境周圍地區一天（社口、新社、魚寮、七座等地）；民國88年(1999年)擴大遶境西螺地區三天；民國89年(2002)年重啟往祖廟嘉義朴子配天宮謁祖進香，目前模式是起駕後搭車前往北港大橋下車，於六腳、朴子地區徒步遶巡沿路村庄。

媽祖傳說
清朝歷史學家趙翼記下了一個很有趣的臺灣海峽的媽祖傳說。若遇海難向神明呼救時，稱「媽祖」，媽祖就會立刻不施脂粉來救人。若稱「天妃」則媽祖就盛裝打扮，雍容華貴地來救人，所以會很晚才到。故海上都稱「媽祖」，不敢稱「天妃」，希望媽祖立刻來救海難中的漁船。

臺灣的媽祖傳說，大概都是媽祖用裙擺擋下第二次世界大戰的美軍空投炸彈。
1943年二戰期間，美國軍機曾飛臨鹿港上空投下數百磅重的炸彈，發生所謂「崎仔腳爆擊事件」。
當時主要對電機廠房及航運站進行轟炸，在 崎仔腳 (今中山路順興里、員林客運公司一帶) 投下數百顆的炸彈造成六十多人炸死、數百人受傷。防護團將屍體堆放在街役場 (今鎮公所) 廣場上讓人認屍。係第二次世界大戰中鹿港古城死傷最慘重的一次。
傳說美軍空襲曾投下數百顆的炸彈，但僅少數幾顆命中爆炸，其餘的都投進鹿港海邊沙灘上，成為未爆炸的啞彈，乃拜受媽祖顯靈所賜。據傳一名參與行動的美軍老空軍人見聞，其人於戰後初年曾到鹿港觀光，到天后宮瞻仰媽祖聖像，發現與當時他在機上見一飛天白衣神女飄行天空，以長裙承接炸彈、將之拋移至海灘軟地。女神面貌猶似天后宮媽祖，遂將其遭遇向導遊的鹿港友人述說。媽祖化身救難故事，於焉傳開。
朴子配天宮也有同樣的故事，二戰期間盟軍丟了一顆飛彈在朴子街上水塔附近，配天宮媽祖用裙擺將飛彈接住丟入朴子溪中，使得朴子街免受戰火的波及。，雲林西螺、彰化縣埤頭合興宮、東螺開基祖廟北斗奠安宮、屏東縣萬丹萬惠宮、台南市鹽水護庇宮、雲林縣崙背奉天宮也有相似的傳說。
也有媽祖讓孩童起死回生等傳說。北港朝天宮、大甲鎮瀾宮、彰化南瑤宮、新港奉天宮都有媽祖顯靈讓兒童死而復活的神蹟，傳說大意是：有一女性香客揹著兒子（或曰孫子）一同前往，在進香途中其子（或孫）因中暑突然暴斃，女香客不得已祇得暫時將其屍體放置在廟後草寮中（或曰樹林下），待進香返回時再做處理。不料回程時竟遍尋不到其屍首，女香客無可奈何祇得趕回家中，待其返抵家門，竟見其兒（或孫）正在門口遊玩。詢問其經過，孩童說是有一位阿姨帶他回家，乃知是媽祖顯靈讓小孩死而復活。眾所皆知，人死當然不能復生，此一神蹟乃表示媽祖之神通廣大，能使死者復活。

媽祖生
在臺灣，媽祖生可分為兩類。
第一類為民間廣泛流傳的農曆三月二十三日
每年農曆三月二十三日天上聖母媽祖的誕辰。
在這一天，各地的媽祖廟都會張燈結彩、演戲並伴隨盛大的祭典，非常熱鬧。
而其中又以白沙屯媽祖、大甲媽祖、北港媽祖以及鹿港媽祖最具代表性。
第二類則為農曆四月初十至十六日，其代表便為雲林縣六房天上聖母

馬祖的媽祖信仰
根據清初《使琉球記》中記載，媽祖林默娘28歲時因父兄駕船駛至閩江口海域，遇風浪船毀人溺，媽祖為救父兄入海罹難，她的遺體當年隨海漂至閩江口附近的小島（即今日馬祖列島的南竿島），為漁民打撈上岸，並將她葬在岸邊。湄洲島的鄉親一度以為默娘失蹤沒下落，故稱她已羽化昇天成仙，且為感念其孝心，遂蓋廟紀念她的孝行。經後代學者查知，媽祖葬於現今馬祖南竿鄉馬祖天后宮內靈穴石棺中，且興廟供奉媽祖世代相傳至今，成為馬祖居民最重要的信仰之一。此島因而被稱為媽祖島，爾後中華民國國軍進駐為顯陽剛去掉女字旁改稱為馬祖島，遂沿用至今。
清初張學禮所著《使琉球紀》中記載「通官謝必振稟云： 『天妃姓蔡，此地人；為父投海身亡，後封天妃。本朝定鼎，尚未封』。」
「媽祖投海救父身亡」的流傳，極可能是馬祖當地將蔡姑婆（蔡紅亨）的傳說與媽祖（林默）信仰混淆加工後出現。
目前馬祖馬港的馬祖天后宮仍可看見媽祖的靈穴，且從未移動過，據說每次有意移動，都會有一些不可思議事件發生。如1963年國軍因辦理伙食時不慎發生火災，燒了部分廟體，為平息眾怒而承諾改建，工兵在施工時無意將地磚舖過靈穴，隔天地磚離奇地全部破碎；2001年的改建，施工單位原本怕破壞靈穴所在，打算暫時遷移，但鑽地的地鑽卻突然斷裂；而最近一次，也就是改建落成時，廟方原本想為靈穴塗上油彩，但奇怪的是，任何塗漆都難以上色，經擲筊請示，媽祖做了保持靈穴原樣原色的指示。而靈穴就在香案前方，為保護靈穴，廟方也裝上了強化玻璃。
目前廟殿供奉著福建馬祖籍登山怪傑李小石攀登珠穆朗瑪峰（聖母峰）時，所揹帶的媽祖金身聖像。
馬港天后宮是南竿鄉的信仰中心，據說，每次有大災難之前，都會見到由靈穴飛出一團火球，當地居民說看到火球飛出，就知道媽祖娘娘又出去救海難了。
2009年，高達28.8公尺的媽祖巨石像正式於馬港天后宮旁揭幕，不僅全部以花崗岩打造，而且也成功挑戰世界第一高的金氏世界紀錄，28.8公尺的高度對照馬祖的總面積28.8公頃，象徵著媽祖將守護馬祖每吋土地上的子民，更強化「媽祖在馬祖」的意涵。
連江縣政府近來於每年農曆九月初九重陽節舉辦「媽祖在馬祖--昇天祭」，以「媽祖在馬祖」作為招徠觀光客之口號與行動，也讓世人以此感念媽祖孝順慈愛的精神。

臺灣媽祖廟分布
分靈名稱
臺灣則有3000多座以上媽祖廟，因地而異，且名稱說法不一。由於媽祖神像來自於福建省等不同地方，由於不同人們去奉請，所以名稱說法也盡不相同；來自湄洲島分香者稱湄洲媽，來自泉州三邑分香者稱溫陵媽，來自同安縣分香者稱銀同媽，來自安溪縣分香者稱清溪媽，來自漳浦縣分香者稱烏石媽。

各地名廟概述
全臺各地因不同起建年代、地域、背景，而有富饒地方采風、傳說的媽祖廟，早期有「南笨港、北干豆」一說，尊崇北港朝天宮與關渡宮。
臺灣具代表性的名剎如：
臺南市大天后宮為清代全台灣位階最高的官建大廟，第一座「天后宮」為名的媽祖廟，享有「全臺祀典」之稱。
三芝福成宮供奉原台北大天后宮的官祀金面媽祖。此外，金山慈護宮、士林慈諴宮有供奉全台少數官祀的金面媽祖。
臺北關渡宮在北臺灣各地都有迎請關渡媽做客的習俗與傳統。甚至擴展到中臺灣與南臺灣，關渡宮以開基大媽與開基軟身二媽神像最為靈驗，也為各地信徒主要迎請巡莊繞境的神像。
雲林北港朝天宮自日治時代以來為全台巨剎，被稱為「全台媽祖的總本山」。台灣諺語「北港香爐」一詞即形容宮內鼎盛香火。
彰化鹿港天后宮保存世界唯一湄洲天后宮開基媽祖神像本尊，一說新竹市新竹長和宮供奉湄洲祖廟正三媽。

大甲地區大甲鎮瀾宮則是每年農曆三月份的南下遶境活動頗具盛名，參加活動的人次更是逐年攀升，近年更已達500萬人次之譜參與遶境盛會。更被譽為「世界三大宗教盛事」之一。另外大甲媽亦有「見轎不跪，討皮痛」之語，因為清代時鎮瀾宮神轎出宮，除了老病殘弱者，信徒必定跪地迎送，否則會遭到隊伍帶頭者以「鶴旗」猛打。
梧棲區大庄浩天宮大肚中堡五十三庄境主顯聖庇祐神蹟廣傳，地方風調雨順、五穀豐收，大庄媽祖之盛名遠播，香客從各地絡繹不絕而來，於是信仰的區域從原本大庄轄區擴大及大肚中堡五十三庄。
「一府二鹿三艋舺、四月津港」的鹽水護庇宮開基三媽（糖郊媽）由明天啟（1623年）渡台奉祀（合祀於福德祠），鹽水港曾是倒風內海的總吞吐口岸，使得其信仰範圍涵蓋鹹水港保、太子宮保、龍蛟潭保、白鬚公潭保等地，號稱是72庄頭的信仰中心（今臺南市鹽水區、新營區、後壁區、嘉義縣布袋鎮、義竹鄉、鹿草鄉 等地），鹽水街區則有五郊七境分擔護庇宮費用。而這七街境後來又劃分成四角頭，鹽水護庇宮除了四角頭遶境之外，尚有不定期的南巡與北巡。

名廟概覽

Calvinism
Baptists
Baptists are the largest Protestant grouping in the United States accounting for one-third of all American Protestants.
Prior to 1845, most white Baptist churches were loosely affiliated as the Triennial Convention. In that year, most southern congregations left to form a new Southern Baptist Convention, which is now the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S., with 13.2 million members as of 2023. The remaining members organized what is now American Baptist Churches USA and includes 1.1 million members and 5,057 congregations.
African American Baptists, excluded from full participation in white Baptist organizations, have formed several denominations, of which the largest are the National Baptist Convention, and the more liberal Progressive National Baptist Convention.
There are numerous smaller bodies, some recently organized and others with long histories, such as the Calvinistic Baptists, General Baptists, Primitive Baptists, Old Regulars, Two-Seed-in-the-Spirit Predestinarian Baptists, independents, and Seventh Day Baptists.
Baptists have been present in the part of North America that is now the United States since the early 17th century. Both Roger Williams and John Clarke, his compatriot in working for religious freedom, are credited with founding the Baptist faith in North America. In 1639, Williams established a Baptist church in Providence, Rhode Island (First Baptist Church in America) and Clarke began a Baptist church in Newport, Rhode Island (First Baptist Church in Newport). According to a Baptist historian who has researched the matter, ""There is much debate over the centuries as to whether the Providence or Newport church deserved the place of 'first' Baptist congregation in America. Exact records for both congregations are lacking.""

Lutheranism
With 2.9 million members, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) is the largest American Lutheran denomination, followed by the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) with 1.7 million members, and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) with 344,000 members. The differences between the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) largely arise from historical and cultural factors, although some are theological in character. The ELCA tends to be more involved in ecumenical endeavors than the LCMS.
When Lutherans came to North America, they started church bodies that reflected, to some degree, the churches left behind. Many maintained their immigrant languages until the early 20th century. They sought pastors from the ""old country"" until patterns for the education of clergy could be developed in America. Eventually, seminaries and church colleges were established in many places to serve the Lutheran churches in North America and, initially, especially to prepare pastors to serve congregations.
The LCMS sprang from German immigrants fleeing the forced Prussian Union, who settled in the St. Louis area and has a continuous history since it was established in 1847. The LCMS is the second largest Lutheran church body in North America (1.8 million). It identifies itself as a church with an emphasis on biblical doctrine and faithful adherence to the historic Lutheran confessions. Insistence by some LCMS leaders on a strict reading of all passages of Scripture led to a rupture in the mid-1970s, which in turn resulted in the formation of the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, now part of the ELCA.
Although its strongly conservative views on theology and ethics might seem to make the LCMS politically compatible with other Evangelicals in the U.S., the LCMS as an organization largely eschews political activity, partly out of its strict understanding of the Lutheran distinction between the Two Kingdoms. It does, however, encourage its members to be politically active, and LCMS members are often involved in political organizations such as Lutherans for Life.
The earliest predecessor synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America was constituted on August 25, 1748, in Philadelphia. It was known as the Ministerium of Pennsylvania and Adjacent States. The ELCA is the product of a series of mergers and represents the largest (3.0 million members) Lutheran church body in North America. The ELCA was created in 1988 by the uniting of the 2.85-million-member Lutheran Church in America, 2.25-million-member American Lutheran Church, and the 100,000-member Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches. The ALC and LCA had come into being in the early 1960s, as a result of mergers of eight smaller ethnically based Lutheran bodies.
The ELCA, through predecessor church bodies, is a founding member of the Lutheran World Federation, World Council of Churches and the National Council of Churches USA. The LCMS, maintaining its position as a confessional church body emphasizing the importance of full agreement in the teachings of the Bible, does not belong to any of these. However, it is a member of the International Lutheran Council, made up of over 30 Lutheran Churches worldwide that support the confessional doctrines of the Bible and the Book of Concord. The WELS, along with the Evangelical Lutheran Synod (ELS), are part of the international Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference (CELC).

Pentecostalism
Pentecostalism is a renewalist religious movement within Protestantism, that places special emphasis on a direct personal experience of God through the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The term Pentecostal is derived from Pentecost, a Greek term describing the Jewish Feast of Weeks. For Christians, this event commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit and Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting the same kind of spiritual power, worship styles and teachings that were found in the early church.
Pentecostalism is an umbrella term that includes a wide range of different theological and organizational perspectives. As a result, there is no single central organization or church that directs the movement. Most Pentecostals consider themselves to be part of broader Christian groups; for example, most Pentecostals identify as Protestants. Many embrace the term Evangelical, while others prefer Restorationist. Pentecostalism is theologically and historically close to the Charismatic Movement, as it significantly influenced that movement; some Pentecostals use the two terms interchangeably.
Within classical Pentecostalism there are three major orientations: Wesleyan-Holiness, Higher Life, and Oneness. Examples of Wesleyan-Holiness denominations include the Church of God in Christ (COGIC) and the International Pentecostal Holiness Church (IPHC). The International Church of the Foursquare Gospel is an example of the Higher Life branch, while the Assemblies of God (AG) was influenced by both groups. Some Oneness Pentecostal (Nontrinitarian) churches include the United Pentecostal Church International (UPCI) and Pentecostal Assemblies of the World (PAW). Many Pentecostal sects are affiliated with the Pentecostal World Conference.

Assemblies of God, Evangelical

Mainline vs. evangelical
In typical usage, the term mainline is contrasted with evangelical. The distinction between the two can be due as much to sociopolitical attitude as to theological doctrine, although doctrinal differences may exist as well. Theologically conservative critics accuse the mainline churches of ""the substitution of leftist social action for Christian evangelizing, and the disappearance of biblical theology"", and maintain that ""All the Mainline churches have become essentially the same church: their histories, their theologies, and even much of their practice lost to a uniform vision of social progress.""
The Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) counts 26,344,933 members of mainline churches versus 39,930,869 members of evangelical Protestant churches. There is evidence of a shift in membership from mainline denominations to evangelical churches.
As shown in the table below, some denominations with similar names and historical ties to evangelical groups are considered mainline. For example, while the American Baptist Churches, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, and the Presbyterian Church (USA) are mainline, the Southern Baptist Convention, Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, and the Presbyterian Church in America are grouped as evangelical.  However, many confessional denominations within the Magisterial Protestant traditions (such as the LCMS for Lutheranism) do not accurately fit under either categorization.

Mainline Protestantism
Mainline Protestant Christian denominations are those Protestant denominations that were brought to the United States by its historic immigrant groups; for this reason they are sometimes referred to as heritage churches.
The largest are the Episcopal (English), Presbyterian (Scottish), Methodist (English and Welsh), and Lutheran (German and Scandinavian) churches.
Many mainline denominations teach that the Bible is God's word in function, but tend to be open to new ideas and societal changes. They have been increasingly open to the ordination of women.
Mainline churches tend to belong to organizations such as the National Council of Churches and World Council of Churches.
Mainline Protestant denominations, such as the Episcopal Church (76%), the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) (64%), and the United Church of Christ (46%), have the highest number of graduate and post-graduate degrees per capita of any other Christian denomination in the United States, as well as the most high-income earners.
Episcopalians and Presbyterians tend to be considerably wealthier and better educated than most other religious groups in Americans, and are disproportionately represented in the upper reaches of American business, law and politics, especially the Republican Party. Numbers of the most wealthy and affluent American families as the Vanderbilts and Astors, Rockefeller, Du Pont, Roosevelt, Forbes, Whitneys, Morgans and Harrimans are Mainline Protestantism families.

Evangelicalism
Evangelicalism is a Protestant Christian movement in which adherents consider its key characteristics to be a belief in the need for personal conversion (or being ""born again""), some expression of the gospel in effort, a high regard for Biblical authority and an emphasis on the death and resurrection of Jesus. David Bebbington has termed these four distinctive aspects ""conversionism"", ""activism"", ""biblicism"", and ""crucicentrism"", saying, ""Together they form a quadrilateral of priorities that is the basis of Evangelicalism.""
Note that the term ""evangelical"" does not equal Christian fundamentalism, although the latter is sometimes regarded simply as the most theologically conservative subset of the former. The major differences largely hinge upon views of how to regard and approach scripture (""Theology of Scripture""), as well as construing its broader world-view implications. While most conservative evangelicals believe the label has broadened too much beyond its more limiting traditional distinctives, this trend is nonetheless strong enough to create significant ambiguity in the term. As a result, the dichotomy between ""evangelical"" vs. ""mainline"" denominations is increasingly complex (particularly with such innovations as the ""emergent church"" movement).
The contemporary North American usage of the term is influenced by the evangelical/fundamentalist controversy of the early 20th century. Evangelicalism may sometimes be perceived as the middle ground between the theological liberalism of the mainline denominations and the cultural separatism of fundamentalist Christianity. Evangelicalism has therefore been described as ""the third of the leading strands in American Protestantism, straddl[ing] the divide between fundamentalists and liberals."" While the North American perception is important to understand the usage of the term, it by no means dominates a wider global view, where the fundamentalist debate was not so influential.
Evangelicals held the view that the modernist and liberal parties in the Protestant churches had surrendered their heritage as evangelicals by accommodating the views and values of the world. At the same time, they criticized their fellow fundamentalists for their separatism and their rejection of the Social Gospel as it had been developed by Protestant activists of the previous century. They charged the modernists with having lost their identity as evangelicals and the fundamentalists with having lost the Christ-like heart of evangelicalism. They argued that the Gospel needed to be reasserted to distinguish it from the innovations of the liberals and the fundamentalists.
They sought allies in denominational churches and liturgical traditions, disregarding views of eschatology and other ""non-essentials,"" and joined also with Trinitarian varieties of Pentecostalism. They believed that in doing so, they were simply re-acquainting Protestantism with its own recent tradition. The movement's aim at the outset was to reclaim the evangelical heritage in their respective churches, not to begin something new; and for this reason, following their separation from fundamentalists, the same movement has been better known merely as ""Evangelicalism."" By the end of the 20th century, this was the most influential development in American Protestant Christianity.
The National Association of Evangelicals is a U.S. agency which coordinates cooperative ministry for its member denominations.

Protestantism and American education
According of Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States by Harriet Zuckerman, a review of American Nobel prizes winners awarded between 1901 and 1972, 72% of American Nobel Prize laureates have identified from Protestant background. Overall, 84.2% of all the Nobel Prizes awarded to Americans in Chemistry, 60% in Medicine, and 58.6% in Physics between 1901 and 1972 were won by Protestants.
Some of the first colleges and universities in America, including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Brown,  Dartmouth, Rutgers, Williams, Bowdoin, Middlebury, and Amherst, all were founded by  Protestants, as were later Carleton, Duke, Oberlin, Beloit, Pomona, Rollins and Colorado College.

A Gallup survey from 2023 indicates that of the entire U.S. population (332 million) about 67% is Christian (224 million). The majority of Christian Americans are Protestant Christians (140 million; 44%), though there are also significant numbers of American Roman Catholics (70 million; 22%) and other Christian denominations such as Latter Day Saints, Eastern Orthodox Christians, Oriental Orthodox Christians, and Jehovah's Witnesses (about 13 million in total; 4%). The United States has the largest Christian population in the world and, more specifically, the largest Protestant population in the world, with nearly 210 million Christians and, as of 2021, over 140 million people affiliated with Protestant churches, although other countries have higher percentages of Christians among their populations. The Public Religion Research Institute's ""2020 Census of American Religion"", carried out between 2014 and 2020, showed that 70% of Americans identified as Christian during this seven-year interval. In a 2020 survey by the Pew Research Center, 65% of adults in the United States identified themselves as Christians. They were 75% in 2015, 70.6% in 2014, 78% in 2012, 81.6% in 2001, and 85% in 1990. About 62% of those polled claim to be members of a church congregation. The 2023-2024 Pew Religious Landscape Survey in the United States found that 40% identitied as Protestant and 19% as Catholic.
All Protestant denominations accounted for 48.5% of the population, making Protestantism the most common form of Christianity in the country and the majority religion in general in the United States, while the Catholic Church by itself, at 22.7% of the population, is the largest individual denomination. The nation's second-largest denomination and the single largest Protestant denomination is the Southern Baptist Convention. Among Eastern Christian denominations, there are several Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches, with just below 1 million adherents in the U.S., or 0.4% of the total population. Christianity is the predominant religion in all U.S. states and territories. Conversion into Christianity has significantly increased among Korean Americans, Chinese Americans, and Japanese Americans in the United States. In 2012, the percentage of Christians in these communities were 71%, 30% and 37% respectively.
Christianity was introduced to the Americas during European settlement beginning in the 16th and 17th centuries. Immigration further increased Christian numbers. Going forward from its foundation, the United States has been called a Protestant nation by a variety of sources. When the categories of ""irreligion"" and ""unaffiliated"" are included as religious categories for statistical purposes, Protestantism is technically no longer the religious category of the majority; however, this is primarily the result of an increase in Americans, such as Americans of Protestant descent or background, professing no religious affiliation, rather than being the result of an increase in non-Protestant religious affiliations, and Protestantism remains by far the majority or dominant form of religion in the United States among American Christians and those Americans who declare a religion affiliation.

Major denominational families
Christian denominations in the United States are usually divided into three large groups: two types of Protestantism (Evangelical and Mainline) and Catholicism. There are also Christian denominations, making up a smaller percentage, that do not fall within the confines of these groups, such as Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy and various restorationist groups such as the Latter Day Saint movement, Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses.
A 2004 survey of the United States identified the percentages of these groups as 26.3% (Evangelical), 17.5% (Catholics), and 16% (Mainline); the other groups made up 2.7%. In a Statistical Abstract of the United States, based on a 2001 study of the self-described religious identification of the adult population, the percentages for these same groups are 28.6% (Evangelical), 24.5% (Catholics), and 13.9% (Mainline). Christian religious groups made up 76.5% of the total population, while the other religious groups account for 3.7%. According the 2020 ARDA Database, there were approximately 60 million Christians independent from denominations.

Protestantism
In typical usage, the term mainline is contrasted with evangelical.
The Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) counts 26,344,933 members of mainline churches versus 39,930,869 members of evangelical Protestant churches. There is evidence that there has been a shift in membership from mainline denominations to evangelical churches. Additionally, ARDA's 2010 study indicated Baptists were the largest Protestant group throughout the United States, followed by non-denominational Protestants. By 2014, the Pew Research Center determined non- and inter-denominational Protestants became the second-largest Christian group with Baptists third. ARDA's 2020 religion census also counted the movement as overtaking Baptists, making up more than 13.1% of the religious population and 6.4% of the general population.
As shown in the table below (from 2015), some denominations with similar names and historical ties to Evangelical groups are considered Mainline.

Evangelical Protestantism
Evangelicalism is a Protestant Christian movement. In typical usage, the term mainline is contrasted with evangelical. Most adherents consider the key characteristics of evangelicalism to be: a belief in the need for personal conversion (or being ""born again""); some expression of the gospel in effort; a high regard for Biblical authority; and an emphasis on the death and resurrection of Jesus. David Bebbington has termed these four distinctive aspects conversionism, activism, biblicism, and crucicentrism, saying, ""Together they form a quadrilateral of priorities that is the basis of Evangelicalism.""
Note that the term ""Evangelical"" does not equal Fundamentalist Christianity, although the latter is sometimes regarded simply as the most theologically conservative subset of the former. The major differences largely hinge upon views of how to regard and approach scripture (""Theology of Scripture""), as well as construing its broader world-view implications. While most conservative Evangelicals believe the label has broadened too much beyond its more limiting traditional distinctives, this trend is nonetheless strong enough to create significant ambiguity in the term.

Historically, Evangelicals held the view that modernist and liberal parties in the Protestant churches had compromised Christian teachings by accommodating the views and values of the secular world. At the same time, they criticized Fundamentalists for their separatism and rejection of the Social Gospel as it had been developed by Protestant activists during the previous century. They argued that the core Gospel and its message needed to be reasserted to distinguish it from the innovations and traditions of the liberals and fundamentalists.
They sought allies in denominational churches and liturgical traditions, disregarding views of eschatology and other ""non-essentials,"" and joined also with Trinitarian varieties of Pentecostalism. They believed that in doing so, they were simply re-acquainting Protestantism with its own recent tradition. The movement's aim at the outset was to reclaim the Evangelical heritage in their respective churches, not to begin something new; and for this reason, following their separation from Fundamentalists, the same movement has been better known merely as ""Evangelicalism."" By the end of the 20th century, this was the most influential development in American Protestant Christianity.
The National Association of Evangelicals is a U.S. agency which coordinates cooperative ministry for its member denominations.
A 2015 study estimated that the U.S. has about 450,000 Christians from a Muslim background, most of whom are evangelicals or Pentecostals.

Mainline Protestantism
The mainline Protestant Christian denominations are those Protestant denominations that were brought to the United States by its historic immigrant groups; for this reason, they are sometimes referred to as heritage churches. The largest are the Episcopal (English), Presbyterian (Scottish), Methodist (English and Welsh), and Lutheran (German and Scandinavian) churches.
Mainline Protestantism, including the Episcopalians (76%), the Presbyterians (64%), and the United Church of Christ has the highest number of graduate and post-graduate degrees per capita, of any Christian denomination in the United States, as well as the most high-income earners.
Episcopalians and Presbyterians tend to be considerably wealthier and better educated than most other religious groups among Americans, and are disproportionately represented in the upper reaches of American business, law and politics, especially the Republican Party. Numbers of the most wealthy and affluent American families as the Vanderbilts and Astors, Rockefeller, Du Pont, Roosevelt, Forbes, Whitney, Morgans, and Harrimans are historically Mainline Protestant families.
According to Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States by Harriet Zuckerman, a review of American Nobel prizes winners awarded between 1901 and 1972, 72% of American Nobel Prize laureates, have identified from a Protestant background. Overall, 84.2% of all the Nobel Prizes awarded to Americans in Chemistry, 60% in Medicine, and 58.6% in Physics between 1901 and 1972 were won by Protestants.
Some of the first colleges and universities in America, including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Dartmouth, Williams, Bowdoin, Middlebury, and Amherst, all were founded by the Mainline Protestants, as were later Carleton, Duke, Oberlin, Beloit, Pomona, Rollins and Colorado College. Most of these schools, however, identify themselves as independent and non-sectarian institutions, having no juridical ties to formal religion.
Many mainline denominations teach that the Bible is God's word in function, but tend to be open to new ideas and societal changes. They have been increasingly open to the ordination of women.
Mainline churches tend to belong to organizations such as the National Council of Churches and World Council of Churches.
The seven largest U.S. mainline Protestant denominations were called by William Hutchison the ""Seven Sisters of American Protestantism"" in reference to the major liberal groups during the period between 1900 and 1960.
These include:

United Methodist Church: 5,424,175 members (2022)
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America: 2,793,899 members (2023)
Episcopal Church in the United States of America: 1,394,769 active baptized members (2023)
American Baptist Churches in the USA: 1,145,647 members (2017)
Presbyterian Church (USA): 1,094,733 active members (2023)
United Church of Christ: 712,296 members (2022)
Christian Church (Disciples of Christ): 277,864 (2022)
The Association of Religion Data Archives also considers these denominations to be mainline:

Religious Society of Friends (Quakers): 108,500 members
Reformed Church in America: 84,957 members (2023)
International Council of Community Churches: 68,300 members (2010)
National Association of Congregational Christian Churches: 65,569 members (2000)
North American Baptist Conference: 47,150 members (2006)
Moravian Church in America, Southern Province: 21,513 members (1991)
Moravian Church in America, Northern Province: 20,220 members (2010)
Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches: 15,666 members (2006)
Latvian Evangelical Lutheran Church in America: 12,000 members (2007)
Congregational Christian Churches (not part of any national CCC body)
Moravian Church in America, Alaska Province
The Association of Religion Data Archives has difficulties collecting data on traditionally African American denominations. Those churches most likely to be identified as mainline include these Methodist groups:

African Methodist Episcopal Church
Christian Methodist Episcopal Church
The Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church, an Oriental Protestant body in the Saint Thomas Christian tradition, also has congregations in the United States. This church is in full communion with the Anglican Communion. Hence, the Association of Religion Data Archives groups the Mar Thoma Church with Anglican churches.

Catholic Church
The Catholic Church arrived in what is now the continental United States during the earliest days of the European colonization of the Americas. It secured and established itself formally as early as 1565, with the establishment of the first Catholic parish of the United States at St. Augustine, Florida. It spread in the 1600s through missionaries including Jesuit missionaries like Eusebio Kino, Jacques Marquette, Isaac Jogues and Andrew White. At the time the country was founded (meaning the Thirteen Colonies in 1776, along the Atlantic seaboard), only a small fraction of the population there were Catholic, mostly in Maryland, a ""Catholic Proprietary,"" established in 1634 by the second Lord Baltimore, Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore; however, as a result of expansion in former French, Spanish and Mexican (i.e., purchase of Louisiana Territory, of Florida, the acquisition of territory after the Mexican–American War) territories, and immigration over the country's history, the number of adherents has grown dramatically and it is now the largest denomination in the United States today. With over 67 million registered residents professing the faith in 2008, the United States has the fourth largest Catholic population in the world after Brazil, Mexico, and the Philippines, respectively.
The Church's leadership body in the United States is the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, made up of the hierarchy of bishops and archbishops of the United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands, although each bishop is independent in his own diocese, answerable only to the Pope.
No primate for Catholics exists in the United States. The Archdiocese of Baltimore has Prerogative of Place, which confers to its archbishop a subset of the leadership responsibilities granted to primates in other countries, possibly because at the time it was created an archdiocese (and metropolitan see) in 1808, four newly created dioceses (Boston, New York, Bardstown [KY], and Philadelphia) were subject to it. In addition, the ""principal determining elements in the character of American Catholicism"" seemed to coalesce under the leadership of Archbishop John Carroll of Baltimore (the first bishop of the United States, consecrated in London, 1790) and his native Maryland Catholics, descendants of the original Catholic families of Maryland's Catholic Proprietary. In this regard, Baltimore had, among other things, a ""prerogative of place,"" both historically and culturally, in the American Catholic mind and in Rome. This would change, of course, with immigration and the acquisition of new territories that currently make up continental U.S. It is important to note, however, the openness of Carroll to the American experiment. As early as 1784, he ""wholeheartedly"" affirmed the pattern of church-state relations then emerging in the new country, later to be incorporated into the Constitution. He also praised the promise which civil and religious liberty held out for all denominations, noting in an address to Catholics (Annapolis, MD), that ""if we have the wisdom and temper to preserve, America may come to exhibit a proof to the world, that general and equal toleration, by giving a free circulation to fair argument, is the most effectual method to bring all denominations of Christians to a unity of faith.""
The number of Catholics grew from the early 19th century through immigration and the acquisition of the predominantly Catholic former possessions of France, Spain, and Mexico, followed in the mid-19th century by a rapid influx of Irish, German, Italian and Polish immigrants from Europe, making Catholicism the largest Christian denomination in the United States. This increase was met by widespread prejudice and hostility, often resulting in riots and the burning of churches, convents, and seminaries. The integration of Catholics into American society was marked by the election of John F. Kennedy as president in 1960. Since then, the percentage of Americans who are Catholic has remained at around 25%.
According to the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities in 2011, there are approximately 230 Roman Catholic universities and colleges in the United States with nearly 1 million students and some 65,000 professors. 12 Catholic universities are listed among the top 100 national universities in the US. Catholic schools educate 2.7 million students in the United States, employing 150,000 teachers. In 2002, Catholic health care systems, overseeing 625 hospitals with a combined revenue of 30 billion dollars, comprised the nation's largest group of nonprofit systems.

Eastern Orthodox Christianity
Groups of immigrants from several different regions, mainly Eastern Europe and the Middle East, brought Eastern Orthodoxy to the United States. This traditional branch of Eastern Christianity has since spread beyond the boundaries of ethnic immigrant communities and now include multi-ethnic membership and parishes. Currently, there are between 6 and 7 million Eastern Christians in the United States of America. There are several Eastern Orthodox ecclesiastical jurisdictions in the US, organized within the Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of the United States of America. Statistically, Eastern Orthodox Christians are among the wealthiest Christian denominations in the United States, and they also tend to be better educated than most other religious groups in America, in the sense that they have a high number of graduate (68%) and post-graduate degrees (28%) per capita.

Oriental Orthodox Christianity
Several groups of Christian immigrants, mainly from the Middle East, Caucasus, Africa and India, brought Oriental Orthodoxy to the United States.
This ancient branch of Eastern Christianity includes several ecclesiastical jurisdictions in the US, including the Armenian Apostolic Church in the United States, the Coptic Orthodox Church in the United States, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the Eritrean Orthodox Church, the Syriac Orthodox Church, and the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church.

Latter Day Saint movement
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a nontrinitarian restorationist denomination. The church is headquartered in Salt Lake City, and is the largest originating from the Latter Day Saint movement which was founded by Joseph Smith in Upstate New York in 1830. It forms the majority in Utah, the plurality in Idaho, and high percentages in Nevada, Arizona, and Wyoming; in addition to sizable numbers in Colorado, Montana, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Hawaii and California. Current membership in the U.S. is 6.7 million and total membership is 16.7 million worldwide, as of December 2020.
In 2021, around 12–13% of Latter-day Saints lived in Utah, the center of cultural influence for the Latter Day Saint movement. Utah Latter-day Saints (as well as Latter-day Saints living in the Intermountain West) are on average more culturally and politically conservative and Libertarian than those living in some cosmopolitan centers elsewhere in the U.S. Utahns self-identifying as Latter-day Saints also attend church somewhat more on average than Latter-day Saints living in other states. (Nonetheless, whether they live in Utah or elsewhere in the U.S., Latter-day Saints tend to be more culturally and politically conservative than members of other U.S. religious groups.) Utah Latter-day Saints often place a greater emphasis on pioneer heritage than international Latter-day Saints who generally are not descendants of the early Latter-day Saint pioneers.
Community of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) is a trinitarian restorationist denomination based in Independence, Missouri, at the theologically significant Temple Lot. Community of Christ is the second largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement with 130,000 members in the United States and 250,000 worldwide (See Community of Christ membership statistics). The church owns some of the early Latter Day Saint historic sites and documents, and prior to March 2024 also owned the Kirtland Temple, near Cleveland, Ohio, and most of the Joseph Smith properties in Nauvoo, Illinois. Community of Christ has taken an ecumenical and progressive approach recent years including joining the National Council of Churches, ordaining women to the church's priesthood since 1984, and more recently approving the blessing of same-sex marriages.
Small churches within the Latter Day Saint movement include Church of Christ (Temple Lot), Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Restoration Branches, and Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

History
Christianity was introduced during the period of European colonization. The Spanish and French brought Catholicism to the colonies of New Spain and New France respectively, while British and Germans introduced Protestantism. Among Protestants, adherents to Anglicanism, the Baptist Church, Calvinism, Congregationalism, Presbyterianism, Lutheranism, Quakerism, Anabaptism, Methodism, and Moravian Church were the first to settle in the American colonies.

Early colonial period
The Dutch founded the colony of New Netherland in 1624; they established the Dutch Reformed Church as the colony's official religion in 1628. When Sweden established New Sweden in the Delaware River Valley in 1638, Church of Sweden was the colony's religion.

Spanish colonies
Spain established missions and towns in what are now Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Florida, and California. Many cities and towns still retain the names of the Catholic saints these missions were named for; an excellent example of this is the full legal name of the city of Los Angeles: El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora Reina de Los Ángeles del Río Porciúncula, or The Town of Our Lady, Queen of the Angels of the Porciuncula River. The city was founded by Franciscan friars, who named their tiny church and later the town that formed around it after the Virgin Mary, also known to Catholics as Our Lady, Queen of the Angels. Similar patterns emerged wherever the Spanish went, such as San Antonio, Texas (named for Anthony of Padua), Santa Fe, New Mexico (named after Francis of Assisi,) and Saint Augustine, Florida (named for Augustine of Hippo), as was Saint Lucy County and Port Saint Lucy in Florida named for Saint Lucy/Santa Lucia although Saint Petersburg, Florida was not named for St. Peter, but for the city of the same name in Russia.
Conversion of Native Americans to Catholicism was a main goal of the Catholic missionaries, especially the Jesuits. This was common in places where French influence was strong, like Detroit or Louisiana. However, Christianity is also implicated in the deaths of one third of the indigenous population of California.

British colonies
Many of the British North American colonies that eventually formed the United States of America were settled in the 17th century by men and women, who, in the face of European religious persecution, refused to compromise passionately-held religious convictions and fled Europe.

Virginia
An Anglican chaplain was among the first group of English colonists, arriving in 1607. The Church of England was legally established in the colony in 1619; with a total of 22 Anglican clergymen having arrived by 1624. In practice, ""establishment"" meant that local taxes were funneled through the local parish to handle the needs of local government, such as roads and poor relief, in addition to the salary of the minister. There never was a bishop in colonial Virginia; the local vestry consisted of laymen controlled the parish. The colonists were typically inattentive, uninterested, and bored during church services, according to the ministers, who complained that the people were sleeping, whispering, ogling the fashionably dressed women, walking about and coming and going, or at best looking out the windows or staring blankly into space. There were too few ministers for the widely scattered population, so ministers encouraged parishioners to become devout at home, using the Book of Common Prayer for private prayer and devotion (rather than the Bible). The stress on personal piety opened the way for the First Great Awakening, which pulled people away from the established church and into the unauthorized Baptist and Methodist movements.

New England
A group which later became known as the Pilgrims settled the Plymouth Colony in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1620, seeking refuge from persecution in Europe.
The Puritans, a much larger group than the Pilgrims, established the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629 with 400 settlers. Puritans were English Protestants who wished to reform and purify the Church of England in the New World of what they considered to be unacceptable residues of Catholicism. Within two years, an additional 2,000 settlers arrived. From 1620 to 1640 Puritans emigrated to New England from England to escape persecution and gain the liberty to worship as they chose independently of the Church of England, England being on the verge of the English Civil War. Most settled in New England, but some went as far as the West Indies. Theologically, the Puritans were ""non-separating Congregationalists."" The Puritans created a deeply religious, socially tight-knit and politically innovative culture that is still present in the modern United States. They hoped this new land would serve as a ""redeemer nation.""
Christianity's expansion had consequences for the indigenous people of the U.S. , dating back to King Philip's War, 1675–76. From the pulpits of New England's Puritan divines came ""an unvarying message"" of the ""evil native genius"" that needed to be dealt with.

Tolerance in Rhode Island and Pennsylvania
Roger Williams, who preached religious tolerance, separation of church and state, and a complete break with the Church of England, was banished from Massachusetts and founded Rhode Island Colony, which became a haven for other religious refugees from the Puritan community. Some migrants who came to Colonial America were in search of the freedom to practice forms of Christianity which were prohibited and persecuted in Europe. Since there was no state religion, and since Protestantism had no central authority, religious practice in the colonies became diverse.
The Quakers formed in England in 1652, where they were severely persecuted in England for daring to deviate so far from orthodox Anglican Christianity. Many sought refuge in New Jersey, Rhode Island and especially Pennsylvania, which was owned by William Penn, a rich Quaker. The Quakers kept political control until Indian wars broke out; the Quakers were pacifists and gave up control to groups that were eager to fight the Indians.
Beginning in 1683 many German-speaking immigrants arrived in Pennsylvania from the Rhine Valley and Switzerland. Starting in the 1730s Count Zinzendorf and the Moravian Brethren sought to minister to these immigrants while they also began missions among the Native American tribes of New York and Pennsylvania. Heinrich Melchior Muehlenberg organized the first Lutheran Synod in Pennsylvania in the 1740s.

Maryland
In the English colonies, Catholicism was introduced with the settling of Maryland. Catholic fortunes fluctuated in Maryland during the rest of the 17th century, as they became an increasingly smaller minority of the population. After the Glorious Revolution of 1689 in England, penal laws deprived Catholics of the right to vote, hold office, educate their children or worship publicly. Until the American Revolution, Catholics in Maryland, like Charles Carroll of Carrollton, were dissenters in their own country but keeping loyal to their convictions. At the time of the Revolution, Catholics formed less than 1% of the population of the thirteen colonies, in 2007, Catholics comprised 24% of US population.

Great Awakening
Evangelicalism is difficult to date and to define. Scholars have argued that, as a self-conscious movement, evangelicalism did not arise until the mid-17th century, perhaps not until the Great Awakening itself. The fundamental premise of evangelicalism is the conversion of individuals from a state of sin to a ""new birth"" through the preaching of the Word. The Great Awakening refers to a northeastern Protestant revival movement that took place in the 1730s and 1740s.
The first generation of New England Puritans required that church members undergo a conversion experience that they could describe publicly. Their successors were not as successful in reaping harvests of redeemed souls. The movement began with Jonathan Edwards, a Massachusetts preacher who sought to return to the Pilgrims' strict Calvinist roots. British preacher George Whitefield and other itinerant preachers continued the movement, traveling across the colonies and preaching in a dramatic and emotional style. Followers of Edwards and other preachers of similar religiosity called themselves the ""New Lights,"" as contrasted with the ""Old Lights,"" who disapproved of their movement. To promote their viewpoints, the two sides established academies and colleges, including Princeton and Williams College. The Great Awakening has been called the first truly American event.
The supporters of the Awakening and its evangelical thrust—Presbyterians, Baptists, and Methodists—became the largest American Protestant denominations by the first decades of the 19th century. By the 1770s, the Baptists were growing rapidly both in the north (where they founded Brown University), and in the South. Opponents of the Awakening or those split by it—Anglicans, Quakers, and Congregationalists—were left behind.
The First Great Awakening of the 1740s increased religiosity in most of the colonies. By 1780 the percentage of adult colonists who formally held membership in a church was between 10 and 30%. North Carolina had the lowest percentage at about 4%, while New Hampshire and South Carolina were tied for the highest, at about 16%. Many others informally associated with the churches.

American Revolution
The Revolution split some denominations, notably the Church of England, most of whose ministers supported the king. The Quakers and some German sects were pacifists and remained neutral. Religious practice suffered in certain places because of the absence of ministers and the destruction of churches, but in other areas, religion flourished.
Badly hurt, the Anglicans reorganized after the war. It became the Protestant Episcopal Church.
In 1794, the Russian Orthodox missionary St. Herman of Alaska arrived on Kodiak island in Alaska and began significantly evangelizing the native peoples. Nearly all Russians left in 1867 when the U.S. purchased Alaska, but the Eastern Orthodox faith remained.
Lambert (2003) has examined the religious affiliations and beliefs of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Of the 55 delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention, 49 were Protestants, and two were Catholics (D. Carroll, and Fitzsimons). Among the Protestant delegates to the Constitutional Convention, 28 were Church of England (or Episcopalian, after the American Revolutionary War was won), eight were Presbyterians, seven were Congregationalists, two were Lutherans, two were Dutch Reformed, and two were Methodists.

Church and state debate
After independence, the American states were obliged to write constitutions establishing how each would be governed. For three years, from 1778 to 1780, the political energies of Massachusetts were absorbed in drafting a charter of government that the voters would accept. One of the most contentious issues was whether the state would support the church financially. Advocating such a policy were the ministers and most members of the Congregational Church, which received public financial support, during the colonial period. The Baptists tenaciously adhered to their ancient conviction that churches should receive no support from the state. The Constitutional Convention chose to support the church and Article Three authorized a general religious tax to be directed to the church of a taxpayers' choice.
Such tax laws also took effect in Connecticut and New Hampshire.

19th century
Separation of church and state
In October 1801, members of the Danbury Baptists Associations wrote a letter to the new President-elect Thomas Jefferson. Baptists, being a minority in Connecticut, were still required to pay fees to support the Congregationalist majority. The Baptists found this intolerable. The Baptists, well aware of Jefferson's own unorthodox beliefs, sought him as an ally in making all religious expression a fundamental human right and not a matter of government largesse.
In his January 1, 1802, reply to the Danbury Baptist Association Jefferson summed up the First Amendment's original intent, and used for the first time anywhere a now-familiar phrase in today's political and judicial circles: the amendment, he wrote, established a ""wall of separation between church and state."" Largely unknown in its day, this phrase has since become a major Constitutional issue. The first time the U.S. Supreme Court cited that phrase from Jefferson was in 1878, 76 years later.

Second Great Awakening
The Second Great Awakening was a Protestant movement that began around 1790, gained momentum by 1800, and after 1820 membership rose rapidly among Baptist and Methodist congregations whose preachers led the movement. It was past its peak by the 1840s. It was a reaction against skepticism, deism, and rational Christianity, and was especially attractive to young women. Millions of new members enrolled in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations. Many converts believed that the Awakening heralded a new millennial age. The Second Great Awakening stimulated the establishment of many reform movements designed to remedy the evils of society before the anticipated Second Coming of Jesus Christ. The network of voluntary reform societies inspired by the Awakening was called the Benevolent Empire.
During the Second Great Awakening, new Protestant denominations emerged such as Adventists, churches in the Restoration Movement, and groups such as Jehovah's Witnesses and the Latter Day Saint movement. While the First Great Awakening was centered on reviving the spirituality of established congregations, the Second focused on the unchurched and sought to instill in them a deep sense of personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings.
The principal innovation produced by the revivals was the camp meeting. When assembled in a field or at the edge of a forest for a prolonged religious meeting, the participants transformed the site into a camp meeting. Singing and preaching were the main activities for several days. The revivals were often intense and created intense emotions. Some fell away but many if not most became permanent church members. The Methodists and Baptists made them one of the evangelical signatures of the denomination.

African American churches
The Christianity of the black population was grounded in evangelicalism. The Second Great Awakening has been called the ""central and defining event in the development of Afro-Christianity."" During these revivals Baptists and Methodists converted large numbers of blacks. However, many were disappointed at the treatment they received from their fellow believers and at the backsliding in the commitment to abolish slavery that many white Baptists and Methodists had advocated immediately after the American Revolution.
When their discontent could not be contained, forceful black leaders followed what was becoming an American habit—they formed new denominations. In 1787, Richard Allen and his colleagues in Philadelphia broke away from the Methodist Church and in 1815 founded the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church.
After the Civil War, Black Baptists desiring to practice Christianity away from racial discrimination, rapidly set up several separate state Baptist conventions. In 1866, black Baptists of the South and West combined to form the Consolidated American Baptist Convention. This convention eventually collapsed but three national conventions formed in response. In 1895 the three conventions merged to create the National Baptist Convention. It is now the largest African-American religious organization in the United States.

Liberal Christianity
The ""secularization of society"" is attributed to the time of the Enlightenment. In the United States, religious observance is much higher than in Europe, and the United States' culture leans conservative in comparison to other western nations, in part due to the Christian element.
Liberal Christianity, exemplified by some theologians, sought to bring to churches new critical approaches to the Bible. Sometimes called ""liberal theology"", liberal Christianity is an umbrella term covering movements and ideas within 19th- and 20th-century Christianity. New attitudes became evident, and the practice of questioning the nearly universally accepted Christian orthodoxy began to come to the forefront.
In the post–World War I era, liberalism was the faster-growing sector of the American church. Liberal wings of denominations were on the rise, and a considerable number of seminaries held and taught from a liberal perspective as well. In the post–World War II era, the trend began to swing back towards the conservative camp in America's seminaries and church structures.

Catholic Church
By 1850 Catholics had become the country's largest single denomination. Between 1860 and 1890 the population of Catholics in the United States tripled through immigration; by the end of the decade, it would reach seven million. These huge numbers of immigrant Catholics came from Ireland, Quebec, Southern Germany, Italy, Poland and Eastern Europe. This influx would eventually bring increased political power for the Catholic Church and a greater cultural presence led at the same time to a growing fear of the Catholic ""menace"". As the 19th century wore on, animosity waned; Protestant Americans realized that Catholics were not trying to seize control of the government.

Fundamentalism
Protestant fundamentalism began as a movement in the late 19th century and early 20th century to reject influences of secular humanism and source criticism in modern Christianity. In reaction to liberal Protestant groups that denied doctrines considered fundamental to these conservative groups, they sought to establish tenets necessary to maintaining a Christian identity, the ""fundamentals,"" hence the term fundamentalist.
Over time, the movement divided, with the label Fundamentalist being retained by the smaller and more hard-line group(s). Evangelical has become the main identifier of the groups holding to the movement's moderate and earliest ideas.

20th century
Evangelicalism
In the U.S. and elsewhere in the world, there has been a marked rise in the evangelical wing of Protestant denominations, especially those that are more exclusively evangelical, and a corresponding decline in the mainstream liberal churches.
The 1950s saw a boom in the Evangelical church in America. The post–World War II prosperity experienced in the U.S. also had its effects on the church. Church buildings were erected in large numbers, and the Evangelical church's activities grew along with this expansive physical growth. In the southern U.S., the Evangelicals, represented by leaders such as Billy Graham, have experienced a notable surge displacing the caricature of the pulpit pounding country preachers of fundamentalism. The stereotypes have gradually shifted.
Although the Evangelical community worldwide is diverse, the ties that bind all Evangelicals are still apparent: a ""high view"" of Scripture, belief in the Deity of Christ, the Trinity, salvation by grace through faith, and the bodily resurrection of Christ.

National associations
The Federal Council of Churches, founded in 1908, marked the first major expression of a growing modern ecumenical movement among Christians in the United States. It was active in pressing for reform of public and private policies, particularly as they impacted the lives of those living in poverty, and developed a comprehensive and widely debated Social Creed which served as a humanitarian ""bill of rights"" for those seeking improvements in American life.
In 1950, the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA (usually identified as National Council of Churches, or NCC) represented a dramatic expansion in the development of ecumenical cooperation. It was a merger of the Federal Council of Churches, the International Council of Religious Education, and several other interchurch ministries. Today, the NCC is a joint venture of 35 Christian denominations in the United States with 100,000 local congregations and 45,000,000 adherents. Its member communions include Mainline Protestant, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, African-American, Evangelical and historic Peace churches. The NCC took a prominent role in the Civil Rights Movement and fostered the publication of the widely used Revised Standard Version of the Bible, followed by an updated New Revised Standard Version, the first translation to benefit from the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The organization is headquartered in New York City, with a public policy office in Washington, DC. The NCC is related fraternally to hundreds of local and regional councils of churches, to other national councils across the globe, and to the World Council of Churches. All of these bodies are independently governed.
Carl McIntire led in organizing the American Council of Christian Churches (ACCC), now with 7 member bodies, in September 1941. It was a more militant and fundamentalist organization set up in opposition to what became the National Council of Churches.
The National Association of Evangelicals for United Action was formed in St. Louis, Missouri on April 7–9, 1942. It soon shortened its name to the National Association of Evangelicals (NEA). There are currently 60 denominations with about 45,000 churches in the organization. The NEA is related fraternally the World Evangelical Fellowship.
In 2006, 39 communions and 7 Christian organizations officially launched Christian Churches Together in the USA (CCT). CCT provides a space that is inclusive of the diversity of Christian traditions in the United States—Evangelical/Pentecostal, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Catholic, historic Protestant, and historic Black churches. CCT is characterized by its emphasis on relationships and prayer. Every year these communions and organizations meet over four days to discuss critical social issues, pray and strengthen their relationships.

Pentecostalism
Another noteworthy development in 20th-century Christianity was the rise of the modern Pentecostal movement. Pentecostalism, which had its roots in the Pietism and the Holiness movement, many will cite that it arose out of the meetings in 1906 at an urban mission on Azusa Street in Los Angeles, but it actually started in 1900 in Topeka, Kansas with a group led by Charles Parham and the Bethel Bible School. From there it spread by those who experienced what they believed to be miraculous moves of God there.
Pentecostalism would later birth the Charismatic movement within already established denominations, and it continues to be an important force in Western Christianity.

Catholic Church
By the beginning of the 20th century, approximately one-sixth of the population of the United States was Catholic. Modern Catholic immigrants come to the United States from the Philippines, Poland, and Latin America, especially from Mexico. This multiculturalism and diversity have greatly impacted the flavor of Catholicism in the United States. For example, many dioceses serve in both the English language and the Spanish language.

While children and youth in the colonial era were treated as small adults, awareness of their special status and needs grew in the nineteenth century, as one after another the denominations large and small began special programs for their young people. Protestant theologian Horace Bushnell in Christian Nurture (1847) emphasized the necessity of identifying and supporting the religiosity of children and young adults. Beginning in the 1790s the Protestant denominations set up Sunday school programs. They provided a major source of new members. Urban Protestant churchmen set up the interdenominational YMCA (and later the YWCA) programs in cities from the 1850s. Methodists looked on their youth as potential political activists, providing them with opportunities to engage in social justice movements such as prohibition. Black Protestants, especially after they could form their own separate churches, integrated their young people directly into the larger religious community. Their youth played a major role in the leadership of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and the 1960s. White evangelicals in the twentieth century set up Bible clubs for teenagers and experimented with the use of music to attract young people. The Catholics set up an entire network of parochial schools, and by the late nineteenth century probably more than half of their young members were attending elementary schools run by local parishes. Some Missouri Synod German Lutherans and Dutch Reformed churches also set up parochial schools. In the twentieth century, all the denominations sponsored programs such as the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.

Demographics
Demographics by state
Beliefs and attitudes
The Baylor University Institute for Studies of Religion conducted a survey covering various aspects of American religious life. The researchers analyzing the survey results have categorized the responses into what they call the ""four Gods"": An authoritarian God (31%), a benevolent God (25%), a distant God (23%), and a critical God (16%). A major implication to emerge from this survey is that ""the type of god people believe in can predict their political and moral attitudes more so than just looking at their religious tradition.""
As far as religious tradition, the survey determined that 33.6% of respondents are evangelical Protestants, while 10.8% had no religious affiliation at all. Out of those without affiliation, 62.9% still indicated that they ""believe in God or some higher power"".
Another study, conducted by Christianity Today with Leadership magazine, attempted to understand the range and differences among American Christians. A national attitudinal and behavioral survey found that their beliefs and practices clustered into five distinct segments. Spiritual growth for two large segments of Christians may be occurring in non-traditional ways. Instead of attending church on Sunday mornings, many opt for personal, individual ways to stretch themselves spiritually.

19 percent of American Christians are described by the researchers as Active Christians. They believe salvation comes through Jesus Christ, attend church regularly, are Bible readers, invest in personal faith development through their church, accept leadership positions in their church, and believe they are obligated to ""share [their] faith"", that is, to evangelize others.
20 percent are referred to as Professing Christians. They are also committed to ""accepting Christ as Savior and Lord"" as the key to being a Christian, but focus more on personal relationships with God and Jesus than on church, Bible reading or evangelizing.
16 percent fall into a category named Liturgical Christians. They are predominantly Lutheran, Catholic, Episcopalian, Eastern Orthodox or Oriental Orthodox. They are regular churchgoers, have a high level of spiritual activity and recognize the authority of the church.
24 percent are considered Private Christians. They own a Bible but do not tend to read it. Only about one-third attend church at all. They believe in God and in doing good things, but not necessarily within a church context. This was the largest and youngest segment. Almost none are church leaders.
21 percent in the research are called Cultural Christians. These do not view Jesus as essential to salvation. They exhibit little outward religious behavior or attitudes. They favor a universality theology that sees many ways to God. Yet, they clearly consider themselves to be Christians.

Church attendance
Gallup International indicates that 41% of American citizens report they regularly attend religious services, compared to 15% of French citizens, 10% of British citizens, and 7.5% of Australian citizens.
The Bible Belt is an informal term for a region in the Southern United States in which socially conservative evangelical Protestantism is a significant part of the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher than the nation's average. By contrast, religion plays the least important role in New England and in the Western United States.

By state
Church attendance varies significantly by state and region. In a 2014 Gallup survey, less than half of Americans said that they attended church or synagogue weekly. The figures ranged from 51% in Utah to 17% in Vermont.

U.S. territories
Below is the percent of population that are Christians in the U.S. territories in 2015.

Race
Data from the Pew Research Center show that as of 2008, the majority of White Americans were Christian, and about 51% of the White American were Protestant, and 26% were Catholic.
The most methodologically rigorous study of Hispanic and Latino Americans religious affiliation to date was the Hispanic Churches in American Public Life (HCAPL) National Survey, conducted between August and October 2000. This survey found that 70% of all Hispanic and Latino Americans are Catholic, 20% are Protestant, 3% are ""alternative Christians"" (such as Latter Day Saints or Jehovah's Witnesses). According to a Public Religion Research Institute study in 2017, the majority of Hispanic and Latino Americans are Christians (76%), and about 11% of Americans identify as Hispanic or Latino Christian.
The majority of African Americans are Protestant (78%), many of whom follow the historically black churches. A 2012 Pew Research Center study found that 42% of Asian Americans identify themselves as Christians.

Ethnicity
Beginning around 1600, Northern European settlers introduced Anglican and Puritan religion, as well as Baptist, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Quaker, and Moravian denominations.
Beginning in the 16th century, the Spanish (and later the French and English) introduced Catholicism. From the 19th century to the present, Catholics came to the US in large numbers due to the immigration of Irish, Germans, Italians, Hispanics, Portuguese, French, Polish, Hungarians, Lebanese (Maronite), and other ethnic groups.

Most of the Eastern Orthodox adherents in the United States are descended from immigrants of Eastern European or Middle Eastern background, especially from Greek, Russian, Ukrainian, Arab, Bulgarian, Romanian, or Serbian backgrounds. With a significant minority being Alaska Natives.
Most of the Oriental Orthodox adherents in the United States are from Armenian, Coptic-Egyptian and Ethiopian-Eritrean backgrounds.
Along with the Ethiopian-Eritrean Christians also came the P'ent'ay Evangelical Churches, a part of Evangelicalism that maintains the Eastern Christian Calendar and other cultural traditions. 
Most of the traditional Church of the East adherents in the United States are ethnically Assyrian.
Data from the Pew Research Center show that as of 2013, there were about 1.6 million Christians from Jewish background, most of them Protestant. According to the same data, most of the Christians of Jewish descent were raised as Jews or are Jews by ancestry.

Education
Conversion
A study from 2015 estimated some 450,000 American Muslims had converted to Christianity, most of whom belong to an evangelical or Pentecostal community. In 2010 there were approximately 180,000 Arab-Americans and about 130,000 Iranian Americans who converted from Islam to Christianity. Dudley Woodbury, a Fulbright scholar of Islam, estimates that 20,000 Muslims convert to Christianity annually in the United States. Many Druze immigrants to the United States converted to Protestantism, becoming communicants of the Presbyterian or Methodist Churches.
It's been also reported that conversion into Christianity is significantly increasing among Korean Americans, Chinese Americans, and Japanese Americans. By 2012, the percentage of Christians within the mentioned communities was 71%, more than 30% and 37%.
Messianic Judaism (or Messianic Movement) is the name of a Protestant movement comprising a number of streams, whose members may consider themselves Jewish. It blends elements of religious Jewish practice with evangelical Protestantism. Messianic Judaism affirms Christian creeds such as the messiahship and divinity of ""Yeshua"" (the Hebrew name of Jesus) and the Triune Nature of God, while also adhering to some Jewish dietary laws and customs. As of 2012, population estimates for the United States were between 175,000 and 250,000 members.
A 2013 Pew Research Center report found that 1.7 million American Jewish adults, 1.6 million of whom were raised in Jewish homes or had Jewish ancestry, identified as Christians or Messianic Jews but also consider themselves ethnically Jewish. According to a 2020 study by the Pew Research Center, 19% of those who say they were raised Jewish, consider themselves Christian.

History
Catholicism has had a significant cultural, social, and political impact on the United States.

Early colonial period
One of the Thirteen Colonies of British America, the Province of Maryland, ""a Catholic Proprietary"", was founded with an explicitly English Catholic identity in the 17th century, contrasting itself with neighboring the Protestant-dominated Massachusetts Bay Colony and Colony of Virginia. It was named after the Catholic Queen Henrietta Maria, the wife of Charles I of England. Politically, it was under the influence of Catholic colonial families of Maryland such as the Calvert Baron Baltimore and the Carroll family, the latter of Irish origin.
Much of the religious situation in the Thirteen Colonies reflected the sectarian divisions of the English Civil War. This predicament was especially precarious for Catholics. For this reason, Calvert wanted to provide ""a refuge for his fellow Catholics"" who were ""harassed in England by the Protestant majority.""  King Charles I, as a ""Catholic sympathizer"", favored and facilitated Calvert's plan if only to make evident that a ""policy of religious toleration could permit Catholics and Protestants to live together in harmony.""
The Province of Pennsylvania, which was given to Quaker William Penn by the last Catholic King of England, James II, advocated religious toleration as a principle and some Catholics lived there. There were also some Catholics in the Province of New York, named after King James II.
In 1785, the estimated number of Catholics was at 25,000; 15,800 in Maryland, 7,000 in Pennsylvania and 1,500 in New York. There were only 25 priests serving the faithful. This was less than 2% of the total population in the Thirteen Colonies.
In 1776, after the Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted and issued the United States Declaration of Independence and the Continental Army prevailed over the British in the American Revolutionary War, the United States came to incorporate into itself territories with a pre-existing Catholic history under their previous governance by New France and New Spain, the two premier European Catholic powers active in North America. The territorial evolution of the United States since 1776 has meant that today more areas that are now part of the United States were Catholic in colonial times before they were Protestant.

Founding of the United States
Anti-Catholicism was the policy for the English who first settled the New England colonies, and it persisted in the face of warfare with the French in New France, now part of Canada.  Maryland was founded by a Catholic, Lord Baltimore, as the first 'non-denominational' colony and was the first to accommodate Catholics. A charter was issued to him in 1632.
In 1650, the Puritans in the colony rebelled and repealed the Act of Toleration. Catholicism was outlawed and Catholic priests were hunted and exiled. By 1658, the Act of Toleration was reinstated and Maryland became the center of Catholicism into the mid-19th century. In 1689, Puritans rebelled and again repealed the Maryland Toleration Act. These rebels cooperated with the colonial assembly ""dominated by Anglicans to endow the Church of England with tax support and to bar Catholics (and Quakers) from holding public office."" New York proved more tolerant with its Catholic governor, Thomas Dongan, and other Catholic officials. Freedom of religion returned with the American Revolution.
In 1756, a Maryland Catholic official estimated seven thousand practicing Catholics in Maryland and three thousand in Pennsylvania. The Williamsburg Foundation estimates in 1765 Maryland Catholics at 20,000 and 6,000 in Pennsylvania. The population of these colonies at the time was approximately 180,000 and 200,000, respectively.  By the time the American War for Independence started in 1776, Catholics formed 1.6%, or 40,000 persons of the 2.5 million population of the 13 colonies. Another estimate is 35,000 in 1789, 60% in Maryland with not many more than 30 priests. John Carroll, first Catholic Bishop, in 1785, two years after the Treaty of Paris (1783), reported 24,000 registered communicants in the new country, of whom 90% were in Maryland and Pennsylvania.
After the Revolution, Rome made entirely new arrangements for the creation of an American diocese under American bishops. Numerous Catholics served in the American army and the new nation had very close ties with Catholic France. General George Washington insisted on toleration; for example, he issued strict orders in 1775 that ""Pope's Day"", the colonial equivalent of Guy Fawkes Night, was not to be celebrated. European Catholics played major military roles, especially Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau, Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing, Casimir Pulaski and Tadeusz Kościuszko. Irish-born Commodore John Barry from Co Wexford, Ireland, often credited as ""the Father of the American Navy"", also played an important military role. In a letter to Bishop Carroll, Washington acknowledged this unique contribution of French Catholics as well as the patriotic contribution of Carroll himself: ""And I promise that your fellow-citizens will not forget the patriotic part which you took in the accomplishments of their Revolution, and the establishment of their government; nor the important assistance which they received from a nation in which the Roman Catholic religion is professed.""
Beginning in approximately 1780 there was a struggle between lay trustees and bishops over the ownership of church property, with the trustees losing control following the 1852 Plenary Councils of Baltimore.
Historian Jay Dolan, writing on the colonial era in 2011, said:

They had lived as second-class citizens, discriminated against politically, professionally, and socially. The revolution changed all this. New laws and new constitutions gave them religious freedom.... [leading] John Carroll to observe in 1779 that Roman Catholics are members of Congress, assemblies, and hold civil and military posts.
President Washington promoted religious tolerance by proclamations and by publicly attending services in various Protestant and Catholic churches.  The old colonial laws imposing restrictions on Catholics were gradually abolished by the states, and were prohibited in the new federal constitution.
In 1787, two Catholics, Daniel Carroll of the Irish O'Carrolls and Irish born Thomas Fitzsimons, helped draft the new United States Constitution. John Carroll was appointed by the Vatican as Prefect Apostolic, making him superior of the missionary church in the thirteen states. He formulated the first plans for Georgetown University and became the first American bishop in 1789.

19th century
In 1803, the Louisiana Purchase saw vast territories in French Louisiana transferred over from the First French Republic, areas that would become the following states; Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Minnesota, Louisiana, South Dakota, Wyoming and Montana, half of Colorado, parts of New Mexico, Texas, and North Dakota. The French named a number of their settlements after Catholic saints, such as St. Louis, Sault Ste. Marie, St. Ignace, St. Charles and others. The Catholic, culturally French population of Americans, descended from this colony are today known as the Louisiana Creole and Cajun people.
During the 19th century, territories previously belonging to the Catholic Spanish Empire became part of the United States, starting with Florida in the 1820s. Most of the Spanish American territories with a Catholic heritage became independent during the early 19th century, this included Mexico on the border of the United States. The United States subsequently annexed parts of Mexico, starting with Texas in the 1840s and after the end of the Mexican–American War an area known as the Mexican Cession, including what would become the states of California, Nevada, Utah, most of Arizona, the rest of New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming. To an even greater extent than the French, the Spanish had named many settlements in the colonial period after Catholic saints or in reference to Catholic religious symbolism, names that they would retain after becoming part of the United States, especially in California (Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Sacramento, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara, Santa Monica, Santa Clarita, San Juan Capistrano, San Luis Obispo and numerous others), as well as Texas (San Antonio, San Juan, San Marcos and San Angelo), New Mexico (Santa Fe) and Florida (St. Augustine). In 1898, following the Spanish–American War, the United States took control of Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines, and Cuba for a time, all of which had several centuries of Spanish Catholic colonial history, though they were not made into states.
The number of Catholics surged starting in the 1840s as German, Irish, and other European Catholics came in large numbers. After 1890, Italians and Poles formed the largest numbers of new Catholics, but many countries in Europe contributed, as did Quebec. By 1850, Catholics had become the country's largest single denomination. Between 1860 and 1890, their population tripled to seven million.

Catholic revival
Historian John McGreevy identifies a major Catholic revival  that swept across Europe, North America, and South America in the early 19th century. It was nurtured in the world of Catholic urban neighborhoods, parishes, schools, and associations, whose members understood themselves as arrayed against, and morally superior to  the wider American society. The Catholic Revival is called ""Ultramontanism"".  It included a new emphasis on Thomistic theology for intellectuals. For parishioners it meant a much deeper piety that emphasized miracles, saints, and new devotions such as, compulsory Sunday attendance, regular confession and communion, praying the rosary,  a devotion to the Blessed Virgin, and  meatless Fridays.  There was a deeper respect for bishops, and especially the Pope, with more direct control by the Vatican over selecting bishops and less autonomy for local parishes.  There was a sharp increase in Mass attendance, religious vocations soared, especially among women. Catholics set up a parochial school system using the newly available nuns, and funding from the more religious parents. Intermarriage with Protestants was strongly discouraged. It was tolerated only if the children were brought up Catholics. The parochial schools  effectively promoted marriage inside the faith. By the late 19th century dioceses were building foreign language elementary schools in parishes that catered to Germans and other non-English speaking groups. They raised large sums to build English-only diocesan high schools, which had the effect of increasing ethnic intermarriage and diluting ethnic nationalism.  Leadership was increasingly in the hands of the Irish. The Irish bishops worked closely with the Vatican and promoted Vatican supremacy that culminated in Papal infallibility proclaimed in 1870.
The bishops began standardizing discipline in the American Church with the convocation of the Plenary Councils of Baltimore in 1852, 1866 and 1884. These councils resulted in the promulgation of the Baltimore Catechism and the establishment of the Catholic University of America.
Jesuit priests who had been expelled from Europe found a new base in the U.S. They founded numerous secondary schools and 28 colleges and universities, including Georgetown University (1789), St. Louis University (1818), Boston College, the College of Holy Cross, the University of Santa Clara, and several Loyola Colleges. Many other religious communities like the Dominicans, Congregation of Holy Cross, and Franciscans followed suit.
In the 1890s, the Americanism controversy roiled senior officials. The Vatican suspected there was too much liberalism in the American Church, and the result was a turn to conservative theology as the Irish bishops increasingly demonstrated their total loyalty to the Pope, and traces of liberal thought in the Catholic colleges were suppressed. As part of this controversy, the founder of the Paulist Fathers, Isaac Hecker, was accused by the French cleric Charles Maignen (in French) of subjectivism and crypto-Protestantism. Additionally some who sympathized with Hecker in France were accused of Americanism.

Nuns and sisters
Nuns and sisters played a major role in American religion, education, nursing and social work since the early 19th century. In Catholic Europe, convents were heavily endowed over the centuries, and were sponsored by the aristocracy. But there were very few rich American Catholics, and no aristocrats. Religious orders were founded by entrepreneurial women who saw a need and an opportunity, and were staffed by devout women from poor families. The numbers grew rapidly, from 900 sisters in 15 communities in 1840, 50,000 in 170 congregations in 1900, and 135,000 in 300 different congregations by 1930. Starting in 1820, the sisters always outnumbered the priests and brothers. Their numbers peaked in 1965 at 180,000 then plunged to 56,000 in 2010. Many women left their orders, and few new members were added.
On April 8, 2008, Cardinal William Levada, prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith under Pope Benedict XVI, met with the Leadership Conference of Women Religious leaders in Rome and communicated that the CDF would conduct a doctrinal assessment of the LCWR, expressing concern that the nuns were expressing radical feminist views. According to Laurie Goodstein, the investigation, which was viewed by many U.S. Catholics as a ""vexing and unjust inquisition of the sisters who ran the church's schools, hospitals and charities"", was ultimately closed in 2015 by Pope Francis.

Anti-Catholicism
Some anti-Catholic political movements appeared: the Know Nothings in the 1840s. American Protective Association in the 1890s, and the second Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s, were active in the United States. But even as early as 1884, in the face of outbreaks of anti-Catholicism, Catholic leaders like James Cardinal Gibbons were filled with admiration for their country: ""The oftener I go to Europe,"" Gibbons said, ""the longer I remain there, and the more I study the political condition of its people, I return home filled with greater admiration for our own country and [am] more profoundly grateful that I am an American citizen."" Animosity by Protestants waned as Catholics demonstrated their patriotism in World War I, their commitment to charity, and their dedication to democratic values.

20th–21st centuries
In the era of intense emigration from the 1840s to 1914, bishops often set up separate parishes for major ethnic groups, from Ireland, Germany, Poland, French Canada and Italy. In Iowa, the development of the Archdiocese of Dubuque, the work of Bishop Loras and the building of St. Raphael's Cathedral, to meet the needs of Germans and Irish, is illustrative. Noteworthy, too, was the contribution of 400 Italian Jesuit expatriates who, between 1848 and 1919, planted dozens of institutions to serve the diverse population out West. By century's end, they had founded colleges (later to become universities) in San Francisco, Santa Clara, Denver, Seattle and Spokane to meet the cultural and religious needs of people of that region. They also ministered to miners in Colorado, to Native Peoples in several states, and to Hispanics in New Mexico, ""building churches [in the latter state], publishing books and newspapers, and running schools in both the public and private sectors.""
By the beginning of the 20th century, approximately one-sixth of the population of the United States was Catholic. Modern Catholic immigrants come to the United States from the Philippines, Poland and Latin America, especially Mexico and Central America. This multiculturalism and diversity has influenced the conduct of Catholicism in the United States. For example, most dioceses offer Mass in a number of languages, and an increasing number of parishes offer Masses in the official language of the church, Latin, due to its universal nature.
Sociologist Andrew Greeley, an ordained Catholic priest at the University of Chicago, undertook a series of national surveys of Catholics in the late 20th century.  He published hundreds of books and articles, both technical and popular.  His biographer summarizes his interpretation:

He argued for the continued salience of ethnicity in American life and the distinctiveness of the Catholic religious imagination. Catholics differed from other Americans, he explained in a variety of publications, by their tendency to think in ""sacramental"" terms, imagining God as present in a world that was revelatory rather than bleak. The poetic elements in the Catholic tradition—its stories, imagery, and rituals—kept most Catholics in the fold, according to Greeley, whatever their disagreements with particular aspects of church discipline or doctrine. Despite the unchanging nature of church doctrine, Greeley insisted that Humanae Vitae, the 1968 papal encyclical upholding the Catholic ban on contraception is solely responsible for the sharp decline in weekly Mass attendance between 1968 and 1975.
In 1965, 71% of Catholics attended Mass regularly.
In the later 20th century ""[...] the Catholic Church in the United States became the subject of controversy due to allegations of clerical child abuse of children and adolescents, of episcopal negligence in arresting these crimes, and of numerous civil suits that cost Catholic dioceses hundreds of millions of dollars in damages."" Because of this, higher scrutiny and governance as well as protective policies and diocesan investigation into seminaries have been enacted to correct these former abuses of power, and safeguard parishioners and the church from further abuses and scandals.
One initiative is the ""National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management"" (NLRCM), a lay-led group born in the wake of the sexual abuse scandal and dedicated to bringing better administrative practices to 194 dioceses that include 19,000 parishes nationwide with some 35,000 lay ecclesial ministers who log 20 hours or more a week in these parishes.According to a 2015 study by Pew Researchers, 39% of Catholics attend church at least once a week and 40%, once or twice a month.
Although the issue of trusteeism was mostly settled in the 19th century, there have been some related issues. In 2005, an interdict was issued to board members of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church (St. Louis, Missouri) in an attempt to get them to turn over the church property to the Archdiocese of St. Louis. In 2006, a priest was accused of stealing $1.4 million from his parish, prompting a debate over Connecticut Raised Bill 1098 as a means of forcing the Catholic church to manage money differently. Related to issues of asset ownership, some parishes have been liquidated and the assets taken by the diocese instead of being distributed to nearby parishes, which in violation of church financial rules.
In 2009, John Micklethwait, editor of The Economist and co-author of God Is Back: How the Global Revival of Faith Is Changing the World, said that American Catholicism, which he describes in his book as ""arguably the most striking Evangelical success story of the second half of the nineteenth century,"" has competed quite happily ""without losing any of its basic characteristics."" It has thrived in America's ""pluralism"".
In 2011, an estimated 26 million American Catholics were ""fallen-away"", that is, not practicing their faith. Some religious commentators commonly refer to them as ""the second largest religious denomination in the United States."" Recent Pew Research survey results in 2014 show about 31.7% of American adults were raised Catholic, while 41% from among that group no longer identify as Catholic.
In a 2015 survey by researchers at Georgetown University, Americans who self identify as Catholic, including those who do not attend Mass regularly, numbered 81.6 million or 25% of the population, and 68.1 million or 20% of the American population are Catholics tied to a specific parish. About 25% of US Catholics say they attend Masses once a week or more, and about 38% went at least once a month. The study found that the number of US Catholics has increased by 3 to 6% each decade since 1965, and that the Catholic Church is ""the most diverse in terms of race and ethnicity in the US,"" with Hispanics accounting for 38% of Catholics and blacks and Asians 3% each. The Catholic Church in the US ""represents perhaps the most multi-ethnic organization of any kind, and so is a major laboratory for cross-cultural cooperation and cross-cultural communication completely within the nation's borders."" It is as if it wishes to forge a broader ecclesial identity to give newcomers a more inclusive welcome, similar to the aspirations of 19th century church leaders like Archbishops John Ireland and James Gibbons who ""wanted Catholic immigrants to become fully American, rather than 'strangers in a strange land.' "" Only 2 percent of American Catholics go to confession on a regular basis, while three-quarters of them go to confession once a year or less often; a valid confession is required by the Church after committing mortal sin to return to the State of Grace, necessary to receive Holy Communion. As one of the precepts of the church, it is also required that every Catholic makes a valid confession at least once a year.
According to Matthew Bunsen's analysis of a Real Clear poll of American Catholics in late 2019:

Catholicism has been battered by the winds of secularism, materialism, and relativism. Failures in catechesis and formation have created wide gaps in practice and belief that stretch now into every aspect of Catholic life.
Since 1970, weekly church attendance among Catholics has dropped from 55% to 20%, the number of priests declined from 59,000 to 35,000 and the number of people who have left Catholicism has increased from under 2 million in 1975 to over 30 million today.  In 2022, there were fewer than 42,000 nuns left in the United States, a 76% decline over 50 years, with fewer than 1% of nuns under age 40.
The RealClear poll data indicates that the Latino element has now reached 37 percent of the Catholic population, and growing. It is 60 percent Democratic, while the non-Latinos are split about 50-50 politically. Although many Americans still identify as Catholics, their religious participation rates are declining.  Today only 39% of all Catholics go to Mass at least weekly.  Nearly two-thirds of Catholics say that their trust in the church leadership has been undermined by the clergy sex abuse crisis.  Nevertheless, 86% of all Catholics still consider religion important in their own lives.

Organization
Catholics gather as local communities called parishes, headed by a priest, and typically meet at a permanent church building for liturgies every Sunday, weekdays and on holy days. Within the 196 geographical dioceses and archdioceses (excluding the Archdiocese for the Military Services), there were 17,007 local Catholic parishes in the United States in 2018. The Catholic Church has the third highest total number of local congregations in the US behind Southern Baptists and United Methodists. However, the average Catholic parish is significantly larger than the average Baptist or Methodist congregation; there are more than four times as many Catholics as Southern Baptists and more than eight times as many Catholics as United Methodists.
In the United States, there are 197 ecclesiastical jurisdictions:

177 Latin Church dioceses
including 32 Latin Catholic archdioceses
18 Eastern Catholic eparchies
including 2 Eastern Catholic archeparchies
including 1 Eparchy (for the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church)
2 ordinariates
one personal ordinariate for former Anglicans who came into full Catholic communion
one for members of the military (though equivalent to an archdiocese, it is technically a military ordinariate)
Eastern Catholic Churches are churches with origins in Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa that have their own distinctive liturgical, legal and organizational systems and are identified by the national or ethnic character of their region of origin. Each is considered fully equal to the Latin tradition within the Catholic Church. In the United States, there are 15 Eastern Church dioceses (called eparchies) and two Eastern Church archdioceses (or archeparchies), the Byzantine Catholic Archeparchy of Pittsburgh and the Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Philadelphia.
The apostolic exarchate for the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church in the United States is headed by a bishop who is a member of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. An apostolic exarchate is the Eastern Catholic Church equivalent of an apostolic vicariate. It is not a full-fledged diocese/eparchy, but is established by the Holy See for the pastoral care of Eastern Catholics in an area outside the territory of the Eastern Catholic Church to which they belong. It is headed by a bishop or a priest with the title of exarch.
The Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter was established January 1, 2012, to serve former Anglican groups and clergy in the United States who sought to become Catholic. Similar to a diocese though national in scope, the ordinariate is based in Houston, Texas, and includes parishes and communities across the United States that are fully Catholic, while retaining elements of their Anglican heritage and traditions.
As of 2024, 8 dioceses out of 196 are vacant (sede vacante).
The central leadership body of the Catholic Church in the United States is the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, made up of the hierarchy of bishops (including archbishops) of the United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands, although each bishop is independent in his own diocese, answerable only to the Holy See. The USCCB elects a president to serve as their administrative head, but he is in no way the ""head"" of the church or of Catholics in the United States. In addition to the 195 dioceses and one exarchate represented in the USCCB, there are several dioceses in the nation's other four overseas dependencies. In the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the bishops in the six dioceses (one metropolitan archdiocese and five suffragan dioceses) form their own episcopal conference, the Puerto Rican Episcopal Conference (Conferencia Episcopal Puertorriqueña). The bishops in US insular areas in the Pacific Ocean—the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Territory of American Samoa, and the Territory of Guam—are members of the Episcopal Conference of the Pacific.
No primate exists for Catholics in the United States. In the 1850s, the Archdiocese of Baltimore was acknowledged a Prerogative of Place, which confers to its archbishop some of the leadership responsibilities granted to primates in other countries. The Archdiocese of Baltimore was the first diocese established in the United States, in 1789, with John Carroll (1735–1815) as its first bishop. It was, for many years, the most influential diocese in the fledgling nation. Now, however, the United States has several large archdioceses and a number of cardinal-archbishops.
By far, most Catholics in the United States belong to the Latin Church of the Catholic Church. Rite generally refers to the form of worship (""liturgical rite"") in a church community owing to cultural and historical differences as well as differences in practice. However, the Vatican II document, Orientalium Ecclesiarum (""Of the Eastern Churches""), acknowledges that these Eastern Catholic communities are ""true Churches"" and not just rites within the Catholic Church. There are 14 other churches in the United States (23 within the global Catholic Church) which are in communion with Rome, fully recognized and valid in the eyes of the Catholic Church. They have their own bishops and eparchies. The largest of these communities in the U.S. is the Chaldean Catholic Church. Most of these churches are of Eastern European and Middle Eastern origin. Eastern Catholic Churches are distinguished from Eastern Orthodox, identifiable by their usage of the term Catholic.
In recent years, particularly following the issuing of the apostolic letter Summorum Pontificum by Pope Benedict XVI in 2007, the United States has emerged as a stronghold for the small but growing Traditionalist Catholic movement, along with France, England and a few other Anglophone countries. There are over 600 locations throughout the country where the Traditional Latin Mass is offered.

Personnel
The church employs people in a variety of leadership and service roles. Its ministers include ordained clergy (bishops, priests, and deacons) and non-ordained lay ecclesial ministers, theologians, and catechists.
Some Catholics, both lay and clergy, live in a form of consecrated life, rather than in marriage. This includes a wide range of relationships, from monastic (monks and nuns), to mendicant (friars and sisters), apostolic (priests, brothers, and sisters), and secular and lay institutes. While many of these also serve in some form of ministry, above, others are in secular careers, within or without the church. Consecrated life – in and of itself – does not make a person a part of the clergy or a minister of the church.
Additionally, many lay people are employed in ""secular"" careers in support of church institutions, including educators, health care professionals, finance and human resources experts, lawyers, and others.

Bishops
Leadership of the Catholic Church in the United States is provided by the bishops, individually for their own dioceses and collectively through the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. There are some mid-level groupings of bishops, such as ecclesiastical provinces (often covering a state) and the fourteen geographic regions of the USCCB, but these have little significance for most purposes.
The ordinary office for a bishop is to be the bishop of a particular diocese, its chief pastor and minister, usually geographically defined and incorporating, on average, about 350,000 Catholic Christians. In canon law, the bishop leading a particular diocese, or similar office, is called an ""ordinary"" (i.e., he has complete jurisdiction in this territory or grouping of Christians).
There are two non-geographic dioceses, called ""ordinariates"", one for military personnel and one for former Anglicans who are in full communion with the Catholic Church.
Dioceses are grouped together geographically into provinces, usually within a state, part of a state, or multiple states together (see map below). A province comprises several dioceses which look to one ordinary bishop (usually of the most populous or historically influential diocese/city) for guidance and leadership. This lead bishop is their archbishop and his diocese is the archdiocese. The archbishop is called the ""metropolitan"" bishop who strives to achieve some unanimity of practice with his brother ""suffragan"" bishops.
Some larger dioceses have additional bishops assisting the diocesan bishop, and these are called ""auxiliary"" bishops or, if a ""coadjutor"" bishop, with right of succession.
Additionally, some bishops are called to advise and assist the bishop of Rome, the pope, in a particular way, either as an additional responsibility on top of their diocesan office or sometimes as a full-time position in the Roman Curia or related institution serving the universal church. These are called cardinals, because they are ""incardinated"" onto a second diocese (Rome). All cardinals under the age of 80 participate in the election of a new pope when the office of the papacy becomes vacant.
There are 428 active and retired Catholic bishops in the United States:

255 active bishops:

36 archbishops
144 diocesan bishops
67 auxiliary bishops
8 apostolic or diocesan administrators
173 retired bishops:

33 retired archbishops
95 retired diocesan bishops
45 retired auxiliary bishops

Cardinals
There are 17 U.S. cardinals.
Four archdioceses are currently led by archbishops who have been created cardinals:

Blase J. Cupich – Chicago
Timothy M. Dolan – New York
Robert W. McElroy – Washington, D.C.
Joseph W. Tobin – Newark
Three cardinals are in service to the pope, in the Roman Curia or related offices:

Kevin Farrell – Prefect of the Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life
James Michael Harvey – Archpriest of the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls
Robert Francis Prevost – Prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops
Ten cardinals are retired:

Raymond Leo Burke – patron emeritus of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and Prefect Emeritus of the Apostolic Signatura
Daniel DiNardo – Archbishop Emeritus of Galveston-Houston
Wilton Daniel Gregory – Archbishop Emeritus of Washington, D.C.
Roger Mahony – Archbishop Emeritus of Los Angeles
Adam Maida – Archbishop Emeritus of Detroit
Edwin Frederick O'Brien – Grand Master Emeritus of the Equestrian Order of the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem
Seán Patrick O'Malley – Archbishop Emeritus of Boston
Justin Francis Rigali – Archbishop Emeritus of Philadelphia
James Stafford – Major Penitentiary Emeritus of the Apostolic Penitentiary and Archbishop Emeritus of Denver
Donald Wuerl – Archbishop Emeritus of Washington, D.C.

Clergy and ministers
In 2018, there were approximately 100,000 clergy and ministers employed by the church in the United States, including:

36,580 presbyters (priests)
25,254 diocesan
11,326 religious/consecrated
18,291 ordinary (permanent) deacons
39,651 lay ecclesial ministers (2016)
23,149 diocesan
16,502 religious/consecrated
There are also approximately 30,000 seminarians/students in formation for ministry:

3,526 candidates for priesthood
2,088 candidates for diaconate
16,585 candidates for lay ecclesial ministry

Lay employees
The 630 Catholic hospitals in the U.S. have a combined budget of $101.7 billion, and employ 641,030 full-time equivalent staff.
The 6,525 Catholic primary and secondary schools in the U.S. employ 151,101 full-time equivalent staff, 97.2% of whom are lay and 2.3% are consecrated, and 0.5% are ordained.
The 261 Catholic institutions of higher (tertiary) education in the U.S. employ approximately 250,000 full-time equivalent staff, including faculty, administrators, and support staff.
Overall, the Catholic Church employs more than one million employees with an operating budget of nearly $100 billion to run parishes, diocesan primary and secondary schools, nursing homes, retreat centers, hospitals, and other charitable institutions.

Institutions
Parochial schools
By the middle of the 19th century, the Catholics in larger cities started building their own parochial school system. The main impetus was fear that exposure to Protestant teachers in the public schools, and Protestant fellow students, would lead to a loss of faith. Protestants reacted by strong opposition to any public funding of parochial schools. The Catholics nevertheless built their elementary schools, parish by parish, using very low-paid sisters as teachers.
In the classrooms, the highest priorities were piety, orthodoxy, and strict discipline. Knowledge of the subject matter was a minor concern, and in the late 19th century few of the teachers in parochial (or secular) schools had gone beyond the 8th grade themselves. The sisters came from numerous denominations, and there was no effort to provide joint teachers training programs. The bishops were indifferent. Finally around 1911, led by the Catholic University of America in Washington, Catholic colleges began summer institutes to train the sisters in pedagogical techniques. Long past World War II, the Catholic schools were noted for inferior plants compared to the public schools, and less well-trained teachers. The teachers were selected for religiosity, not teaching skills; the outcome was pious children and a reduced risk of marriage to Protestants. However, by the later half the 20th century Catholic schools began to perform significantly better than their public counterparts. In 2024, the National Catholic Educational Association reported that 99% of the students in 1,174 Catholic secondary schools graduated on time and 85% of them went on to four-year colleges.

Universities and colleges
According to the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities in 2011, there are approximately 230 Catholic universities and colleges in the United States with nearly 1 million students and some 65,000 professors. In 2016, the number of tertiary schools fell to 227, while the number of students also fell to 798,006. The national university of the church, founded by the nation's bishops in 1887, is The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. The first Catholic college/university of higher learning established in the United States is Georgetown University, founded in 1789. The richest U.S. Catholic university is the University of Notre Dame (founded in 1842) with an endowment of over 20 billion in 2022. In the 2025 edition of U.S. News & World Report rankings, 9 of the top 100 national universities and 6 of the top national liberal arts colleges in the US were Catholic.

Seminaries
According to the 2016 Official Catholic Directory, as of 2016 there were 243 seminaries with 4,785 students in the United States; 3,629 diocesan seminarians and 1,456 religious seminarians. By the official 2017 statistics, there are 5,050 seminarians (3,694 diocesan and 1,356 religious) in the United States. In addition, the American Catholic bishops oversee the Pontifical North American College for American seminarians and priests studying at one of the Pontifical Universities in Rome.

Healthcare system
In 2002, Catholic health care system, overseeing 625 hospitals with a combined revenue of 30 billion dollars, was the nation's largest group of nonprofit systems. In 2008, the cost of running these hospitals had risen to $84.6 billion, including the $5.7 billion they donate. According to the Catholic Health Association of the United States, 60 health care systems, on average, admit one in six patients nationwide each year. According to Merger Watch (2018), Catholic facilities make up about 10% of all ""sole community providers"" in the US (49 out of 514). In some states, the percentage is much greater: in Wisconsin and South Dakota, for example, ""Catholic hospitals account for at least 50% of sole community providers.""

Catholic Charities
Catholic Charities is active as the largest voluntary social service networks in the United States. In 2009, it welcomed in New Jersey the 50,000th refugee to come to the United States from Burma. Likewise, the US Bishops' Migration and Refugee Services has resettled 14,846 refugees from Burma since 2006. In 2010 Catholic Charities USA was one of only four charities among the top 400 charitable organizations to witness an increase in donations in 2009, according to a survey conducted by The Chronicle of Philanthropy.

Demographics
The number of Catholics grew rapidly in the 19th and 20th centuries through high fertility and immigration, especially from Ireland and Germany, and after 1880, Eastern Europe, Italy, and Quebec. Large scale Catholic immigration from Mexico began after 1910, and in 2019 Latinos comprised 37 percent of American Catholics.
Since 1960, the percentage of Americans who are Catholic has fallen from about 25% to 22%. In a 2021 Pew Research study, ""21% of US adults described themselves as Catholic, identical to the Catholic share of the population in 2014."" In absolute numbers, Catholics have increased from 45 million to 72 million. As of April 9, 2018, 39% of American Catholics attend church weekly, compared to 45% of American Protestants.
About 10% of the United States' population as of 2010 are former Catholics or non-practicing, almost 30 million people. People have left for a number of reasons, factors which have also affected other denominations: loss of belief, disenchantment, indifference, or disaffiliation for another religious group or for none. Though Catholic adherents are present throughout the country, Catholics are generally more concentrated in the Northeast and urban Midwest. Currently, however, they are also clustered in the southwest. This is because of the continuing growth of the American Hispanic community as a share of the U.S. population is gradually shifting the geographic center of U.S. Catholicism from the Northeast and urban Midwest to the South and the West. Regional distribution of U.S. Catholics (as a percentage of the total U.S. Catholic population) is as follows: Northeast, 24%; Midwest, 19%; South, 32% (a percentage that has increased in recent years due to a growing number of Catholics mainly in Texas, Louisiana, and Florida, with the rest of the Southern states remaining overwhelmingly Protestant); and West, 25%. While the wealthiest and most educated Americans tend to belong to some Protestant American groupings as well as to Jewish and Hindu constituencies as a whole, more Catholics (13.3 million ), owing to their sheer numbers, reside in households with a yearly income of $100,000-or-more than any other individual religious group, and more Catholics hold college degrees (over 19 million) than do members of any other faith community in the United States when divided according to their respective denominations or religious designations.
There were 70,412,000 registered Catholics in the United States (22% of the US population) in 2017, according to the American bishops' count in their Official Catholic Directory 2016. This count primarily rests on the parish assessment tax which priests evaluate yearly according to the number of registered members and contributors. In July 2021, the Public Religion Research Institute issued its own report based on a new census of 500,000 people. It also noted that 22% of 330 million Americans identified as Catholic: 12%, white; 8%, Latino; and 2%, other (Black, Asian, etc.). Estimates of the overall American Catholic population from recent years generally range around 20% to 28%. According to Albert J. Menedez, research director of ""Americans for Religious Liberty"", many Americans continue to call themselves Catholic but ""do not register at local parishes for a variety of reasons."" According to a survey of 35,556 American residents (released in 2008 by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life), 23.9% of Americans identify themselves as Catholic (approximately 72 million of a national population of 306 million residents). The study notes that 10% of those people who identify themselves as Protestant in the interview are former Catholics and 8% of those who identity themselves as Catholic are former Protestants. In recent years, more parishes have opened than closed.
The northeastern quadrant of the US (i.e., New England, Mid-Atlantic, East North Central, and West North Central) has seen a decline in the number of parishes since 1970, but parish numbers are up in the other five regions (i.e., South Atlantic, East South Central, West South Central, Pacific, and Mountain regions) and are growing steadily. Catholics in the US are about 6% of the church's total worldwide 1.3 billion membership.

A poll by The Barna Group in 2004 found Catholic ethnicity to be 60% non-Hispanic white (includes Americans with historically Catholic ethnicities such as Irish, Italian, German, Polish, or French), 31% Hispanic of any nationality (mostly Mexicans but also many Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Salvadorans, Colombians, Guatemalans and Hondurans among others), 4% Black (including Africans, Haitians, black Latino and Caribbean), and 5% other ethnicity (mostly Filipinos, Vietnamese and other Asian Americans, Americans who are multiracial and have mixed ethnicities, and American Indians). Among the non-Hispanic whites, about 16 million Catholics identify as being of Irish descent, about 13 million as German, about 12 million as Italian, about 7 million as Polish, and about 5 million as French (note that many identify with more than one ethnicity). The roughly 7.8 million Catholics who are converts (mainly from Protestantism, with a smaller number from irreligion or other religions) are also mostly non-Hispanic white, including many people of British, Dutch, and Scandinavian ancestry.
Between 1990 and 2008, there were 11 million additional Catholics. The growth in the Latino population accounted for 9 million of these. They accounted for 32% of all American Catholics in 2008 as opposed to 20% in 1990. The percentage of Hispanics who identified as Catholic dropped from 67% in 2010 to 55% in 2013.
According to a more recent Pew Forum report which examined American religiosity in 2014 and compared it to 2007, there were 50.9 million adult Catholics as of 2014 (excluding children under 18), forming about 20.8% of the U.S. population, down from 54.3 million and 23.9% in 2007. Pew also found that the Catholic population is aging, forming a higher percentage of the elderly population than the young, and retention rates are also worse among the young. About 41% of those ""young"" raised Catholic have left the faith (as opposed to 32% overall), about half of these to the unaffiliated population and the rest to evangelical, other Protestant faith communities, and non-Christian faith. Conversions to Catholicism are rare, with 89% of current Catholics being raised in the religion; 8% of current Catholics are ex-Protestants, 2% were raised unaffiliated, and 1% in other religions (Orthodox Christian, Mormon or other nontrinitarian, Buddhist, Muslim, etc.), with Jews and Hindus least likely to become Catholic of all the religious groups surveyed. Overall, Catholicism has by far the worst net conversion balance of any major religious group, with a high conversion rate out of the faith and a low rate into it; by contrast, most other religions have in- and out-conversion rates that roughly balance, whether high or low. According to the 2015 Pew Research Center, ""the Catholic share of the population has been relatively stable over the long term, according to a variety of other surveys. By race, 59% of Catholics are non-Hispanic white, 34% Hispanic, 3% black, 3% Asian, and 2% mixed or Native American. Conversely, 19% of non-Hispanic whites were Catholic in 2014 (down from 22% in 2007), whereas 55% of Hispanics were (versus 58% in 2007). In 2015, Hispanics were 38%, while blacks and Asians were at 3% each. Because conversion away from Catholicism as well as dropping out of religion completely is presently occurring much more quickly among Hispanics than among Euro-American whites, Black (2.9% of US Catholic population) and Asian-American Catholics, it is doubtful they will outnumber the latter three categories of Catholics in the foreseeable future. Pew Research Center predicts that by 2050 (when the Hispanic population will be 128 million), only 40% of ""third generation Latinos"" will be Catholic, with 22% becoming Protestant, 24% becoming unaffiliated, and the remainder, other. This corresponds to a sharp decline in the Catholic percentage among self-identified Democrats, who are more likely to be nonwhite than Republicans. In one study, three authors found that around 10% of US Catholics are ""Secularists"", ""meaning that their religious identification is purely nominal.""

By state (2017)
Cultural, social, and political views
Politics
Catholicism has had a significant political impact on the United States, and the religion has historically been associated with left-wing politics and the Democratic Party. Since the 1970s, Catholics are often being regarded as swing voters.
The 1840s saw Catholics began to identify with the Democrats against the conservative and evangelical-influenced Whigs. In the 1890s, Catholics favored the Democratic Party over the Republicans. This continued into the 20th century, where Catholics formed a core part of the New Deal Coalition.
Al Smith governor of New York was the first Catholic nominated for president by a major party as the Democratic nominee in the 1928 election.
Two Catholics have been President of the United States: Democratic presidents John F. Kennedy (1961–1963) and Joe Biden (2021–2025), both predominantly of Irish heritage. In 2016, Pope Francis said of Donald Trump: ""A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.""  According to the Pew Research Center, Catholics are the most likely of any major Christian group in the United States to support the morality of casual sex. Surveys have repeatedly indicated that laity are more culturally liberal than the median voter, including on abortion rights and same-sex marriage. However, the Catholic Church officially opposes both. Church leadership tends to lean more orthodox. There are also some fundamentalist-like activist conservative groups.

Criticism by Pope Francis
In 2023, Pope Francis criticized the Catholic Church in the United States as reactionary, saying that ideology had replaced faith in some parts of it. In November 2023, the Pope removed a conservative Texas bishop, Joseph E. Strickland of Tyler, Texas.

Religious Jews regard Judaism as their means of observing the Mosaic covenant, which was established between God and the Israelites, their ancestors. The religion is considered one of the earliest monotheistic religions.
Jewish religious doctrine encompasses a wide body of texts, practices, theological positions, and forms of organization. Among Judaism's core texts is the Torah, the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, and a collection of ancient Hebrew scriptures. The Tanakh, known in English as the Hebrew Bible, has the same contents as the Old Testament in Christianity. In addition to the original written scripture, the supplemental Oral Torah is represented by later texts, such as the Midrash and the Talmud. The Hebrew-language word torah can mean ""teaching"", ""law"", or ""instruction"", although ""Torah"" can also be used as a general term that refers to any Jewish text that expands or elaborates on the original Five Books of Moses. Representing the core of the Jewish spiritual and religious tradition, the Torah is a term and a set of teachings that are explicitly self-positioned as encompassing at least seventy, and potentially infinite, facets and interpretations. Judaism's texts, traditions, and values strongly influenced later Abrahamic religions, including Christianity and Islam. Hebraism, like Hellenism, played a seminal role in the formation of Western civilization through its impact as a core background element of Early Christianity.
Within Judaism, there are a variety of religious movements, most of which emerged from Rabbinic Judaism, which holds that God revealed his laws and commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai in the form of both the Written and Oral Torah. Historically, all or part of this assertion was challenged by various groups such as the Sadducees and Hellenistic Judaism during the Second Temple period; the Karaites during the early and later medieval period; and among segments of the modern non-Orthodox denominations. Some modern branches of Judaism such as Humanistic Judaism may be considered secular or nontheistic. Today, the largest Jewish religious movements are Orthodox Judaism (Haredi and Modern Orthodox), Conservative Judaism, and Reform Judaism. Major sources of difference between these groups are their approaches to halakha (Jewish law), the authority of the rabbinic tradition, and the significance of the State of Israel. Orthodox Judaism maintains that the Torah and halakha are divine in origin, eternal and unalterable, and that they should be strictly followed. Conservative and Reform Judaism are more liberal, with Conservative Judaism generally promoting a more traditionalist interpretation of Judaism's requirements than Reform Judaism. A typical Reform position is that halakha should be viewed as a set of general guidelines rather than as a set of restrictions and obligations whose observance is required of all Jews. Historically, special courts enforced halakha; today, these courts still exist but the practice of Judaism is mostly voluntary. Authority on theological and legal matters is not vested in any one person or organization, but in the sacred texts and the rabbis and scholars who interpret them.
Jews are an ethnoreligious group including those born Jewish, in addition to converts to Judaism. In 2021, the world Jewish population was estimated at 15.2 million, or roughly 0.195% of the total world population, although religious observance varies from strict to none.","Judaism (Hebrew: יַהֲדוּת‎, romanized: Yahăḏūṯ) is an Abrahamic, monotheistic, ethnic religion that comprises the collective spiritual, cultural, and legal traditions of the Jewish people.

Etymology
The term Judaism derives from Iudaismus, a Latinized form of the Ancient Greek Ioudaismos (Koinē Greek: Ἰουδαϊσμός, from the verb ἰουδαΐζειν, ""to side with or imitate the [Judeans]""). Its ultimate source was Hebrew: יהודה, romanized: Yehudah Judah"", which is also the source of the Hebrew term for Judaism, יַהֲדוּת Yahaḏuṯ. The term Ἰουδαϊσμός first appears in the Koine Greek book of 2 Maccabees in the 2nd century BCE (i.e. 2 Maccabees 2:21, 8:1 and 14:38) . In the context of the age and period it meant ""seeking or forming part of a cultural entity"". It resembled its antonym hellenismos, a word signifying people's submission to Hellenistic cultural norms. The conflict between iudaismos and hellenismos lay behind the Maccabean Revolt and hence the invention of the term iudaismos.
Shaye J. D. Cohen writes in his book The Beginnings of Jewishness:

We are tempted, of course, to translate [Ioudaïsmós] as ""Judaism,"" but this translation is too narrow, because in this first occurrence of the term, Ioudaïsmós has not yet been reduced to the designation of a religion. It means rather ""the aggregate of all those characteristics that makes Judaeans Judaean (or Jews Jewish)."" Among these characteristics, to be sure, are practices and beliefs that we would today call ""religious,"" but these practices and beliefs are not the sole content of the term. Thus Ioudaïsmós should be translated not as ""Judaism"" but as Judaeanness.
Daniel R. Schwartz, however, argues that ""Judaism"", especially in the context of the Book of Maccabees, refers to the religion, as opposed to the culture and politics of the Judean state. He believes it reflected the ideological divide between the Pharisees and Sadducees and, implicitly, anti-Hasmonean and pro-Hasmonean factions in Judean society.
According to the Oxford English Dictionary the earliest citation in English where the term was used to mean ""the profession or practice of the Jewish religion; the religious system or polity of the Jews"" is Robert Fabyan's The newe cronycles of Englande and of Fraunce (1516). ""Judaism"" as a direct translation of the Latin Iudaismus first occurred in a 1611 English translation of the Biblical apocrypha (the Deuterocanonical books in the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy), 2 Macc. ii. 21: ""Those that behaved themselves manfully to their honour for Iudaisme.""

History
Origins
'The Covenant' with Abraham in the book of Genesis
A significant part of the Hebrew Bible or Tanakh is an account of the Israelites' relationship with religion and God from their earliest history until the building of the Second Temple (c. 535 BCE). Abraham is hailed as the first Hebrew and the father of the Jewish people. In Genesis, three men, speculated to be God or Archangels, commanded Abraham to circumcise himself and his sons as a sign of the covenant, and was promised by the angels that Isaac, his second son, would inherit the Land of Israel (then called Canaan) and renamed his Wife from 'Sarai', which meant Mockery, to 'Sarah', which meant Princess, and that she would bear him a son in her old age and his descendants shall also be blessed and keep 'the covenant'.

The Torah, Nevi'im, and Ketuvim
In Exodus, the second book of the bible, the descendants of Isaac's son Jacob were enslaved in Egypt, and God commanded Moses to lead the Exodus from Egypt in a vision. Rules and commandments were conveyed to Moses at Sinai; accounted in the Torah, or five books of Moses. These books, together with the Nevi'im and Ketuvim, are known as Torah Shebikhtav, as opposed to the Oral Torah, which refers to the Mishnah and the Talmud. The Nevi'im details historical narratives, and prophetic writings, focusing on the Isrelites settlements in Canaan. While the Ketuvim, a diverse collection of books including the Psalms, Proverbs, and Esther, covers poetic and prose philisophical writings which deviates from the more literalist style of the other books.

The Talmud
Rabbinic tradition holds that the details and interpretation of the Law, called the Oral Torah or ""Oral Law,"" were originally unwritten traditions based on the Law given to Moses at Sinai. However, as the persecutions of the Jews increased and the details were in danger of being forgotten, these oral laws were recorded by Judah ha-Nasi in the Mishnah, redacted c. 200 CE. The Talmud was a compilation of the Mishnah and Gemara, rabbinic commentaries redacted over the next three centuries. The Gemara originated in two major centers of Jewish scholarship, Palestine and Babylonia (Lower Mesopotamia). Correspondingly, two bodies of analysis developed, and two works of Talmud were created. The older compilation is called the Jerusalem Talmud. It was compiled sometime during the 4th century in Palestine.

Historical Analysis
According to critical scholars, the Torah consists of inconsistent texts edited together in a way that calls attention to divergent accounts. Several of these scholars, such as Professor Martin Rose and John Bright, suggest that during the First Temple period the people of Israel believed that each nation had its own version of a god viewed as superior to all other gods. Some suggest that strict monotheism developed during the Babylonian Exile, perhaps in reaction to Zoroastrian dualism. In this view, it was only by the Hellenistic period that most Jews came to believe that their god was the only god and that the notion of a bounded Jewish nation identical with the Jewish religion formed. John Day argues that the origins of biblical Yahweh, El, Asherah, and Ba'al, may be rooted in earlier Canaanite religion, which was centered on a pantheon of gods much like in Greek mythology.

Antiquity
According to the Hebrew Bible, a United Monarchy was established under Saul and continued under King David and Solomon with its capital in Jerusalem. After Solomon's reign, the nation split into two kingdoms, the Kingdom of Israel (in the north) and the Kingdom of Judah (in the south). The Kingdom of Israel was destroyed around 720 BCE, when it was conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire; many people were taken captive from the capital Samaria to Media and the Khabur River valley. The Kingdom of Judah continued as an independent state until it was conquered by Nebuchadnezzar II of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE. The Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and the First Temple, which was at the center of ancient Jewish worship. The Judeans were exiled to Babylon, in what is regarded as the first Jewish diaspora. Later, many of them returned to their homeland after the subsequent conquest of Babylon by the Persian Achaemenid Empire seventy years later, an event known as the Return to Zion. A Second Temple was constructed and old religious practices were resumed.
During the early years of the Second Temple, the highest religious authority was a council known as the Great Assembly, led by Ezra the Scribe. Among other accomplishments of the Great Assembly, the last books of the Bible were written at this time and the canon sealed. Hellenistic Judaism spread to Ptolemaic Egypt from the 3rd century BCE, and its creation sparked widespread controversy in Jewish communities, starting ""conflicts within Jewish communities about accommodating the cultures of occupying powers.""
During the Great Jewish Revolt (66–73 CE), the Romans sacked Jerusalem and destroyed the Second Temple. Later, Roman emperor Hadrian built a pagan idol on the Temple Mount and prohibited circumcision; these acts of ethnocide provoked the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132–136 CE), after which the Romans banned the study of the Torah and the celebration of Jewish holidays, and forcibly removed virtually all Jews from Judea. In 200 CE, however, Jews were granted Roman citizenship and Judaism was recognized as a religio licita (""legitimate religion"") until the rise of Gnosticism and Early Christianity in the fourth century.
Following the destruction of Jerusalem and the expulsion of the Jews, Jewish worship stopped being centrally organized around the Temple, prayer took the place of sacrifice, and worship was rebuilt around the community (represented by a minimum of ten adult men) and the establishment of the authority of rabbis who acted as teachers and leaders of individual communities.
Judaism in pre-Islamic Arabia goes back to the pre-Christian period, and was concentrated in the northwest and south. In the fourth century, the ruling class of the Himyarite Kingdom of pre-Islamic South Arabia converted to Judaism. This situation lasted until the early sixth century, when the Aksumite invasion of Himyar instigated by the massacre of Najran led to a change into Christian rulership.

Defining characteristics and principles of faith
Unlike other ancient Near Eastern gods, the Hebrew God is portrayed as unitary and solitary; consequently, the Hebrew God's principal relationships are not with other gods, but with the world, and more specifically, with the people he created. Judaism thus begins with ethical monotheism: the belief that God is one and is concerned with the actions of mankind. According to the Hebrew Bible, God promised Abraham to make of his offspring a great nation. Many generations later, he commanded the nation of Israel to love and worship only one God; that is, the Jewish nation is to reciprocate God's concern for the world. He also commanded the Jewish people to love one another; that is, Jews are to imitate God's love for people.
Thus, although there is an esoteric tradition in Judaism in Kabbalah, Rabbinic scholar Max Kadushin has characterized normative Judaism as ""normal mysticism"", because it involves everyday personal experiences of God through ways or modes that are common to all Jews. This is played out through the observance of the halakha, or Jewish law, and given verbal expression in the Birkat Ha-Mizvot, the short blessings that are spoken every time a positive commandment is to be fulfilled:

The ordinary, familiar, everyday things and occurrences we have, constitute occasions for the experience of God. Such things as one's daily sustenance, the very day itself, are felt as manifestations of God's loving-kindness, calling for the Berakhot. Kedushah, holiness, which is nothing else than the imitation of God, is concerned with daily conduct, with being gracious and merciful, with keeping oneself from defilement by idolatry, adultery, and the shedding of blood. The Birkat Ha-Mitzwot evokes the consciousness of holiness at a rabbinic rite, but the objects employed in the majority of these rites are non-holy and of general character, while the several holy objects are non-theurgic. And not only do ordinary things and occurrences bring with them the experience of God. Everything that happens to a man evokes that experience, evil as well as good, for a Berakah is said also at evil tidings. Hence, although the experience of God is like none other, the occasions for experiencing Him, for having a consciousness of Him, are manifold, even if we consider only those that call for Berakot.
Whereas Jewish philosophers often debate whether God is immanent or transcendent, and whether people have free will or their lives are determined, halakha is a system through which any Jew acts to bring God into the world.
Ethical monotheism is central in all sacred or normative texts of Judaism. However, monotheism has not always been followed in practice. The Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh) records and repeatedly condemns the widespread worship of other gods in ancient Israel. In the Greco-Roman era, many different interpretations of monotheism existed in Judaism, including the interpretations that gave rise to Christianity.
Moreover, some have argued that Judaism is a non-creedal religion that does not require one to believe in God. For some, observance of halakha is more important than belief in God per se. The debate about whether one can speak of authentic or normative Judaism is not only a debate among religious Jews but also among historians.
In continental Europe, Judaism is heavily associated with and most often thought of as Orthodox Judaism.

Core tenets
In the strict sense, in Judaism, unlike Christianity and Islam, there are no fixed universally binding articles of faith, due to their incorporation into the liturgy. Scholars throughout Jewish history have proposed numerous formulations of Judaism's core tenets, all of which have met with criticism. The most popular formulation is Maimonides' thirteen principles of faith, developed in the 12th century. According to Maimonides, any Jew who rejects even one of these principles would be considered an apostate and a heretic. Jewish scholars have held points of view diverging in various ways from Maimonides' principles. Thus, within Reform Judaism only the first five principles are endorsed.
In Maimonides' time, his list of tenets was criticized by Hasdai Crescas and Joseph Albo. Albo and the Raavad argued that Maimonides' principles contained too many items that, while true, were not fundamentals of the faith
Along these lines, the ancient historian Josephus emphasized practices and observances rather than religious beliefs, associating apostasy with a failure to observe halakha and maintaining that the requirements for conversion to Judaism included circumcision and adherence to traditional customs. Maimonides' principles were largely ignored over the next few centuries. Later, two poetic restatements of these principles (""Ani Ma'amin"" and ""Yigdal"") became integrated into many Jewish liturgies, leading to their eventual near-universal acceptance.
The oldest non-Rabbinic instance of articles of faith were formulated, under Islamic influence, by the 12th century Karaite figure Judah ben Elijah Hadassi:

(1) God is the Creator of all created beings; (2) He is premundane and has no peer or associate; (3) the whole universe is created; (4) God called Moses and the other Prophets of the Biblical canon; (5) the Law of Moses alone is true; (6) to know the language of the Bible is a religious duty; (7) the Temple at Jerusalem is the palace of the world's Ruler; (8) belief in Resurrection contemporaneous with the advent of the Messiah; (9) final judgment; (10) retribution.
In modern times, Judaism lacks a centralized authority that would dictate an exact religious dogma. Because of this, many different variations on the basic beliefs are considered within the scope of Judaism. Even so, all Jewish religious movements are, to a greater or lesser extent, based on the principles of the Hebrew Bible or various commentaries such as the Talmud and Midrash. Judaism also universally recognizes the Biblical Covenant between God and the Patriarch Abraham as well as the additional aspects of the Covenant revealed to Moses, who is considered Judaism's greatest prophet. In the Mishnah, a core text of Rabbinic Judaism, acceptance of the Divine origins of this covenant is considered an essential aspect of Judaism and those who reject the Covenant forfeit their share in the World to Come.
Establishing the core tenets of Judaism in the modern era is even more difficult, given the number and diversity of the contemporary Jewish denominations. Even if to restrict the problem to the most influential intellectual trends of the nineteenth and twentieth century, the matter remains complicated. Thus, for instance, Joseph Soloveitchik's (associated with the Modern Orthodox movement) answer to modernity is constituted upon the identification of Judaism with following the halakha whereas its ultimate goal is to bring the holiness down to the world. Mordecai Kaplan, the founder of the Reconstructionist Judaism, abandons the idea of religion for the sake of identifying Judaism with civilization and by means of the latter term and secular translation of the core ideas, he tries to embrace as many Jewish denominations as possible. In turn, Solomon Schechter's Conservative Judaism was identical with the tradition understood as the interpretation of Torah, in itself being the history of the constant updates and adjustment of the Law performed by means of the creative interpretation. Finally, David Philipson draws the outlines of the Reform movement in Judaism by opposing it to the strict and traditional rabbinical approach and thus comes to the conclusions similar to that of the Conservative movement.

Legal literature
The basis of halakha and tradition is the Torah (also known as the Pentateuch or the Five Books of Moses). According to rabbinic tradition, there are 613 commandments in the Torah. Some of these laws are directed only to men or to women, some only to the ancient priestly groups, the Kohanim and Leviyim (members of the tribe of Levi), some only to farmers within the Land of Israel. Many laws were only applicable when the Temple in Jerusalem existed, and only 369 of these commandments are still applicable today.
While there have been Jewish groups whose beliefs were based on the written text of the Torah alone (e.g., the Sadducees, and the Karaites), most Jews believe in the oral law. These oral traditions were transmitted by the Pharisee school of thought of ancient Judaism and were later recorded in written form and expanded upon by the rabbis.
According to Rabbinical Jewish tradition, God gave both the Written Law (the Torah) and the Oral Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai. The Oral law is the oral tradition as relayed by God to Moses and from him, transmitted and taught to the sages (rabbinic leaders) of each subsequent generation.
For centuries, the Torah appeared only as a written text transmitted in parallel with the oral tradition. Fearing that the oral teachings might be forgotten, Rabbi Judah haNasi undertook the mission of consolidating the various opinions into one body of law which became known as the Mishnah.
The Mishnah consists of 63 tractates codifying halakha, which are the basis of the Talmud. According to Abraham ben David, the Mishnah was compiled by Rabbi Judah haNasi after the destruction of Jerusalem, in anno mundi 3949, which corresponds to 189 CE.
Over the next four centuries, the Mishnah underwent discussion and debate in both of the world's major Jewish communities (in Israel and Babylonia). The commentaries from each of these communities were eventually compiled into the two Talmuds, the Jerusalem Talmud (Talmud Yerushalmi) and the Babylonian Talmud (Talmud Bavli). These have been further expounded by commentaries of various Torah scholars during the ages.
In the text of the Torah, many words are left undefined, and many procedures are mentioned without explanation or instructions. Such phenomena are sometimes offered to validate the viewpoint that the Written Law has always been transmitted with a parallel oral tradition, illustrating the assumption that the reader is already familiar with the details from other, i.e., oral, sources.
Halakha, the rabbinic Jewish way of life, then, is based on a combined reading of the Torah, and the oral tradition—the Mishnah, the halakhic Midrash, the Talmud and its commentaries. The halakha has developed slowly, through a precedent-based system. The literature of questions to rabbis, and their considered answers, is referred to as responsa (Hebrew Sheelot U-Teshuvot). Over time, as practices develop, codes of halakha are written that are based on the responsa; the most important code, the Shulchan Aruch, largely determines Orthodox religious practice today.

Jewish philosophy
Jewish philosophy refers to the conjunction between serious study of philosophy and Jewish theology. Major Jewish philosophers include Philo of Alexandria, Solomon ibn Gabirol, Saadia Gaon, Judah Halevi, Maimonides, and Gersonides. Major changes occurred in response to the Enlightenment (late 18th to early 19th century) leading to the post-Enlightenment Jewish philosophers. Modern Jewish philosophy consists of both Orthodox and non-Orthodox oriented philosophy. Notable among Orthodox Jewish philosophers are Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler, Joseph B. Soloveitchik, and Yitzchok Hutner. Well-known non-Orthodox Jewish philosophers include Martin Buber, Franz Rosenzweig, Mordecai Kaplan, Abraham Joshua Heschel, Will Herberg, and Emmanuel Lévinas.

Rabbinic hermeneutics
Orthodox and many other Jews do not believe that the revealed Torah consists solely of its written contents, but of its interpretations as well. The study of Torah (in its widest sense, to include both poetry, narrative, and law, and both the Hebrew Bible and the Talmud) is in Judaism itself a sacred act of central importance. For the sages of the Mishnah and Talmud, and for their successors today, the study of Torah was therefore not merely a means to learn the contents of God's revelation, but an end in itself. According to the Talmud:

These are the things for which a person enjoys the dividends in this world while the principal remains for the person to enjoy in the world to come; they are: honoring parents, loving deeds of kindness, and making peace between one person and another. But the study of the Torah is equal to them all. (Talmud Shabbat 127a).
In Judaism, ""the study of Torah can be a means of experiencing God"". Reflecting on the contribution of the Amoraim and Tanaim to contemporary Judaism, Professor Jacob Neusner observed:

The rabbi's logical and rational inquiry is not mere logic-chopping. It is a most serious and substantive effort to locate in trivialities the fundamental principles of the revealed will of God to guide and sanctify the most specific and concrete actions in the workaday world. ... Here is the mystery of Talmudic Judaism: the alien and remote conviction that the intellect is an instrument not of unbelief and desacralization but of sanctification.
To study the Written Torah and the Oral Torah in light of each other is thus also to study how to study the word of God.
In the study of Torah, the sages formulated and followed various logical and hermeneutical principles. According to David Stern, all Rabbinic hermeneutics rest on two basic axioms:

first, the belief in the omni-significance of Scripture, in the meaningfulness of its every word, letter, even (according to one famous report) scribal flourish; second, the claim of the essential unity of Scripture as the expression of the single divine will.
These two principles make possible a great variety of interpretations. According to the Talmud:

A single verse has several meanings, but no two verses hold the same meaning. It was taught in the school of R. Ishmael: 'Behold, My word is like fire—declares the Lord—and like a hammer that shatters rock' (Jer 23:29). Just as this hammer produces many sparks (when it strikes the rock), so a single verse has several meanings."" (Talmud Sanhedrin 34a).
Observant Jews thus view the Torah as dynamic, because it contains within it a host of interpretations.
According to Rabbinic tradition, all valid interpretations of the written Torah were revealed to Moses at Sinai in oral form, and handed down from teacher to pupil (The oral revelation is in effect coextensive with the Talmud itself). When different rabbis forwarded conflicting interpretations, they sometimes appealed to hermeneutic principles to legitimize their arguments; some rabbis claim that these principles were themselves revealed by God to Moses at Sinai.
Thus, Hillel called attention to seven commonly used hermeneutical principles in the interpretation of laws (baraita at the beginning of Sifra); R. Ishmael, thirteen (baraita at the beginning of Sifra; this collection is largely an amplification of that of Hillel). Eliezer b. Jose ha-Gelili listed 32, largely used for the exegesis of narrative elements of Torah. All the hermeneutic rules scattered through the Talmudim and Midrashim have been collected by Malbim in Ayyelet ha-Shachar, the introduction to his commentary on the Sifra. Nevertheless, R. Ishmael's 13 principles are perhaps the ones most widely known; they constitute an important, and one of Judaism's earliest, contributions to logic, hermeneutics, and jurisprudence. Judah Hadassi incorporated Ishmael's principles into Karaite Judaism in the 12th century. Today R. Ishmael's 13 principles are incorporated into the Jewish prayer book to be read by observant Jews on a daily basis.

Jewish identity
Distinction between Jews as a people and Judaism
According to Daniel Boyarin, the underlying distinction between religion and ethnicity is foreign to Judaism itself, and is one form of the dualism between spirit and flesh that has its origin in Platonic philosophy and that permeated Hellenistic Judaism. Consequently, in his view, Judaism does not fit easily into conventional Western categories, such as religion, ethnicity, or culture. Boyarin suggests that this in part reflects the fact that much of Judaism's more than 3,000-year history predates the rise of Western culture and occurred outside the West (that is, Europe, particularly medieval and modern Europe). During this time, Jews experienced slavery, anarchic and theocratic self-government, conquest, occupation, and exile. In the Jewish diaspora, they were in contact with, and influenced by, ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Persian, and Hellenic cultures, as well as modern movements such as the Enlightenment (see Haskalah) and the rise of nationalism, which would bear fruit in the form of a Jewish state in their ancient homeland, the Land of Israel. Thus, Boyarin has argued that ""Jewishness disrupts the very categories of identity, because it is not national, not genealogical, not religious, but all of these, in dialectical tension.""
In contrast to this point of view, practices such as Humanistic Judaism reject the religious aspects of Judaism, while retaining certain cultural traditions.

Who is a Jew?
According to Rabbinic Judaism, a Jew is anyone who was either born of a Jewish mother or who converted to Judaism in accordance with halakha. Reconstructionist Judaism and the larger denominations of worldwide Progressive Judaism (also known as Liberal or Reform Judaism) accept the child as Jewish if one of the parents is Jewish, if the parents raise the child with a Jewish identity, but not the smaller regional branches. All mainstream forms of Judaism today are open to sincere converts, although conversion has traditionally been discouraged since the time of the Talmud. The conversion process is evaluated by an authority, and the convert is examined on his or her sincerity and knowledge. Converts are called ""ben Abraham"" or ""bat Abraham"", (son or daughter of Abraham). Conversions have on occasion been overturned. In 2008, Israel's highest religious court invalidated the conversion of 40,000 Jews, mostly from Russian immigrant families, even though they had been approved by an Orthodox rabbi.
Rabbinical Judaism maintains that a Jew, whether by birth or conversion, is a Jew forever. Thus a Jew who claims to be an atheist or converts to another religion is still considered by traditional Judaism to be Jewish. According to some sources, the Reform movement has maintained that a Jew who has converted to another religion is no longer a Jew, and the Israeli Government has also taken that stance after Supreme Court cases and statutes. However, the Reform movement has indicated that this is not so cut and dried, and different situations call for consideration and differing actions. For example, Jews who have converted under duress may be permitted to return to Judaism ""without any action on their part but their desire to rejoin the Jewish community"" and ""A proselyte who has become an apostate remains, nevertheless, a Jew"".
Karaite Judaism believes that Jewish identity can only be transmitted by patrilineal descent. Although a minority of modern Karaites believe that Jewish identity requires that both parents be Jewish, and not only the father. They argue that only patrilineal descent can transmit Jewish identity on the grounds that all descent in the Torah went according to the male line.
The question of what determines Jewish identity in the State of Israel was given new impetus when, in the 1950s, David Ben-Gurion requested opinions on mihu Yehudi (""Who is a Jew"") from Jewish religious authorities and intellectuals worldwide in order to settle citizenship questions. This is still not settled, and occasionally resurfaces in Israeli politics.
Historical definitions of Jewish identity have traditionally been based on halakhic definitions of matrilineal descent, and halakhic conversions. Historical definitions of who is a Jew date back to the codification of the Oral Torah into the Babylonian Talmud, around 200 CE. Interpretations of sections of the Tanakh, such as Deuteronomy 7:1–5, by Jewish sages, are used as a warning against intermarriage between Jews and Canaanites because ""[the non-Jewish husband] will cause your child to turn away from Me and they will worship the gods (i.e., idols) of others."" Leviticus 24 says that the son in a marriage between a Hebrew woman and an Egyptian man is ""of the community of Israel."" This is complemented by Ezra 10, where Israelites returning from Babylon vow to put aside their gentile wives and their children. A popular theory is that the rape of Jewish women in captivity brought about the law of Jewish identity being inherited through the maternal line, although scholars challenge this theory citing the Talmudic establishment of the law from the pre-exile period. Since the anti-religious Haskalah movement of the late 18th and 19th centuries, halakhic interpretations of Jewish identity have been challenged.

Jewish demographics
The total number of Jews worldwide is difficult to assess because the definition of ""who is a Jew"" is problematic; not all Jews identify themselves as Jewish, and some who identify as Jewish are not considered so by other Jews. According to the Jewish Year Book (1901), the global Jewish population in 1900 was around 11 million. The latest available data is from the World Jewish Population Survey of 2002 and the Jewish Year Calendar (2005). In 2002, according to the Jewish Population Survey, there were 13.3 million Jews around the world. The Jewish Year Calendar cites 14.6 million. It is 0.25% of world population.
Jewish population growth is currently near zero percent, with 0.3% growth from 2000 to 2001. The overall growth rate of Jews in Israel is 1.7% annually, and is consistently growing through natural population growth and extensive immigration. The diaspora countries, by contrast, have low Jewish birth rates, an increasingly elderly age composition, high rates of interreligious marriage and a negative balance of people leaving Judaism versus those joining.
In 2022, the world Jewish population was estimated at 15.2 million, with the majority living in one of two countries: Israel and the United States. About 46.6% of all Jews resided in Israel (6.9 million) and another 6 million Jews resided in the United States, with most of the remainder living in Europe, and other groups spread throughout Canada, Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Australia.
Jewish demographics represent diverse historical and cultural trajectories. Ashkenazi Jews, Sephardic Jews, Ethiopian Jews (Beta Israel), Mizrahi Jews, and Romaniote Jews, may possess unique customs and practices.
In Israel, the classification of Jewish observance into categories like Haredi, Dati, Masorti, and Hiloni was developed by sociologists and researchers studying the religious and cultural landscape of Israeli society. These distinctions emerged from surveys and studies conducted by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics and scholars such as Shmuel Sandler, who explored how religious practices varied among different segments of the Jewish population. The categories were created to better understand the range of religious adherence, from the ultra-Orthodox Haredim to the secular Hilonim, with Dati and Masorti representing intermediary groups.

Jewish religious movements
Rabbinic Judaism
Rabbinic Judaism (or in some older sources, Rabbinism; Hebrew: ""Yahadut Rabanit"" – יהדות רבנית) has been the mainstream form of Judaism since the 6th century CE, after the codification of the Talmud. It is characterised by the belief that the Written Torah (Written Law) cannot be correctly interpreted without reference to the Oral Torah and the voluminous literature specifying what behavior is sanctioned by the Law.
The Jewish Enlightenment of the late 18th century resulted in the division of Western Jewry (primarily, the Ashkenazi, but also western part of Sephardim and Italian rite Jews, a.k.a. Italkim, and Greek Romaniote Jews—both last groups are considered distinct from Ashkenazim and Sephardim) into religious movements or denominations, especially in North America and Anglophone countries. The main denominations today outside Israel (where the situation is rather different) are Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform. The notion ""traditional Judaism"" includes the Orthodox with Conservative or solely the Orthodox Jews:

 
Orthodox Judaism holds that both the Written and Oral Torah were divinely revealed to Moses and that the laws within it are binding and unchanging. Orthodox Jews generally consider commentaries on the Shulchan Aruch (a condensed codification of halakha that largely favoured Sephardic traditions) to be the definitive codification of halakha. Orthodoxy places a high importance on Maimonides' 13 principles as a definition of Jewish faith.
Orthodoxy is often divided into Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism. Haredi is less accommodating to modernity and has less interest in non-Jewish disciplines, and it may be distinguished from Modern Orthodox Judaism in practice by its styles of dress and more stringent practices. Subsets of Haredi Judaism along both ethnic and ideological lines include Hardal (""Nationalist Haredi"" within Religious Zionism); Hasidic Judaism, which is rooted in the Kabbalah and distinguished by reliance on a Rebbe or religious teacher; their traditionalist opponents the Misnagdim (also known as Lithuanian or Lita'im); and Sephardic Haredi Judaism, which emerged among Sephardic and Mizrahi (Asian and North African) Jews in Israel. ""Centrist"" Orthodoxy (Joseph B. Soloveitchik) is sometimes also distinguished.

Conservative Judaism (known as Masorti Judaism outside North America and Israel) is characterized by a commitment to traditional halakha and customs, including observance of Shabbat and kashrut, a deliberately non-fundamentalist teaching of Jewish principles of faith, a positive attitude toward modern culture, and an acceptance of both traditional rabbinic and modern scholarship when considering Jewish religious texts. Conservative Judaism teaches that halakha is not static, but has always developed in response to changing conditions. It holds that the Torah is a divine document written by prophets inspired by God and reflecting his will, but rejects the Orthodox position that it was dictated by God to Moses. Conservative Judaism holds that the Oral Law is divine and normative, but holds that both the Written and Oral Law may be interpreted by the rabbis to reflect modern sensibilities and suit modern conditions.
Reform Judaism, called Liberal or Progressive Judaism in many countries, defines Judaism in relatively universalist terms, rejects most of the ritual and ceremonial laws of the Torah while observing moral laws, and emphasizes the ethical call of the Prophets. Reform Judaism has developed an egalitarian prayer service in the vernacular (along with Hebrew in many cases) and emphasizes personal connection to Jewish tradition.
Reconstructionist Judaism, like Reform Judaism, does not hold that halakha, as such, requires observance, but unlike Reform, Reconstructionist thought emphasizes the role of the community in deciding what observances to follow. It is sometimes recognized as the fourth major stream of Judaism.
Jewish Renewal is a recent North American movement which focuses on spirituality and social justice but does not address issues of halakha. Men and women participate equally in prayer.
Humanistic Judaism is a small non-theistic movement centered in North America and Israel that emphasizes Jewish culture and history as the sources of Jewish identity.
Subbotniks (Sabbatarians) are a movement of Jews of Russian ethnic origin in the 18th–20th centuries, the majority of whom belonged to Rabbinic and Karaite Judaism. Many settled in the Holy Land as part of the Zionist First Aliyah in order to escape oppression in the Russian Empire and later mostly intermarried with other Jews, their descendants included Alexander Zaïd, Major-General Alik Ron, and the mother of Ariel Sharon.

Sephardi and Mizrahi Judaism
While traditions and customs vary between discrete communities, it can be said that Sephardi (Iberian, for example, most Jews from France and the Netherlands) and Mizrahi (Oriental) Jewish communities do not generally adhere to the ""movement"" framework popular in and among Ashkenazi Jewry. Historically, Sephardi and Mizrahi communities have eschewed denominations in favour of a ""big tent"" approach. This is particularly the case in contemporary Israel, which is home to the largest communities of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews in the world. (However, individual Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews or some their communities may be members of or attend synagogues that do adhere to one Ashkenazi-inflected movement or another.) Among the pioneers of Reform Judaism in the 1820s there was the Sephardic congregation Beth Elohim in Charleston, South Carolina. A part of the European Sephardim were also linked with the Judaic modernization.
Sephardi and Mizrahi observance of Judaism tends toward the traditional (Orthodox) and prayer rites are reflective of this, with the text of each rite being largely unchanged since their respective inception. Observant Sephardim may follow the teachings of a particular rabbi or school of thought; for example, the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel.

Jewish movements in Israel
In Israel, as in the West, Judaism is also divided into major Orthodox, Conservative and Reform traditions. At the same time, for statistical and practical purposes, a different division of society is used there on the basis of a person's attitude to religion.
Most Jewish Israelis classify themselves as ""secular"" (hiloni), ""traditional"" (masorti), ""religious"" (dati) or ""ultra-religious"" (haredi). The term ""secular"" is more popular as a self-description among Israeli families of western (European) origin, whose Jewish identity may be a very powerful force in their lives, but who see it as largely independent of traditional religious belief and practice. This portion of the population largely ignores organized religious life, be it of the official Israeli rabbinate (Orthodox) or of the liberal movements common to diaspora Judaism (Reform, Conservative).
The term ""traditional"" (masorti) is most common as a self-description among Israeli families of ""eastern"" origin (i.e., the Middle East, Central Asia, and North Africa). This term, as commonly used, has nothing to do with Conservative Judaism, which also names itself ""Masorti"" outside North America. Only a few authors, like Elliot Nelson Dorff, consider the American Conservative (masorti) movement and Israeli masorti sector to be one and the same. There is a great deal of ambiguity in the ways ""secular"" and ""traditional"" are used in Israel: they often overlap, and they cover an extremely wide range in terms of worldview and practical religious observance. The term ""Orthodox"" is not popular in Israeli discourse, although the percentage of Jews who come under that category is far greater than in the Jewish diaspora. What would be called ""Orthodox"" in the diaspora includes what is commonly called dati (religious, including religious zionist) or haredi (ultra-Orthodox) in Israel. The former term includes what is called ""religious Zionism"" or the ""National Orthodox"" community, as well as what has become known over the past decade or so as haredi-leumi (nationalist haredi), or ""Hardal"", which combines a largely haredi lifestyle with nationalist ideology. (Some people, in Yiddish, also refer to observant Orthodox Jews as frum, as opposed to frei (more liberal Jews)).

Karaites and Samaritans
Karaite Judaism defines itself as the remnants of the non-Rabbinic Jewish sects of the Second Temple period, such as the Sadducees. The Karaites (""Scripturalists"") accept only the Hebrew Bible and what they view as the Peshat (""simple"" meaning); they do not accept non-biblical writings as authoritative. Some European Karaites do not see themselves as part of the Jewish community at all, although most do.
The Samaritans, a very small community located entirely around Mount Gerizim in the Nablus/Shechem region of the West Bank and in Holon, near Tel Aviv in Israel, regard themselves as the descendants of the Israelites of the Iron Age kingdom of Israel. Their religious practices are based on the literal text of the written Torah (Five Books of Moses), which they view as the only authoritative scripture (with a special regard also for the Samaritan Book of Joshua).

Haymanot (Ethiopian Judaism)
Haymanot (meaning ""religion"" in Ge'ez and Amharic) refers the Judaism practiced by Ethiopian Jews. This version of Judaism differs substantially from Rabbinic, Karaite, and Samaritan Judaisms, Ethiopian Jews having diverged from their coreligionists earlier. Sacred scriptures (the Orit) are written in Ge'ez, not Hebrew, and dietary laws are based strictly on the text of the Orit, without explication from ancillary commentaries. Holidays also differ, with some Rabbinic holidays not observed in Ethiopian Jewish communities, and some additional holidays, like Sigd.

Noahide (B'nei Noah movement)
Noahidism is a Jewish religious movement based on the Seven Laws of Noah and their traditional interpretations within Rabbinic Judaism. According to the halakha, non-Jews (gentiles) are not obligated to convert to Judaism, but they are required to observe the Seven Laws of Noah to be assured of a place in the World to Come (Olam Ha-Ba), the final reward of the righteous. The divinely ordained penalty for violating any of the Laws of Noah is discussed in the Talmud, but in practical terms it is subject to the working legal system which is established by the society at large. Those who subscribe to the observance of the Noahic Covenant are referred to as B'nei Noach (Hebrew: בני נח, 'Children of Noah') or Noahides (/ˈnoʊ.ə.haɪdɪs/). Supporting organizations have been established around the world over the past decades by both Noahides and Orthodox Jews.
Historically, the Hebrew term B'nei Noach has applied to all non-Jews as descendants of Noah. However, nowadays it's primarily used to refer specifically to those non-Jews who observe the Seven Laws of Noah.

Jewish observances
Jewish ethics
Jewish ethics may be guided by halakhic traditions, by customs of etiquette, by other moral principles, or by central Jewish virtues. Jewish ethical practice is typically understood to be marked by values such as justice, truth, peace, loving-kindness (chesed), compassion, humility, and self-respect. Specific Jewish ethical practices include practices of charity (tzedakah) and refraining from negative speech (lashon hara). Proper ethical practices regarding sexuality and many other issues are subjects of dispute among Jews.

Prayers
Traditionally, Jews recite prayers three times daily, Shacharit, Mincha, and Ma'ariv with a fourth prayer, Mussaf added on Shabbat and holidays. At the heart of each service is the Amidah or Shemoneh Esrei. Another key prayer in many services is the declaration of faith, the Shema Yisrael (or Shema). The Shema is the recitation of a verse from the Torah (Deuteronomy 6:4): Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad—""Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God! The Lord is One!""

Most of the prayers in a traditional Jewish service can be recited in solitary prayer, although communal prayer is preferred. Communal prayer requires a quorum of ten adult Jews, called a minyan. In nearly all Orthodox and a few Conservative circles, only male Jews are counted toward a minyan; most Conservative Jews and members of other Jewish denominations count female Jews as well.
In addition to prayer services, observant traditional Jews recite prayers and benedictions throughout the day when performing various acts. Prayers are recited upon waking up in the morning, before eating or drinking different foods, after eating a meal, and so on.
The approach to prayer varies among the Jewish denominations. Differences can include the texts of prayers, the frequency of prayer, the number of prayers recited at various religious events, the use of musical instruments and choral music, and whether prayers are recited in the traditional liturgical languages or the vernacular. In general, Orthodox and Conservative congregations adhere most closely to tradition, and Reform and Reconstructionist synagogues are more likely to incorporate translations and contemporary writings in their services. Also, in most Conservative synagogues, and all Reform and Reconstructionist congregations, women participate in prayer services on an equal basis with men, including roles traditionally filled only by men, such as reading from the Torah. In addition, many Reform temples use musical accompaniment such as organs and mixed choirs.

Religious clothing
A kippah (Hebrew: כִּפָּה, plural kippot; Yiddish: יאַרמלקע, yarmulke) is a slightly rounded brimless skullcap worn by many Jews while praying, eating, reciting blessings, or studying Jewish religious texts, and at all times by some Jewish men. In Orthodox communities, only men wear kippot; in non-Orthodox communities, some women also wear kippot. Kippot range in size from a small round beanie that covers only the back of the head to a large, snug cap that covers the whole crown.
Tzitzit (Hebrew: צִיציִת) (Ashkenazi pronunciation: tzitzis) are special knotted ""fringes"" or ""tassels"" found on the four corners of the tallit (Hebrew: טַלִּית) (Ashkenazi pronunciation: tallis), or prayer shawl. The tallit is worn by Jewish men and some Jewish women during the prayer service. Customs vary regarding when a Jew begins wearing a tallit. In the Sephardi community, boys wear a tallit from bar mitzvah age. In some Ashkenazi communities, it is customary to wear one only after marriage. A tallit katan (small tallit) is a fringed garment worn under the clothing throughout the day. In some Orthodox circles, the fringes are allowed to hang freely outside the clothing.
Tefillin (Hebrew: תְפִלִּין), known in English as phylacteries (from the Greek word φυλακτήριον, meaning safeguard or amulet), are two square leather boxes containing biblical verses, attached to the forehead and wound around the left arm by leather straps. They are worn during weekday morning prayer by observant Jewish men and some Jewish women.
A kittel (Yiddish: קיטל), a white knee-length overgarment, is worn by prayer leaders and some observant traditional Jews on the High Holidays. It is traditional for the head of the household to wear a kittel at the Passover seder in some communities, and some grooms wear one under the wedding canopy. Jewish males are buried in a tallit and sometimes also a kittel which are part of the tachrichim (burial garments).

Jewish holidays
Jewish holidays are special days in the Jewish calendar, which celebrate moments in Jewish history, as well as central themes in the relationship between God and the world, such as creation, revelation, and redemption.

Shabbat
Shabbat, the weekly day of rest lasting from shortly before sundown on Friday night to nightfall on Saturday night, commemorates God's day of rest after six days of creation. It plays a pivotal role in Jewish practice and is governed by a large corpus of religious law. At sundown on Friday, the woman of the house welcomes the Shabbat by lighting two or more candles and reciting a blessing. The evening meal begins with the Kiddush, a blessing recited aloud over a cup of wine, and the Mohtzi, a blessing recited over the bread. It is customary to have challah, two braided loaves of bread, on the table. During Shabbat, Jews are forbidden to engage in any activity that falls under 39 categories of melakhah, translated literally as ""work"". In fact, the activities banned on the Sabbath are not ""work"" in the usual sense: They include such actions as lighting a fire, writing, using money and carrying in the public domain. The prohibition of lighting a fire has been extended in the modern era to driving a car, which involves burning fuel and using electricity.

Three pilgrimage festivals
Jewish holy days (chaggim), celebrate landmark events in Jewish history, such as the Exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah, and sometimes mark the change of seasons and transitions in the agricultural cycle. The three major festivals, Sukkot, Passover and Shavuot, are called ""regalim"" (derived from the Hebrew word ""regel"", or foot). On the three regalim, it was customary for the Israelites to make pilgrimages to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the Temple:

 Passover (Pesach) is a week-long holiday beginning on the evening of the 14th day of Nisan (the first month in the Hebrew calendar), that commemorates the Exodus from Egypt. Outside Israel, Passover is celebrated for eight days. In ancient times, it coincided with the barley harvest. It is the only holiday that centers on home-service, the Seder. Leavened products (chametz) are removed from the house prior to the holiday and are not consumed throughout the week. Homes are thoroughly cleaned to ensure no bread or bread by-products remain, and a symbolic burning of the last vestiges of chametz is conducted on the morning of the Seder. Matzo is eaten instead of bread.
Shavuot (""Pentecost"" or ""Feast of Weeks"") celebrates the revelation of the Torah to the Israelites on Mount Sinai. Also known as the Festival of Bikurim, or first fruits, it coincided in biblical times with the wheat harvest. Shavuot customs include all-night study marathons known as Tikkun Leil Shavuot, eating dairy foods (cheesecake and blintzes are special favorites), reading the Book of Ruth, decorating homes and synagogues with greenery, and wearing white clothing, symbolizing purity.
 Sukkot (""Tabernacles"" or ""The Festival of Booths"") commemorates the Israelites' forty years of wandering through the desert on their way to the Promised Land. It is celebrated through the construction of temporary booths called sukkot (sing. sukkah) that represent the temporary shelters of the Israelites during their wandering. It coincides with the fruit harvest and marks the end of the agricultural cycle. Jews around the world eat in sukkot for seven days and nights. Sukkot concludes with Shemini Atzeret, where Jews begin to pray for rain and Simchat Torah, ""Rejoicing of the Torah"", a holiday which marks reaching the end of the Torah reading cycle and beginning all over again. The occasion is celebrated with singing and dancing with the Torah scrolls. Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah are technically considered to be a separate holiday and not a part of Sukkot.

High Holy Days
The High Holidays (Yamim Noraim or ""Days of Awe"") revolve around judgment and forgiveness:

Rosh Hashanah, (also Yom Ha-Zikkaron or ""Day of Remembrance"", and Yom Teruah, or ""Day of the Sounding of the Shofar""). Rosh Hashanah is the Jewish New Year (literally, ""head of the year""), although it falls on the first day of the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar, Tishri. Rosh Hashanah marks the beginning of the 10-day period of atonement leading up to Yom Kippur, during which Jews are commanded to search their souls and make amends for sins committed, intentionally or not, throughout the year. Holiday customs include blowing the shofar, or ram's horn, in the synagogue, eating apples and honey, and saying blessings over a variety of symbolic foods, such as pomegranates.
Yom Kippur, (""Day of Atonement"") is the holiest day of the Jewish year. It is a day of communal fasting and praying for forgiveness for one's sins. Observant Jews spend the entire day in the synagogue, sometimes with a short break in the afternoon, reciting prayers from a special holiday prayerbook called a ""Machzor"". Many non-religious Jews make a point of attending synagogue services and fasting on Yom Kippur. On the eve of Yom Kippur, before candles are lit, a prefast meal, the ""seuda mafseket"", is eaten. Synagogue services on the eve of Yom Kippur begin with the Kol Nidre prayer. It is customary to wear white on Yom Kippur, especially for Kol Nidre, and leather shoes are not worn. The following day, prayers are held from morning to evening. The final prayer service, called ""Ne'ilah"", ends with a long blast of the shofar.

Purim
Purim (Hebrew:  Pûrîm ""lots"") is a joyous Jewish holiday that commemorates the deliverance of the Persian Jews from the plot of the evil Haman, who sought to exterminate them, as recorded in the biblical Book of Esther. It is characterized by public recitation of the Book of Esther, mutual gifts of food and drink, charity to the poor, and a celebratory meal (Esther 9:22). Other customs include drinking wine, eating special pastries called hamantashen, dressing up in masks and costumes, and organizing carnivals and parties.
Purim has celebrated annually on the 14th of the Hebrew month of Adar, which occurs in February or March of the Gregorian calendar.

Hanukkah
Hanukkah (Hebrew: חֲנֻכָּה, ""dedication"") also known as the Festival of Lights, is an eight-day Jewish holiday that starts on the 25th day of Kislev (Hebrew calendar). The festival is observed in Jewish homes by the kindling of lights on each of the festival's eight nights, one on the first night, two on the second night and so on.
The holiday was called Hanukkah (meaning ""dedication"") because it marks the re-dedication of the Temple after its desecration by Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Spiritually, Hanukkah commemorates the ""Miracle of the Oil"". According to the Talmud, at the re-dedication of the Temple in Jerusalem following the victory of the Maccabees over the Seleucid Empire, there was only enough consecrated oil to fuel the eternal flame in the Temple for one day. Miraculously, the oil burned for eight days—which was the length of time it took to press, prepare and consecrate new oil.
Hanukkah is not mentioned in the Bible and was never considered a major holiday in Judaism, but it has become much more visible and widely celebrated in modern times, mainly because it falls around the same time as Christmas and has national Jewish overtones that have been emphasized since the establishment of the State of Israel.

Fast days
Tisha B'Av (Hebrew: תשעה באב or ט׳ באב, ""the Ninth of Av"") is a day of mourning and fasting commemorating the destruction of the First and Second Temples, and in later times, the expulsion of the Jews from Spain.
There are three more minor Jewish fast days that commemorate various stages of the destruction of the Temples. They are the 17th Tamuz, the 10th of Tevet and Tzom Gedaliah (the 3rd of Tishrei).

Israeli holidays
The modern holidays of Yom Ha-shoah (Holocaust Remembrance Day), Yom Hazikaron (Israeli Memorial Day) and Yom Ha'atzmaut (Israeli Independence Day) commemorate the horrors of the Holocaust, the fallen soldiers of Israel and victims of terrorism, and Israeli independence, respectively.
There are some who prefer to commemorate those who were killed in the Holocaust on the 10th of Tevet.

Torah readings
The core of festival and Shabbat prayer services is the public reading of the Torah, along with connected readings from the other books of the Tanakh, called Haftarah. Over the course of a year, the whole Torah is read, with the cycle starting over in the autumn, on Simchat Torah.

Synagogues and religious buildings
Synagogues are Jewish houses of prayer and study. They usually contain separate rooms for prayer (the main sanctuary), smaller rooms for study, and often an area for community or educational use. There is no set blueprint for synagogues and the architectural shapes and interior designs of synagogues vary greatly. The Reform movement mostly refer to their synagogues as temples. Some traditional features of a synagogue are:

The ark (called aron ha-kodesh by Ashkenazim and hekhal by Sephardim) where the Torah scrolls are kept (the ark is often closed with an ornate curtain (parochet) outside or inside the ark doors);
The elevated reader's platform (called bimah by Ashkenazim and tebah by Sephardim), where the Torah is read (and services are conducted in Sephardi synagogues);
The eternal light (ner tamid), a continually lit lamp or lantern used as a reminder of the constantly lit menorah of the Temple in Jerusalem
The pulpit, or amud, a lectern facing the Ark where the hazzan or prayer leader stands while praying.
In addition to synagogues, other buildings of significance in Judaism include yeshivas, or institutions of Jewish learning, and mikvahs, which are ritual baths.

Dietary laws: kashrut
The Jewish dietary laws are known as kashrut. Food prepared in accordance with them is termed kosher, and food that is not kosher is also known as treifah or treif. People who observe these laws are colloquially said to be ""keeping kosher"".
Many of the laws apply to animal-based foods. For example, in order to be considered kosher, mammals must have split hooves and chew their cud. The pig is arguably the most well-known example of a non-kosher animal. Although it has split hooves, it does not chew its cud. For seafood to be kosher, the animal must have fins and scales. Certain types of seafood, such as shellfish, crustaceans, and eels, are therefore considered non-kosher. Concerning birds, a list of non-kosher species is given in the Torah. The exact translations of many of the species have not survived, and some non-kosher birds' identities are no longer certain. However, traditions exist about the kashrut status of a few birds. For example, both chickens and turkeys are permitted in most communities. Other types of animals, such as amphibians, reptiles, and most insects, are prohibited altogether.
In addition to the requirement that the species be considered kosher, meat and poultry (but not fish) must come from a healthy animal slaughtered in a process known as shechitah. Without the proper slaughtering practices even an otherwise kosher animal will be rendered treif. The slaughtering process is intended to be quick and relatively painless to the animal. Forbidden parts of animals include the blood, some fats, and the area in and around the sciatic nerve.
Halakha also forbids the consumption of meat and dairy products together. The waiting period between eating meat and eating dairy varies by the order in which they are consumed and by community and can extend for up to six hours. Based on the Biblical injunction against cooking a kid in its mother's milk, this rule is mostly derived from the Oral Torah, the Talmud and Rabbinic law. Chicken and other kosher birds are considered the same as meat under the laws of kashrut, but the prohibition is rabbinic, not biblical.
The use of dishes, serving utensils, and ovens may make food treif that would otherwise be kosher. Utensils that have been used to prepare non-kosher food, or dishes that have held meat and are now used for dairy products, render the food treif under certain conditions.
Furthermore, all Orthodox and some Conservative authorities forbid the consumption of processed grape products made by non-Jews, due to ancient pagan practices of using wine in rituals. Some Conservative authorities permit wine and grape juice made without rabbinic supervision.
The Torah does not give specific reasons for most of the laws of kashrut. However, a number of explanations have been offered, including maintaining ritual purity, teaching impulse control, encouraging obedience to God, improving health, reducing cruelty to animals and preserving the distinctness of the Jewish community. The various categories of dietary laws may have developed for different reasons, and some may exist for multiple reasons. For example, people are forbidden from consuming the blood of birds and mammals because, according to the Torah, this is where animal souls are contained. In contrast, the Torah forbids Israelites from eating non-kosher species because ""they are unclean"". The Kabbalah describes sparks of holiness that are released by the act of eating kosher foods but are too tightly bound in non-kosher foods to be released by eating.
Survival concerns supersede all the laws of kashrut, as they do for most halakhot.

Laws of ritual purity
The Tanakh describes circumstances in which a person who is tahor or ritually pure may become tamei or ritually impure. Some of these circumstances are contact with human corpses or graves, seminal flux, vaginal flux, menstruation, and contact with people who have become impure from any of these. In Rabbinic Judaism, Kohanim, members of the hereditary caste that served as priests in the time of the Temple, are mostly restricted from entering grave sites and touching dead bodies. During the Temple period, such priests (Kohanim) were required to eat their bread offering (Terumah) in a state of ritual purity, which laws eventually led to more rigid laws being enacted, such as hand-washing which became a requisite of all Jews before consuming ordinary bread.

Family purity
An important subcategory of the ritual purity laws relates to the segregation of menstruating women. These laws are also known as niddah, literally ""separation"", or family purity. Vital aspects of halakha for traditionally observant Jews, they are not usually followed by Jews in liberal denominations.
Especially in Orthodox Judaism, the Biblical laws are augmented by Rabbinical injunctions. For example, the Torah mandates that a woman in her normal menstrual period must abstain from sexual intercourse for seven days. A woman whose menstruation is prolonged must continue to abstain for seven more days after bleeding has stopped. The Rabbis conflated ordinary niddah with this extended menstrual period, known in the Torah as zavah, and mandated that a woman may not have sexual intercourse with her husband from the time she begins her menstrual flow until seven days after it ends. In addition, Rabbinical law forbids the husband from touching or sharing a bed with his wife during this period. Afterwards, purification can occur in a ritual bath called a mikveh
Traditional Ethiopian Jews keep menstruating women in separate huts and, similar to Karaite practice, do not allow menstruating women into their temples because of a temple's special sanctity. Emigration to Israel and the influence of other Jewish denominations have led to Ethiopian Jews adopting more normative Jewish practices.

Life-cycle events
Life-cycle events, or rites of passage, occur throughout a Jew's life that serves to strengthen Jewish identity and bind him/her to the entire community:

Brit milah – Welcoming male babies into the covenant through the rite of circumcision on their eighth day of life. The baby boy is also given his Hebrew name in the ceremony. A naming ceremony intended as a parallel ritual for girls, named zeved habat or brit bat, enjoys limited popularity.
Bar mitzvah and Bat mitzvah – This passage from childhood to adulthood takes place when a female Jew is twelve and a male Jew is thirteen years old among Orthodox and some Conservative congregations. In the Reform movement, both girls and boys have their bat/bar mitzvah at age thirteen. This is often commemorated by having the new adults, male only in the Orthodox tradition, lead the congregation in prayer and publicly read a ""portion"" of the Torah.
Marriage – Marriage is an extremely important lifecycle event and an ideal human state. A wedding takes place under a chuppah, or wedding canopy, which symbolizes a happy house. At the end of the ceremony, the groom breaks a glass with his foot, symbolizing the continuous mourning for the destruction of the Temple, and the scattering of the Jewish people. An intermarriage is prohibited, except as within Reform Judaism:

Divorce – Divorce is allowed in accordance with Halakha. The divorce ceremony involves the husband giving the short get document written in Aramaic into the hand of the wife in rabbinical court, that is all. But, since the 11th century among the Ashkenazim and many Sephardim a divorce became prohibited against will of a wife, than a man had way for polygamy. The get contains declaration: ""You are hereby permitted to all men.""

Death and Mourning (Avelut) – The Torah requires burial as soon as possible, even for executed criminals. Judaism has a multi-staged mourning practice. The first stage is called the shiva (literally ""seven"", observed for one week) during which it is traditional to sit at home and be comforted by friends and family, the second is the shloshim (observed for one month) and for those who have lost one of their parents, there is a third stage, avelut yud bet chodesh, which is observed for eleven months. A cremation within Orthodox Judaism permitted only by some leading rabbis in West Europe.

Community leadership
Classical priesthood
The role of the priesthood in Judaism has significantly diminished since the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE when priests attended to the Temple and sacrifices. The priesthood is an inherited position, and although priests no longer have any but ceremonial duties, they are still honoured in many Jewish communities. Many Orthodox Jewish communities believe that they will be needed again for a future Third Temple and need to remain in readiness for future duty:

Kohen (priest) – patrilineal descendant of Aaron, brother of Moses. In the Temple, the kohanim were charged with performing the sacrifices. Today, a Kohen is the first one called up at the reading of the Torah, performs the Priestly Blessing, as well as complying with other unique laws and ceremonies, including the ceremony of redemption of the first-born.
Levi (Levite) – Patrilineal descendant of Levi the son of Jacob. In the Temple in Jerusalem, the levites sang Psalms, performed construction, maintenance, janitorial, and guard duties, assisted the priests, and sometimes interpreted the law and Temple ritual to the public. Today, a Levite is called up second to the reading of the Torah.

Prayer leaders
From the time of the Mishnah and Talmud to the present, Judaism has required specialists or authorities for the practice of very few rituals or ceremonies. A Jew can fulfill most requirements for prayer by himself. Some activities—reading the Torah and haftarah (a supplementary portion from the Prophets or Writings), the prayer for mourners, the blessings for bridegroom and bride, the complete grace after meals—require a minyan, the presence of ten Jews.
The most common professional clergy in a synagogue are:

Rabbi of a congregation – Jewish scholar who is charged with answering the legal questions of a congregation. This role requires ordination by the congregation's preferred authority (i.e., from a respected Orthodox rabbi or, if the congregation is Conservative or Reform, from academic seminaries). A congregation does not necessarily require a rabbi. Some congregations have a rabbi but also allow members of the congregation to act as shatz or baal kriyah (see below).
Hassidic Rebbe – rabbi who is the head of a Hasidic dynasty.
Hazzan (note: the ""h"" denotes voiceless pharyngeal fricative) (cantor) – a trained vocalist who acts as shatz. Chosen for a good voice, knowledge of traditional tunes, understanding of the meaning of the prayers and sincerity in reciting them. A congregation does not need to have a dedicated hazzan.
Jewish prayer services do involve two specified roles, which are sometimes, but not always, filled by a rabbi or hazzan in many congregations. In other congregations these roles are filled on an ad-hoc basis by members of the congregation who lead portions of services on a rotating basis:

Shaliach tzibur or Shatz (leader—literally ""agent"" or ""representative""—of the congregation) leads those assembled in prayer and sometimes prays on behalf of the community. When a shatz recites a prayer on behalf of the congregation, he is not acting as an intermediary but rather as a facilitator. The entire congregation participates in the recital of such prayers by saying amen at their conclusion; it is with this act that the shatz's prayer becomes the prayer of the congregation. Any adult capable of reciting the prayers clearly may act as shatz. In Orthodox congregations and some Conservative congregations, only men can be prayer leaders, but all Progressive communities now allow women to serve in this function.
The Baal kriyah or baal koreh (master of the reading) reads the weekly Torah portion. The requirements for being the baal kriyah are the same as those for the shatz. These roles are not mutually exclusive. The same person is often qualified to fill more than one role and often does. Often there are several people capable of filling these roles and different services (or parts of services) will be led by each.
Many congregations, especially larger ones, also rely on a:

Gabbai (sexton) – Calls people up to the Torah, appoints the shatz for each prayer session if there is no standard shatz, and makes certain that the synagogue is kept clean and supplied.
The three preceding positions are usually voluntary and considered an honour. Since the Enlightenment large synagogues have often adopted the practice of hiring rabbis and hazzans to act as shatz and baal kriyah, and this is still typically the case in many Conservative and Reform congregations. However, in most Orthodox synagogues these positions are filled by laypeople on a rotating or ad-hoc basis. Although most congregations hire one or more Rabbis, the use of a professional hazzan is generally declining in American congregations, and the use of professionals for other offices is rarer still.

Specialized religious roles
Dayan (judge) – An ordained rabbi with special legal training who belongs to a beth din (rabbinical court). In Israel, religious courts handle marriage and divorce cases, conversion and financial disputes in the Jewish community.
Mohel (circumciser) – An expert in the laws of circumcision who has received training from a previously qualified mohel and performs the brit milah (circumcision).
Shochet (ritual slaughterer) – In order for meat to be kosher, it must be slaughtered by a shochet who is an expert in the laws of kashrut and has been trained by another shochet.
Sofer (scribe) – Torah scrolls, tefillin (phylacteries), mezuzot (scrolls put on doorposts), and gittin (bills of divorce) must be written by a sofer who is an expert in Hebrew calligraphy and has undergone rigorous training in the laws of writing sacred texts.
Rosh yeshiva – A Torah scholar who runs a yeshiva.
Mashgiach/Mashgicha of a yeshiva – Depending on which yeshiva, might either be the person responsible for ensuring attendance and proper conduct, or even supervise the emotional and spiritual welfare of the students and give lectures on mussar (Jewish ethics).
Mashgiach/Mashgicha – Supervises manufacturers of kosher food, importers, caterers and restaurants to ensure that the food is kosher. Must be an expert in the laws of kashrut and trained by a rabbi, if not a rabbi himself or herself.

Historical Jewish groupings (to 1700)
Around the 1st century CE, there were several small Jewish sects: the Pharisees, Sadducees, Zealots, Essenes, and Christians. After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, these sects vanished. Christianity survived, but by breaking with Judaism and becoming a separate religion; the Pharisees survived but in the form of Rabbinic Judaism (today, known simply as ""Judaism""). The Sadducees rejected the divine inspiration of the Prophets and the Writings, relying only on the Torah as divinely inspired. Consequently, a number of other core tenets of the Pharisees' belief system (which became the basis for modern Judaism), were also dismissed by the Sadducees. (The Samaritans practiced a similar religion, which is traditionally considered separate from Judaism.)
Like the Sadducees who relied only on the Torah, some Jews in the 8th and 9th centuries rejected the authority and divine inspiration of the oral law as recorded in the Mishnah (and developed by later rabbis in the two Talmuds), relying instead only upon the Tanakh. These included the Isunians, the Yudganites, the Malikites, and others. They soon developed oral traditions of their own, which differed from the rabbinic traditions, and eventually formed the Karaite sect. Karaites exist in small numbers today, mostly living in Israel. Rabbinical and Karaite Jews each hold that the others are Jews, but that the other faith is erroneous.
Over a long time, Jews formed distinct ethnic groups in several different geographic areas—amongst others, the Ashkenazi Jews (of central and Eastern Europe), the Sephardi Jews (of Spain, Portugal, and North Africa), the Beta Israel of Ethiopia, the Yemenite Jews from the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula and the Malabari and Cochin Jews from Kerala . Many of these groups have developed differences in their prayers, traditions and accepted canons; however, these distinctions are mainly the result of their being formed at some cultural distance from normative (rabbinic) Judaism, rather than based on any doctrinal dispute.

Persecutions
Antisemitism arose during the Middle Ages, in the form of persecutions, pogroms, forced conversions, expulsions, social restrictions and ghettoization.
This was different in quality from the repressions of Jews which had occurred in ancient times. Ancient repressions were politically motivated and Jews were treated the same as members of other ethnic groups. With the rise of the Churches, the main motive for attacks on Jews changed from politics to religion and the religious motive for such attacks was specifically derived from Christian views about Jews and Judaism. During the Middle Ages, Jewish people who lived under Muslim rule generally experienced tolerance and integration, but there were occasional outbreaks of violence like Almohad's persecutions.

Hasidism
Hasidic Judaism was founded by Yisroel ben Eliezer (1700–1760), also known as the Ba'al Shem Tov (or Besht). It originated in a time of persecution of the Jewish people when European Jews had turned inward to Talmud study; many felt that most expressions of Jewish life had become too ""academic"", and that they no longer had any emphasis on spirituality or joy. Its adherents favoured small and informal gatherings called Shtiebel, which, in contrast to a traditional synagogue, could be used both as a place of worship and for celebrations involving dancing, eating, and socializing. Ba'al Shem Tov's disciples attracted many followers; they themselves established numerous Hasidic sects across Europe. Unlike other religions, which typically expanded through word of mouth or by use of print, Hasidism spread largely owing to Tzadiks, who used their influence to encourage others to follow the movement. Hasidism appealed to many Europeans because it was easy to learn, did not require full immediate commitment, and presented a compelling spectacle. Hasidic Judaism eventually became the way of life for many Jews in Eastern Europe. Waves of Jewish immigration in the 1880s carried it to the United States. The movement itself claims to be nothing new, but a refreshment of original Judaism. As some have put it: ""they merely re-emphasized that which the generations had lost"". Nevertheless, early on there was a serious schism between Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews. European Jews who rejected the Hasidic movement were dubbed by the Hasidim as Misnagdim, (lit. 'opponents'). Some of the reasons for the rejection of Hasidic Judaism were the exuberance of Hasidic worship, its deviation from tradition in ascribing infallibility and miracles to their leaders, and the concern that it might become a messianic sect. Over time differences between the Hasidim and their opponents have slowly diminished and both groups are now considered part of Haredi Judaism.

The Enlightenment and new religious movements
In the late 18th century CE, Europe was swept by a group of intellectual, social and political movements known as the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment led to reductions in the European laws that prohibited Jews to interact with the wider secular world, thus allowing Jews access to secular education and experience. A parallel Jewish movement, Haskalah or the ""Jewish Enlightenment"", began, especially in Central Europe and Western Europe, in response to both the Enlightenment and these new freedoms. It placed an emphasis on integration with secular society and a pursuit of non-religious knowledge through reason. With the promise of political emancipation, many Jews saw no reason to continue to observe halakha and increasing numbers of Jews assimilated into Christian Europe. Modern religious movements of Judaism all formed in reaction to this trend.
In Central Europe, followed by Great Britain and the United States, Reform (or Liberal) Judaism developed, relaxing legal obligations (especially those that limited Jewish relations with non-Jews), emulating Protestant decorum in prayer, and emphasizing the ethical values of Judaism's Prophetic tradition. Modern Orthodox Judaism developed in reaction to Reform Judaism, by leaders who argued that Jews could participate in public life as citizens equal to Christians while maintaining the observance of halakha. Meanwhile, in the United States, wealthy Reform Jews helped European scholars, who were Orthodox in practice but critical (and skeptical) in their study of the Bible and Talmud, to establish a seminary to train rabbis for immigrants from Eastern Europe. These left-wing Orthodox rabbis were joined by right-wing Reform rabbis who felt that halakha should not be entirely abandoned, to form the Conservative movement. Orthodox Jews who opposed the Haskalah formed Haredi Orthodox Judaism. After massive movements of Jews following The Holocaust and the creation of the state of Israel, these movements have competed for followers from among traditional Jews in or from other countries.

Spectrum of observance
Jewish religious practice varies widely through all levels of observance. According to the 2001 edition of the National Jewish Population Survey, in the United States' Jewish community—the world's second largest—4.3 million Jews out of 5.1 million had some sort of connection to the religion. Of that population of connected Jews, 80% participated in some sort of Jewish religious observance, but only 48% belonged to a congregation, and fewer than 16% attend regularly.

Judaism and other religions
Christianity and Judaism
Christianity was originally a sect of Second Temple Judaism, but the two religions diverged in the first century. The differences between Christianity and Judaism originally centered on whether Jesus was the Jewish Messiah but eventually became irreconcilable. Major differences between the two faiths include the nature of the Messiah, of atonement and sin, the status of God's commandments to Israel, and perhaps most significantly of the nature of God himself. Due to these differences, Judaism traditionally regards Christianity as Shituf or worship of the God of Israel which is not monotheistic. Christianity has traditionally regarded Judaism as obsolete with the invention of Christianity and Jews as a people replaced by the Church, though a Christian belief in dual-covenant theology emerged as a phenomenon following Christian reflection on how their theology influenced the Nazi Holocaust.

Since the time of the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church upheld the Constitutio pro Judæis (Formal Statement on the Jews), which stated: We decree that no Christian shall use violence to force them to be baptized, so long as they are unwilling and refuse.…Without the judgment of the political authority of the land, no Christian shall presume to wound them or kill them or rob them of their money or change the good customs that they have thus far enjoyed in the place where they live.""
Until their emancipation in the late 18th and the 19th century, Jews in Christian lands were subject to humiliating legal restrictions and limitations. They included provisions requiring Jews to wear specific and identifying clothing such as the Jewish hat and the yellow badge, restricting Jews to certain cities and towns or in certain parts of towns (ghettos), and forbidding Jews to enter certain trades (for example selling new clothes in medieval Sweden). Disabilities also included special taxes levied on Jews, exclusion from public life, restraints on the performance of religious ceremonies, and linguistic censorship. Some countries went even further and completely expelled Jews, for example, England in 1290 (Jews were readmitted in 1655) and Spain in 1492 (readmitted in 1868). The first Jewish settlers in North America arrived in the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam in 1654; they were forbidden to hold public office, open a retail shop, or establish a synagogue. When the colony was seized by the British in 1664 Jewish rights remained unchanged, but by 1671 Asser Levy was the first Jew to serve on a jury in North America. In 1791, Revolutionary France was the first country to abolish disabilities altogether, followed by Prussia in 1848. Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom was achieved in 1858 after an almost 30-year struggle championed by Isaac Lyon Goldsmid with the ability of Jews to sit in parliament with the passing of the Jews Relief Act 1858. The newly created German Empire in 1871 abolished Jewish disabilities in Germany, which were reinstated in the Nuremberg Laws in 1935.
Jewish life in Christian lands was marked by frequent blood libels, expulsions, forced conversions and massacres. Religious prejudice was an underlying source against Jews in Europe. Christian rhetoric and antipathy towards Jews developed in the early years of Christianity and was reinforced by ever increasing anti-Jewish measures over the ensuing centuries. The action taken by Christians against Jews included acts of violence, and murder culminating in the Holocaust.: 21 : 169  These attitudes were reinforced by Christian preaching, in art and popular teaching for two millennia which expressed contempt for Jews, as well as statutes which were designed to humiliate and stigmatise Jews. The Nazi Party was known for its persecution of Christian Churches; many of them, such as the Protestant Confessing Church and the Catholic Church, as well as Quakers and Jehovah's Witnesses, aided and rescued Jews who were being targeted by the antireligious régime.
The attitude of Christians and Christian Churches toward the Jewish people and Judaism have changed in a mostly positive direction since World War II. Pope John Paul II and the Catholic Church have ""upheld the Church's acceptance of the continuing and permanent election of the Jewish people"" as well as a reaffirmation of the covenant between God and the Jews. In December 2015, the Vatican released a 10,000-word document that, among other things, stated that Catholics should work with Jews to fight antisemitism.

Islam and Judaism
Both Judaism and Islam track their origins from the patriarch Abraham, and they are therefore considered Abrahamic religions. In both Jewish and Muslim tradition, the Jewish and Arab peoples are descended from the two sons of Abraham—Isaac and Ishmael, respectively. While both religions are monotheistic and share many commonalities, they differ based on the fact that Jews do not consider Jesus or Muhammad to be prophets. The religions' adherents have interacted with each other since the 7th century, when Islam originated and spread in the Arabian peninsula. The period under the Ummayad and the Abbasid caliphates between 712 and 1066 has been called the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain. Non-Muslim monotheists living in these countries, including Jews, were known as dhimmis. Dhimmis were allowed to practice their own religions and administer their own internal affairs, but they were subject to certain restrictions that were not imposed on Muslims. For example, they had to pay the jizya, a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males, and they were also forbidden to bear arms or testify in court cases involving Muslims. Many of the laws regarding dhimmis were highly symbolic. For example, dhimmis in some countries were required to wear distinctive clothing, a practice not found in either the Quran or the hadiths but invented in early medieval Baghdad and inconsistently enforced. Jews in Muslim countries were not entirely free from persecution—for example, many were killed, exiled or forcibly converted in the 12th century, in Persia, and by the rulers of the Almohad dynasty in North Africa and Al-Andalus, as well as by the Zaydi imams of Yemen in the 17th century (see Mawza Exile). At times, Jews were also restricted in their choice of residence—in Morocco, for example, Jews were confined to walled quarters (mellahs) beginning in the 15th century and increasingly since the early 19th century.
In the mid-20th century, Jews were expelled from nearly all of the Arab countries. Most have chosen to live in Israel. Today, antisemitic themes including Holocaust denial have become commonplace in the propaganda of Islamic movements such as Hizbullah and Hamas, in the pronouncements of various agencies of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and even in the newspapers and other publications of Refah Partisi.

Syncretic movements incorporating Judaism
There are some movements in other religions that include elements of Judaism. Among Christianity these are a number of denominations of ancient and contemporary Judaizers. The most well-known of these is Messianic Judaism, a religious movement, which arose in the 1960s, In this, elements of the messianic traditions in Judaism, are incorporated in, and melded with the tenets of Christianity. The movement generally states that Jesus is the Jewish Messiah, that he is one of the Three Divine Persons, and that salvation is only achieved through acceptance of Jesus as one's savior. Some members of Messianic Judaism argue that it is a sect of Judaism. Jewish organizations of every denomination reject this, stating that Messianic Judaism is a Christian sect, because it teaches creeds which are identical to those of Pauline Christianity, and because the conditions for Messiah to have come accordingly within traditional Jewish thought have not yet been met. Another religious movement is the Black Hebrew Israelite group, which not to be confused with less syncretic Black Judaism (a constellation of movements which, depending on their adherence to normative Jewish tradition, receive varying degrees of recognition by the broader Jewish community).
Other examples of syncretism include Semitic neopaganism, loosely organized sects which incorporate pagan, Goddess movement or Wiccan beliefs with some Jewish religious practices; Jewish Buddhists, another loosely organized group that incorporates elements of Buddhism and other Asian spirituality in their faith.
Some Renewal Jews borrow freely and openly from Buddhism, Sufism, Native American religions, and other faiths.
The Kabbalah Centre, which employs teachers from multiple religions, is a one of ""New Age Judaism"" movements that claims to popularize the kabbalah, part of the Jewish esoteric tradition.

Criticism
Criticism of Judaism may include those that require revisionism to classical Orthodox Judaism, such as that of the modernized denomination of Reconstructionist Judaism as established by American rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, who believed that classical Orthodox Judaism is outdated as a religious belief on its own, and should represent the Jewish culture as a progressive civilization.
On the other hand, proponents of classical Orthodox Judaism such as Neturei Karta and similar groups strongly oppose the growing accommodation to political Zionism by Haredi Jewish groups such as Agudat Yisrael; a previously anti-Zionist proponent of Orthodox Haredi Judaism whom the Neturei Karta see as betrayal by the Agudat Yisrael against the Orthodoxy, in the belief that Judaism should never be conflated with the politics of Zionism.
Orthodox Jewish public intellectual and polymath Yeshayahu Leibowitz believed in the separation of church and state, and regarded Reform Judaism as a ""historical distortion of the Jewish religion"".

History
Historical overview
Islam in the United States can be traced back to the 16th century when African slaves were brought to the United States of America. Historians estimate that between 15% to 30% of the enslaved Africans were Muslim. Most slaves who tried to maintain Islamic religious practices after their arrival were forcibly converted to Christianity. Some enslaved Muslims managed to preserve their religious practices. In the mid-seventeenth century, Ottoman Muslims are documented to have immigrated with other European immigrants, such as Anthony Janszoon van Salee, a merchant of mixed origin from Morocco. Immigration drastically increased from 1878 to 1924 when Muslims from the Balkans, and Syria settled in modern-day Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota. During that era, the Ford Motor Company employed Muslims as well as African-Americans, since they were the most inclined to work in its factories under demanding conditions. By the 1930s and 1940s, Muslims in the US built mosques for their communal religious observance. As of the early 21st century, the number of Muslims in the United States is estimated at 3.5 to 4.5 million, and Islam is predicted to eventually become the second-largest religion in the US.

Early records
One of the earliest accounts of Islam's possible presence in North America dates to 1528, when a Moroccan slave, called Mustafa Azemmouri, was shipwrecked near what is now Galveston, Texas. He and three Spanish survivors subsequently traveled through much of the American southwest and the Mexican interior before reaching Mexico City.
Historian Peter Manseau wrote:

Muslims' presence [in the United States] is affirmed in documents dated more than a century before religious liberty became the law of the land, as in a Virginia statute of 1682 which referred to ""negroes, moores, molatoes, and others, born of and in heathenish, idolatrous, pagan, and Mahometan parentage and country"" who ""heretofore and hereafter may be purchased, procured, or otherwise obtained, as slaves.""

American Revolution and thereafter
Records from the American Revolutionary War indicate that at least a few likely Muslims fought on the American side. Among the recorded names of American soldiers are ""Yusuf ben Ali"" (a member of the Turks of South Carolina community), ""Bampett Muhamed"" and possibly Peter Salem.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		

The first country to recognize the United States as an independent nation was the Sultanate of Morocco, under its ruler Mohammed ben Abdallah, in the year 1777. He maintained several correspondences with President George Washington. On December 9, 1805, President Thomas Jefferson hosted a dinner at the White House for his guest Sidi Soliman Mellimelli, an envoy from Tunis.
Bilali ""Ben Ali"" Muhammad was a Fula Muslim from Timbo, Futa-Jallon, in present-day Guinea-Conakry, who arrived at Sapelo Island during 1803. While enslaved, he became the religious leader and Imam for a slave community numbering approximately eighty Muslim men residing on his plantation. During the War of 1812, Muhammad and the eighty Muslim men under his leadership protected their master's Sapelo Island property from a British attack. He is known to have fasted during the month of Ramadan, worn a fez and kaftan, and observed the Muslim feasts, in addition to consistently performing the five obligatory prayers. In 1829, Bilali authored a thirteen-page Arabic Risala on Islamic beliefs and the rules for ablution, morning prayer, and the calls to prayer. Known as the Bilali Document, it is currently housed at the University of Georgia in Athens.

Nineteenth century
On the morning of April 5, 1865, near the end of the American Civil War, Union troops commanded by Col. Thomas M. Johnston set ablaze the University of Alabama; a copy of the Quran known as The Koran: Commonly Called The Alcoran was saved by one of the university's staff.
Estimates ranging from a dozen to two hundred and ninety-two Muslims served in the Union military during the American Civil War, including Private Mohammed Kahn, who was born in Persia, raised in Afghanistan, and emigrated to the United States. The highest-ranking Muslim officer in the Union Army was Captain Moses Osman. Nicholas Said (born 1836), formerly enslaved to an Arab master, came to the United States in 1860 and found a teaching job in Detroit. In 1863, Said enlisted in the 55th Massachusetts Colored Regiment in the United States Army and rose to the rank of sergeant. He was later granted a transfer to a military hospital, where he gained some knowledge of medicine. His Army records state that he died in Brownsville, Tennessee, in 1882. Another Muslim soldier from the Civil War was Max Hassan, an African who worked for the military as a porter.

A Greek/Syrian convert to Islam, Phillip Tedro (a name he reverted to later in life), born in Smyrna, who renamed himself Hajj Ali, 'Ali who made the pilgrimage to Mecca,' (commonly spelled as ""Hi Jolly"") was hired by the United States Cavalry in 1856 to tend camels in Arizona and California. He would later become a prospector in Arizona. Hajj Ali died in 1903.
During the American Civil War, the ""scorched earth"" policy of the North destroyed churches, farms, schools, libraries, colleges, and a great deal of other property. The libraries at the University of Alabama managed to save one book from the debris of their library buildings. On the morning of April 4, 1865, when Federal troops reached the campus with an order to destroy the university, Andre Deloffre, a modern language professor and custodian of the library, appealed to the commanding officer to spare one of the finest libraries in the South. The officer, being sympathetic, sent a courier to Brigadier General John T. Croxton at his headquarters in Tuscaloosa, Alabama asking permission to save the Rotunda, but the general refused to allow this. The officer reportedly said, ""I will save one volume as a memento of this occasion."" The volume selected was a rare copy of the Qur'an.
Alexander Russell Webb is considered by historians to be the earliest prominent Anglo-American convert to Islam in 1888. In 1893, he was the sole representative of Islam at the first Parliament of the World's Religions. The Russian-born Muslim scholar and writer Achmed Abdullah (1881–1945) was another prominent early American Muslim.
In the 1891 Supreme Court case In re Ross, the Court referred to “the intense hostility of the people of Muslim faith to all other sects, and particularly to Christians"". Scores of Muslim immigrants were turned away at U.S. ports in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Christian immigrants suspected of secretly being Muslims were also excluded.

Slaves
Many enslaved people brought to America from Africa were Muslims from the predominantly-Muslim West African region. Between 1701 and 1800, some 500,000 Africans arrived in what became the United States. Historians estimate that between 15 and 30 percent of all enslaved African men and less than 15 percent of the enslaved African women were Muslims. According to 21st century researchers Donna Meigs-Jaques and R. Kevin Jaques, ""[t]hese enslaved Muslims stood out from their compatriots because of their resistance, determination and education.""
It is estimated that over 50% of the slaves imported to North America came from areas where Islam was followed by at least a minority population. Thus, no less than 200,000 came from regions influenced by Islam. Substantial numbers originated from Senegambia, a region with an established community of Muslim inhabitants extending to the 11th century.
Through a series of conflicts, primarily with the Fulani jihad states, about half of the Senegambian Mandinka were converted to Islam, while as many as a third were sold into slavery to the Americas through capture in conflict.
Michael A. Gomez speculated that Muslim slaves may have accounted for ""thousands, if not tens of thousands"", but does not offer a precise estimate. He also suggests many non-Muslim slaves were acquainted with some tenets of Islam, due to Muslim trading and proselytizing activities.
Historical records indicate many enslaved Muslims conversed in the Arabic language. Some even composed literature (such as autobiographies) and commentaries on the Quran.
Some newly arrived Muslim slaves assembled for communal salat (prayers). Some were provided a private praying area by their owner. The two best documented Muslim slaves were Ayuba Suleiman Diallo and Omar Ibn Said. Suleiman was brought to America in 1731 and returned to Africa in 1734. Like many Muslim slaves, he often encountered impediments when attempting to perform religious rituals and was eventually allotted a private location for prayer by his master.
Omar ibn Said (c. 1770–1864) is among the best documented examples of a practicing-Muslim slave. He lived on a 19th Century North Carolina plantation and wrote many Arabic texts while enslaved. Born in the kingdom of Futa Tooro (modern Senegal), he arrived in America in 1807, one month before the U.S. abolished importation of slaves. Some of his works include the Lords Prayer, the Bismillah, this is How You Pray, Quranic phases, the 23rd Psalm, and an autobiography. In 1857, he produced his last known writing on Surah 110 of the Quran. In 1819, Omar received an Arabic translation of the Christian Bible from his master, James Owen. Omar converted to Christianity in 1820, an episode widely used throughout the South to ""prove"" the benevolence of slavery. However, many scholars believe he continued to be a practicing Muslim, based on dedications to Muhammad written in his Bible.

Religious freedom
Views of Islam in America affected debates regarding freedom of religion during the drafting of the state constitution of Pennsylvania in 1776. Constitutionalists promoted religious toleration while Anti-constitutionalists called for reliance on Protestant values in the formation of the state's republican government. The former group won out and inserted a clause for religious liberty in the new state constitution. American views of Islam were influenced by favorable Enlightenment writings from Europe, as well as Europeans who had long warned that Islam was a threat to Christianity and republicanism.
In 1776, John Adams published ""Thoughts on Government"", in which he mentions the Islamic prophet Muhammad as a ""sober inquirer after truth"" alongside Confucius, Zoroaster, Socrates, and other thinkers.
In 1785, George Washington stated a willingness to hire ""Mahometans"", as well as people of any nation or religion, to work on his private estate at Mount Vernon if they were ""good workmen"".
In 1790, the South Carolina legislative body granted special legal status to a community of Moroccans.
In 1797, President John Adams signed the Treaty of Tripoli, declaring the United States had no ""character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquillity, of Mussulmen"".

In his autobiography, published in 1791, Benjamin Franklin stated that he ""did not disapprove"" of a meeting place in Pennsylvania that was designed to accommodate preachers of all religions. Franklin wrote that ""even if the Mufti of Constantinople were to send a missionary to preach Mohammedanism to us, he would find a pulpit at his service"".
President Thomas Jefferson defended religious freedom in America, including those of Muslims. Jefferson explicitly mentioned Muslims when writing about the movement for religious freedom in Virginia. In his autobiography Jefferson wrote ""[When] the [Virginia] bill for establishing religious freedom ... was finally passed, ... a singular proposition proved that its protection of opinion was meant to be universal. Where the preamble declares that coercion is a departure from the plan of the holy author of our religion, an amendment was proposed, by inserting the word 'Jesus Christ', so that it should read 'a departure from the plan of Jesus Christ, the holy author of our religion'. The insertion was rejected by a great majority, in proof that they meant to comprehend within the mantle of its protection the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and Mahometan, the Hindoo and infidel of every denomination."" While President, Jefferson also participated in an iftar with the Ambassador of Tunisia in 1809.
However, not all politicians were pleased with the religious neutrality of the Constitution, which prohibited any religious test. Anti-Federalists in the 1788 North Carolina ratifying convention opposed the new constitution; one reason was the fear that some day Catholics or Muslims might be elected president. William Lancaster said:

Let us remember that we form a government for millions not yet in existence ... In the course of four or five hundred years, I do not know how it will work. This is most certain, that Papists may occupy that chair, and Mahometans may take it. I see nothing against it.
In 1788, Americans held inaccurate, and often contradicting, views of the Muslim world, and used that in political arguments. For example, the anti-Federalists compared a strong central government to the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and the American army to Turkish Janissaries, arguing against a strong central government. On the other hand, Alexander Hamilton argued that despotism in the Middle East was the result of the Sultan not having enough power to protect his people from oppressive local governors; thus he argued for a stronger central government.

20th century
Modern Muslims
Small-scale migration to the U.S. by Muslims began in 1840, with the arrival of Yemenis and Turks, and lasted until World War I. Most of the immigrants, from Arab areas of the Ottoman Empire, came with the purpose of making money and returning to their homeland. However, the economic hardships of 19th-century America prevented them from prospering, and as a result the immigrants settled in the United States permanently. These immigrants settled primarily in Dearborn, Michigan; Paterson, New Jersey; Quincy, Massachusetts; and Ross, North Dakota. Ross, North Dakota is the site of the first documented mosque and Muslim Cemetery, but it was abandoned and later torn down in the mid-1970s. A new mosque was built in its place in 2005. Construction of mosques sped up in the 1920s and 1930s, and by 1952, there were over 20 mosques. Although the first mosque was established in the U.S. in 1915, relatively few mosques were founded before the 1960s.

1893: Alexander Russell Webb starts the first Islamic Mission in the United States called the American Muslim Propagation Movement.
1906: Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) in Chicago, Illinois, started the Džemijetul Hajrije (Jamaat al-Khayriyya) (The Benevolent Society; a social service organization devoted to Bosnian Muslims). This is the longest lasting incorporated Muslim community in the United States. They met in Bosnian coffeehouses and eventually opened the first Islamic Sunday School with curriculum and textbooks under Bosnian scholar Sheikh Kamil Avdich (Ćamil Avdić) (a graduate of al-Azhar and author of Survey of Islamic Doctrines).
1907: Lipka Tatar immigrants from the Podlasie region of Poland founded the first Muslim organization in New York City, the American Mohammedan Society which became the Powers Street Mosque. In 2017 they celebrated the 110 anniversary of their establishment.
1915: What is most likely the first American mosque was founded by Albanian Muslims in Biddeford, Maine. A Muslim cemetery still exists there.
1920: The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community was established by the arrival of Mufti Muhammad Sadiq, an Indian Ahmadi Muslim missionary, he later purchased a building in south Chicago and converted it to what is today known as the Al-Sadiq Mosque which was rebuilt as purpose-built mosque in 1990s.
1921: The Highland Park Mosque was built in Highland Park, Michigan, although closed a few years later.
1929: The Ross Masjid in North Dakota was founded by Syrian Muslims, there is still a cemetery nearby.
1934: The oldest continuously and still standing building built specifically to be a mosque was established in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The mosque is where Abdullah Igram a notable Muslim veteran would teach the Quran, Abdullah Igram later wrote a letter to President Eisenhower persuading him to add the M option (for Muslims) on military dog tags.
1935: The statue of Mohammed was drawn on the north wall of the US Supreme Court building in 1935. Also, statues of Charlemagne and Justinian as one of eighteen great law givers of history are seen around the statue of Mohammed.
1945: A mosque existed in Dearborn, Michigan, home to the largest Arab-American population in the U.S.
""Since the 1950s,"" many notable political activists and socialites with influence over politicians have come from the American Muslim community.
The Muslim population of the U.S. increased dramatically after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 into law. The act abolished former immigration quotas, and expanded immigration opportunities from countries with significant Muslim populations.
The Xoraxaya, Muslim Roma from Northern Macedonia, also came to the USA, where they founded mainly in the Bronx two Mosques.
Approximately 2.78 million people immigrated to the United States from countries with significant Muslim populations between 1966 and 1997, with some estimating 1.1 million people of that population being Muslims. One-third of those immigrants originated from North Africa or the Middle East, one-third originated from South Asian countries, with the remaining third originating from across the entire world. Immigration to the United States post-1965 favored those deemed to have specialized educational and skills, thus impacting the socio-economic makeup of American Muslims. The United States began seeing Muslim immigrants arrive in the late 20th century as refugees due to such reasons as political unrest, war, and famine.

Subgroups of Muslim Americans
According to the Pew Research Center, approximately 55% of Muslims in the United States are Sunni Muslims, with Shia Muslims representing roughly 16% of the American Muslim population of which there are also sub-sects within the Shia Muslim denomination such as Nizar'i Ismailism, Bohras, etc.  The remainder identify with neither group, including some who consider themselves to be non-denominational Muslims.

Black Muslim movements
During the first half of the 20th century, several groups based on Islamic and Gnostic teachings combined with pseudohistorical colonial beliefs were established by African Americans.

Moorish Science Temple of America
The Moorish Science Temple of America is an American organization founded in 1913 by Noble Drew Ali, making it the oldest Islamic organization in the United States. Drew taught that black people were of Moorish origin but their Muslim identity was taken away through slavery and racial segregation, advocating the return to Islam of their Moorish ancestry. The founder stated that the organization practiced the ""Old Time Religion"" of Islamism, but he also drew inspiration from Mohammedanism, Buddhism, Christianity, Gnosticism, and Taoism. Its significant divergences from mainstream Islam make its classification as an Islamic denomination a matter of debate among Muslims and scholars of religion.
Its primary tenet was the belief that they are the ancient Moabites who inhabited the Northwestern and Southwestern shores of Africa. The organization also believes that their descendants after being conquered in Spain are slaves who were captured and held in slavery from 1779 to 1865 by their slaveholders.
Adherents of the Moorish Science Temple of America believe that the so-called ""Asiatics"" were the first human inhabitant of the Western Hemisphere. In their religious texts members refer to themselves as ""Asiatics"", within the teachings of Noble Drew Ali, the members are taught man cannot be a Negro, Colored Folk, Black people, Ethiopians, because these names were given to slaves by slave holders in 1779 and lasted until 1865 during the time of slavery.
The Moorish Science Temple of America's current leader is R. Jones-Bey.

Nation of Islam
The Nation of Islam (NOI) was created in 1930 by Wallace Fard Muhammad. Fard drew inspiration for NOI doctrines from those of Timothy Drew's Moorish Science Temple of America. He provided three main principles which serve as the foundation of the NOI: ""Allah is God, the white man is the devil and the so-called Negroes are the Asiatic Black People, the cream of the planet earth"".
In 1934, Elijah Muhammad became the leader of the NOI, he deified Fard, saying that he was an incarnation of God, and taught that he was a prophet who had been taught directly by God in the form of Fard. Two of the most famous people to join the NOI were Malcolm X, who became the face of the NOI in the media, and Muhammad Ali, who, while initially rejected, was accepted into the group shortly after his first world heavyweight championship victory. Both Malcolm X and Ali later became Sunni Muslims.
Malcolm X was one of the most influential leaders of the NOI and, in accordance with NOI doctrine, advocated the complete separation of blacks from whites. He left the NOI after being silenced for 90 days (due to a controversial comment on the John F. Kennedy assassination), and proceeded to form Muslim Mosque, Inc. and the Organization of Afro-American Unity before his pilgrimage to Mecca and conversion to Sunni Islam. He is viewed as the first person to start the movement among African-Americans towards Sunni Islam.
It was estimated that there were at least 20,000 members in 2006. However, today the group has a wide influence in the African-American community. The first Million Man March took place in Washington, D.C. in 1995 and was followed later by another one in 2000 which was smaller in size but more inclusive, welcoming individuals other than just African-American men. The group sponsors cultural and academic education, economic independence, and personal and social responsibility.
The Nation of Islam has received a great deal of criticism for its anti-white, anti-Christian, and anti-semitic teachings, and is listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Five-Percent Nation
The Five-Percent Nation, sometimes referred to as NGE or NOGE, the Nation of Gods and Earths, or the Five Percenters, is an American organization founded in 1964 in the Harlem section of the borough of Manhattan, New York City, by a former member of the Nation of Islam named Clarence 13X (born Clarence Edward Smith and later known as ""Allah the Father""). Clarence 13X, a former student of Malcolm X, left the Nation of Islam after a theological dispute with the Nation's leaders over the nature and identity of God. Specifically, Clarence 13X denied that the Nation's biracial founder Wallace Fard Muhammad was Allah and instead taught that the Black man was himself God personified.
Members of the group call themselves Allah's Five Percenters, which reflects the concept that ten percent of the people in the world know the truth of existence, and those elites and agents opt to keep eighty-five percent of the world in ignorance and under their controlling thumb; the remaining five percent are those who know the truth and are determined to enlighten the rest.

United Nation of Islam
The United Nation of Islam (UNOI) is a group based in Kansas City, Kansas. It was founded circa 1978 by Royall Jenkins, who continues to be the leader of the group and styles himself ""Royall, Allah in Person"".

Conversion to orthodox Sunni Islam
After the death of Elijah Muhammad, he was succeeded by his son, Warith Deen Mohammed. Mohammed rejected many teachings of his father, such as the divinity of Fard Muhammad, and saw a white person as also a worshiper. As he took control of the organization, he quickly brought in new reforms. He renamed it the World Community of al-Islam in the West; later it became the American Society of Muslims. It was estimated that there were 200,000 followers of W. D. Mohammed at the time.
W. D. Mohammed introduced teachings which were based on orthodox Sunni Islam. He removed the chairs in the organization's temples, and replaced the entire ""temple"" concept with the traditional Muslim house of worship, the mosque, also teaching how to pray the salat, to observe the fasting of Ramadan, and to attend the pilgrimage to Mecca.
A small number of Black Muslims however rejected these new reforms brought by Imam Mohammed. Louis Farrakhan, who broke away from the organization, re-established the Nation of Islam under the original Fardian doctrines, and remains its leader.

Shia Islam
An estimated 386,000 to 900,000 Shia Muslims live in the United States. They originate from South Asia, Europe, Middle East, and East Africa; and are often from the countries of: Islamic Republic of Pakistan, India, Islamic Republic of Iran, Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen and East Africa; Shiites in the United States also make up about 16 percent of the country's total Muslim population.The ""heart of Shiism in the U.S."" is placed in Dearborn, home to the Islamic Center of America. The North American Shia Ithna-Asheri (Twelver Shi'ism) Muslim Communities Organization (NASIMCO) is the largest umbrella group for North American Shias.

Sufism
Some Muslim Americans adhere to the doctrines of Sufism. The Islamic Supreme Council of America (ISCA) is a small body representing Sufi teachings, which, according to adherents, is the inner, mystical dimension of Islam. The ISCA's stated aims include providing practical solutions for American Muslims, based on the traditional Islamic legal rulings of an international advisory board, many of whom are recognized as the highest-ranking Islamic scholars in the world. ISCA aims to integrate traditional scholarship in resolving contemporary issues affecting the maintenance of Islamic beliefs in a modern, secular society. It has been linked to neo-traditionalist thought.

Quranic movement
The largest Quranist movement in the United States is the United Submitters International. This movement was founded by Rashad Khalifa. His movement popularized the phrase: ""The Qur'an, the whole Qur'an, and nothing but the Qur'an"". Although he was initially well received by many, his subsequent claims of divine inspiration caused friction between him and others, and he was assassinated in 1990. Notable Americans influenced by Rashad Khalifa include his son, Sam Khalifa, a retired professional baseball player, and Ahmad Rashad, a sportscaster and retired football player.

Non-denominational Muslims
Research by Pew in 2011 found that Non-denominational Muslims make up roughly one in seven of all American Muslims, at 15%. Non-denominational Muslims, do not have any specific affiliation with a religious body and usually describe themselves as being ""just a Muslim"". Muslims who were born in the US are more likely to be non-denominational than immigrant Muslims. 24% or one in four US-born Muslims are non-denominational, versus 10% of immigrant Muslims.

Ahmadiyya
The Ahmadiyya Community was established in 1920 in the United States. Ahmadi Muslims were among the earliest Muslim missionaries in America, the first being Mufti Muhammad Sadiq, who arrived in America on February 15, 1920, and between 1921 and 1925 alone they converted over 1000 people to Islam. Although at first their efforts were broadly concentrated over a large number of racial and ethnic groups, subsequent realization of the deep-seated racial tensions and discrimination made Ahmadi missionaries focus their attention on mainly African Americans and the Muslim immigrant community and became vocal proponents of the civil rights movement. Officially incorporated in Illinois in 1948 as the Ahmadiyya Movement In Islam, Inc. and commonly referred to as the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community since 2006(?). Many Ahmadi Muslims fled countries like Pakistan due to persecution in recent times.

Other Muslims
There are some mosquegoers who adhere to sects and denominations that form very small minorities. Examples of such small branches include progressive Muslims, Mahdavi Muslims, Ibadi Muslims, and Ismaili Muslims.

Conversion to Islam
Some of the earliest Islamic missionary activities were undertaken by Alexander Russell Webb, who in 1893 established a mission in Manhattan, although it faltered due to lack of funding. From 1910 to 1912, Inayat Khan toured major American cities preaching Islam; he attracted large audiences though not as many converts. More successful in converting Americans to Islam was Mufti Muhammad Sadiq, who established a mission in Chicago in 1920. The converts Sadiq attracted tended to be African American.: 31–32  Soon after, African-American Muslim groups began to form: the Moorish Science Temple was established in Chicago in 1925, and the Nation of Islam formed in 1930.: 34–36 
According to an article in 2001, 25,000 Americans convert to Islam per year.
In more recent years, there has been significant conversion to Islam in the state, federal, and local prisons of the United States. According to J. Michael Waller, Muslim inmates constitute 15–20% of the prison population, or roughly 350,000 inmates in 2003. Waller states that these inmates mostly come into prison as non-Muslims. He also says that 80% of the prisoners who ""find faith"" while in prison convert to Islam. These converted inmates are mostly African American, with a small but growing Hispanic minority.

Demographics
The U.S. Census Bureau does not collect data on religious identification. Various institutions and organizations have given widely varying estimates about the Muslim population in the U.S. Tom W. Smith, author of ""Estimating the Muslim Population in the United States"", said that of twenty estimates he reviewed during a five-year period until 2001, none was ""based on a scientifically-sound or explicit methodology. All can probably be characterized as guesses or assertions. Nine came from Muslim organizations such as the Islamic Society of North America, the Muslim Student Association, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the American Muslim Council, and the Harvard Islamic Society or unspecified 'Muslim sources'. None of these sources gave any basis for their figures."" In 2005, according to The New York Times, more people from Muslim-majority countries became legal permanent United States residents—nearly 96,000—than in any year in the previous two decades.
According to CAIR, no scientific count of Muslims in the U.S. has been done and the larger figures should be considered accurate. Some journalists have also alleged that the higher numbers have been inflated for political purposes.
According to the 2010 US Religion Census, there were estimated to be 2.6 million Muslims and over 2,000 Mosques in the US. According to a Pew Forum estimate, in 2017 there were 3.45 million Muslims, constituting about 1.1% of the total U.S. population, compared with 70.6% who follow Christianity, 22.8% unaffiliated, 1.9% Judaism, 0.7% Buddhism, and 0.7% Hinduism. A Pew Forum report on American religion found that Muslims accounted for 0.9% of American adults in 2014, up from 0.4% in 2007, due largely to immigration. Retention rates were high, at 77%, similar to Hindus (80%) and Jews (75%); most people who leave these religions become unaffiliated, although ex-Muslims were more likely to be Christians than ex-Hindus or ex-Jews were. Conversely, 23% of American Muslims were converts, including 8% from historically black Protestant traditions, 6% from being unaffiliated, 4% from Catholicism, and 3% from mainline or evangelical Protestantism. By race, in 2014, 38% were non-Hispanic white (including Arabs and Iranians, up from 32% in 2007), 28% were Asian (mostly Indians, Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis, up from 20% in 2007), 28% were black (down from 32%), 4% Hispanic (down from 7%), and 3% of mixed or other race (down from 7%). Since 2007, the black proportion had shrunk, while the white and Asian proportions had grown, mainly due to immigration as most black Muslims were native U.S. blacks.
On the other hand, according to data from the General Social Survey in the United States ""32% of those raised Muslim no longer embrace Islam in adulthood, and 18% hold no religious identification"". and according to Pew Research, the number of American converts to Islam is roughly equal to the number of American Muslims who leave the religion.

Race
According to a 2001 study written by Ihsan Bagby, an associate professor of Islamic studies at the University of Kentucky, of Americans who convert to Islam, 64% are African American, 27% are White, 6% are Hispanic of any race, and 3% are other. Around that time increasing numbers of American Hispanics converted to Islam. Many Hispanic converts in Houston said that they often had been mistaken as of being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern descent, due to their religion. Many Hispanic converts were former Christians.
Since the arrival of South Asian and Arab communities during the 1990s there has been divisions with the African Americans due to the racial and cultural differences; however, since September 11, 2001, the two groups joined when the immigrant communities looked towards the African Americans for advice on civil rights.

Religion
According to a 2014 religious survey, 64% of American Muslims believe religion is very important, compared to 58% of American Catholics who believe so. The frequency of receiving answers to prayers among Muslims was, 31% at least once a week and 12% once or twice a month. Nearly a quarter of the Muslims are converts to Islam (23%), mainly native-born. Of the total who have converted, 59% are African American and 34% white. Previous religions of those converted was Protestantism (67%), Roman Catholicism (10%), and 15% no religion.
Mosques are usually explicitly Sunni or Shia although there are over 55 Ahmadiyya mosques as well. There are 2,769 mosques in the United States as of 2020, and the nation's largest mosque, the Islamic Center of America, is in Dearborn, Michigan. It caters mainly to the Shia Muslim congregation; however, all Muslims may attend this mosque. It was rebuilt in 2005 to accommodate over 3,000 people for the increasing Muslim population in the region. More than half (55%) of the religious affiliations of Muslims is Sunni, 16% Shia, 22% non-affiliated and 16% other/non-response. Muslims of Arab descent are mostly Sunni (56%) with minorities who are Shia (19%). Muslims of South Asian descent including Bangladeshis (90%), Indians (82%) and Pakistanis (72%) are mainly Sunni, other groups such as Iranians are mainly Shia (91%). Of African American Muslims, 48% are Sunni, 34% are unaffiliated (mostly part of the Community of W. Deen Mohammed), 16% other (mostly Nation of Islam and Ahmadiyya) and 2% Shia.
In many areas, a mosque may be dominated by whatever group of immigrants is the largest. Sometimes the Friday sermons, or khutbas, are given in languages like Urdu, Bengali or Arabic along with English. Areas with large Muslim populations may support a number of mosques serving different immigrant groups or varieties of belief within Sunni or Shia traditions. At present, many mosques are served by imams who immigrate from overseas, as only these imams have certificates from Muslim seminaries.

Education and income
The household income levels of American Muslims are about as evenly distributed as the general American population.
When it comes to education, the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding reported in 2017 that across the board, American Muslims, Protestants, and Catholics have similar education levels. It has also been found that Muslim women (73%) are more likely than Muslim men (57%) to go on to pursue higher education beyond high school, and they are also more likely to report being in the middle class.
Current estimates show that there are 270 full-time Islamic schools that enrol between 26,000 and 35,500 students in the United States. Islamic k-12 schools typically teach tawhid, or belief that God is the creator and sustainer of the universe; ilm, the imperative to seek knowledge; and ta’lim, and specific teaching about the Qur’an and ahadith. Some private Islamic schools in the United States cater to specific ethnic and/or cultural communities. Others enrol students from diverse backgrounds and ethnicities. Specific subject that are taught include Arabic, Qur’an, and Islamic studies along with academic subjects such as math, science, English, history, civics, and in some schools, art and music. Typically Islamic schools integrate religious knowledge throughout the curricula, incorporate prayer into their daily schedules, require modest dress, and serve halal food.
Among South Asians in the country, the large Pakistani American community stands out as particularly well educated and prosperous, with education and income levels exceeding those of U.S.-born whites. Many are professionals, especially in medicine (they account for 2.7-5% of America's physicians), scientists, engineers, and financial analysts, and there are also a large number of entrepreneurs. There are more than 15,000 medical doctors practicing medicine in the USA who are of Pakistani origin alone and the number of Pakistani American millionaires was reported to be in the thousands. Shahid Khan is a Pakistani-born American multi billionaire businessmen and owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL) making him the first and only ethnic minority member to own one, he also owns English Premier League team Fulham F.C., and automobile parts manufacturer Flex-N-Gate in Urbana, Illinois.
45 percent of immigrant Muslims report annual household income levels of $50,000 or higher. This compares to the national average of 44 percent. Immigrant Muslims are well represented among higher-income earners, with 19 percent having annual household incomes of $100,000 or higher (compared to 16 percent for the Muslim population as a whole and 17 percent for the U.S. average). This is likely due to the strong concentration of Muslims in professional, managerial, and technical fields, especially in information technology, education, medicine, law, and the corporate world.

By state
There were estimated to be about 4.5 million Muslim adherents across the United States in 2020.

Population concentrations
Generally speaking, Muslims are concentrated in the Eastern one-third of the United States, and particularly in the Northeast megalopolis, given the region's relative proximity to the Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia, and South Asia by flight.
New York City had the largest number of Muslims in the US with approximately 75,000. In 2000, Dearborn, Michigan, ranked second with 29,181, and Los Angeles ranked third with 25,673; although Paterson, New Jersey, in the New York City Metropolitan Area, was estimated to have become home to 25,000 to 30,000 Muslims as of 2011. The Muslim population in the New York metropolitan area approximates 1.5 million, the largest metropolitan Muslim population in the Western hemisphere.
As of 2020, New York was the state home to the highest absolute number of Muslims, by a significant margin, at over 724,000. By percentages of the population, Illinois, the State of New York, New Jersey, and Maryland all hosted population concentrations greater than 3%. Paterson in New Jersey has been nicknamed Little Ramallah and Little Istanbul and contains a neighborhood with the same name, with an Arab American population estimated as high as 20,000 in 2015. Philadelphia was estimated to have 30,000 to 50,000 Muslims as of 2012. Houston was estimated to have 63,000 Muslims as of 2012.

Mosques
In 2020, the US Mosque Survey identified 2,796 Islamic places of worship in the United States, a ""31% increase from the 2010 count."" The U.S. states with the highest number of mosques were New York (343), California (304), Texas (224), Florida (157), and New Jersey (141), with New York gaining the highest number of mosques compared to 2011 (86 additional). As part of a sampled survey, the US Mosque Survey reports that 6% of mosques self identified as Shi'ite. Pew Research Center notes that 61% of respondents to the survey ""say that women have served on the board at some point in the last five years.""
Previously, in 2011, the number of mosques in the United States was 2,106. At the time, the six states with the highest numbers of mosques were: New York (257), California (246), Texas (166), Florida (118), Illinois (109), and New Jersey (109).
In the United States in particular, it has been shown in a study done by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding that Muslim Americans who regularly attend mosques are more likely to work with their neighbors to solve community problems (49 vs. 30 percent), be registered to vote (74 vs. 49 percent), and plan to vote (92 vs. 81 percent). The study also states that “there is no correlation between Muslim attitudes toward violence and their frequency of mosque attendance.”
Regarding mosque attendance, data shows that American Muslim women and American Muslim men attend the mosque at similar rates (45% for men and 35% for women). Additionally, when compared to the general public looking at the attendance of religious services, young Muslim Americans attend the mosque at closer rates to older Muslim Americans. A Pew Research study found that women attendance at American mosques increased from 2011 to 2020, as did women participation in mosque administration, including positions on the board of trustees.

Culture
Within the Muslim community in the United States there exist a number of different traditions. As in the rest of the world, the Sunni Muslims are in the majority. Shia Muslims, especially those in the Iranian immigrant community, are also active in community affairs. All four major schools of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) are found among the Sunni community.
Muslims in the United States have increasingly made their own culture; there are various Muslim comedy groups, rap groups, Scout troops and magazines, and Muslims have been vocal in other forms of media as well.
Hijab is commonly worn by Muslim women in the United States, and is a very distinctive cultural feature of Muslims in America. According to a Pew Research Center poll from 2011, 36% of Muslim American women reported wearing hijab whenever they were in public, with an additional 24% indicating they wore it most or some of the time, while only 40% indicated that they never wore the headcover. Contrary to popular beliefs about assimilation, the study found that the number of women wearing hijab was in fact higher among native-born Muslim women compared to first-generation Muslim immigrants. In the 1990s, however, hijabs were not commonly seen in the United States, as overt Islamization became more apparent only during the 21st century. Compared to some nations in Western Europe, such as France and the Netherlands, there have been relatively few controversies surrounding the hijab in everyday life, a product of ""pro-religious freedom"" laws allowing for a wide range of religious accommodations, and also due to greater support for multiculturalism.
In his 2008 book Al' America, writer and journalist Jonathan Curiel wrote about the consequences of 9/11 on the perception of Islamic culture in America, stating that it has been difficult for some Americans to ""see Arab and Muslim culture as anything other than terrorism and fundamentalism"". The Islamic experience in the US is also not well known or researched among mainstream society, with Jewish scholar Lior Sternfeld stating, ""Muslim-Americans were a much smaller and more marginalized community, but it's changing.""

Party politics
In the 2000 Presidential election, 78 percent of Muslim Americans supported Republican candidate George W. Bush over Democratic candidate Al Gore. However, due to increased anti-Muslim rhetoric from the Republican Party after the September 11 attacks, support for the Republican Party among American Muslims has declined sharply.

By 2004, Bush's Muslim support had been reduced to under 1%, and Democratic candidate John Kerry's support rose to 93%, with 5% voting for Ralph Nader.
By 2008, Democratic candidate Barack Obama got 67% to 90% of the Muslim vote depending on region. In total, Obama won 89% of the Muslim vote, with his Republican opponent John McCain getting only 2%. Some of his opponents question Obama's religious faith; see Barack Obama religion conspiracy theories.
By 2012, Barack Obama's support slightly falls to 85%, with 4% voting for his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney.
In a 2017 Survey done by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, only 15% of American Muslims wanted Donald Trump to win the 2016 presidential election, compared to 54% wanting Hillary Clinton to win. 74% of Muslims ended up voting for Clinton, compared to 13% for Trump.
According to a 2018 poll from the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, American Muslims were as satisfied with the American trajectory as the general public, reporting at around 27%. Regarding the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump, Muslims are the least likely to approve of him across all faith groups including non affiliated Americans. This compares to, ""17% of non-affiliated Americans, 31% of Jews, 36% of Catholics, 41% of Protestants, and 72% of white Evangelicals"".
According to the report belongs to a Boston-based organization that works to increase American Muslim education and civic engagement, ""at least 145 American Muslims, virtually all of them Democrats, ran for state or national public office in 2018. Of these, 110 were first-time candidates who represent an unprecedented rise for a diverse Muslim community that is typically underrepresented in American politics."".

In 2020, Democratic candidate Joe Biden received 69% of the Muslim vote, whereas Republican candidate Donald Trump received 17% (an increase from 13% in 2016) (excluding those who refused to answer, it would be 78% for Biden and 19% for Trump). Another survey showed that 86% of Muslims voted for Joe Biden, compared to just 6% for Trump. The remaining 8% either did not vote or supported a different candidate. 
American Muslim political engagement is increasing, as 75% of American Muslims surveyed by ISPU reported being registered to vote, an increase of 15% from 2016 data. In January 2019, Sadaf Jaffer became the first female Muslim American mayor, first female South Asian mayor, and first female Pakistani-American mayor in the United States, of Montgomery in Somerset County, New Jersey. In June 2022, Republican candidate Mehmet Oz became the first Muslim to be nominated by a major party for the U.S. Senate.
During the 2024 United States presidential election, An August 2024 survey published by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) found that 29% of Muslim voters planned to vote for Jill Stein. In Michigan, 40 percent of Muslim voters supported Stein, 18% supported Trump and 12% supported Harris. CAIR's final election poll, published on November 1, showed that nationwide among Muslims, 42.3% planned to vote for Stein, 41% for Harris, and 9.8% for Trump. In CAIR's exit poll, published on November 8th, 53% of Muslims voted for the Green Party candidate, Jill Stein. Only 20% of Muslims voted for Harris and only 21% voted for Trump.

Organizations
One of the largest Islamic organizations is the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) which says that 27% of mosques in the U.S. are associated with it. ISNA is an association of immigrant Muslim organizations and individuals that provides a common platform for presenting Islam. It is composed mostly of immigrants. Its membership may have recently exceeded ASM, as many independent mosques throughout the United States are choosing to affiliate with it. ISNA's annual convention is the largest gathering of Muslims in the United States.
The second largest Muslim organization is the community under the leadership of W. Deen Mohammed or the American Society of Muslims with 19% of mosques, mostly African-Americans having an affiliation with it. It was the successor organization to the Nation of Islam, once better-known as the Black Muslims. The association recognizes the leadership of Warith Deen Mohammed. This group evolved from the Black separatist Nation of Islam (1930–1975). The majority of its members are African Americans. This has been a 23-year process of religious reorientation and organizational decentralization, in the course of which the group was known by other names, such as the American Muslim Mission, W.Deen Mohammed guided its members to the practice of mainstream Islam such as salat or fasting, and teaching the basic creed of Islam the shahadah.

The third largest group is the Islamic Circle of North America (ICNA). ICNA describes itself as a non-ethnic, open to all, independent, North America-wide, grass-roots organization. It is composed mostly of immigrants and the children of immigrants. It is growing as various independent mosques throughout the United States join and also may be larger than ASM at the present moment. Its youth division is Young Muslims. Why Islam? is a community outreach project of ICNA; it seeks to provide accurate information about Islam while debunking popular stereotypes and common misconceptions through various services and outreach activities.
The Islamic Supreme Council of America (ISCA) is a small organization representing Sufi teachings, which, according to adherents, is the inner, mystical dimension of Islam. The ISCA's stated aims include providing practical solutions for American Muslims, based on the traditional Islamic legal rulings of an international advisory board, many of whom are recognized as the highest ranking Islamic scholars in the world. ISCA strives to integrate traditional scholarship in resolving contemporary issues affecting the maintenance of Islamic beliefs in a modern, secular society. It has been linked to neoconservative thought.

The Islamic Assembly of North America (IANA) is a leading Muslim organization in the United States. According to its website, among the goals of IANA is to ""unify and coordinate the efforts of the different dawah oriented organizations in North America and guide or direct the Muslims of this land to adhere to the proper Islamic methodology."" In order to achieve its goals, IANA uses a number of means and methods including conventions, general meetings, dawah-oriented institutions and academies, etc. IANA folded in the aftermath of the attack of September 11, 2001 and they have reorganized under various banners such as Texas Dawah and the Almaghrib Institute.
The Muslim Students' Association (MSA) is a group dedicated, by its own description, to Islamic societies on college campuses in Canada and the United States for the good of Muslim students. The MSA is involved in providing Muslims on various campuses the opportunity to practice their religion and to ease and facilitate such activities. MSA is also involved in social activities, such as fund raisers for the homeless during Ramadan. The founders of MSA would later establish the Islamic Society of North America and Islamic Circle of North America.
The Islamic Information Center (IIC) is a ""grass-roots"" organization that has been formed for the purpose of informing the public, mainly through the media, about the real image of Islam and Muslims. The IIC is run by chairman (Hojatul-Islam) Imam Syed Rafiq Naqvi, various committees, and supported by volunteers.
The Shia Muslim Foundation (SMF) works to support civic rights of American Shia Muslims, and to advocate on social and political issues. SMF is noted for working with both Shia community leaders and Shia Islamic scholars and clergy in accomplishing its work.
The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community was established in the U.S. in 1921, before the existence of Nation of Islam, according to its members.
Muslim Congress, a charitable non-profit social welfare organization, aimed at promoting Islamic knowledge, morality, and values amongst Muslims in North America. They run social projects like food distribution to the homeless in their ""No More Hunger"" project.

Political
Muslim political organizations lobby on behalf of various Muslim political interests. Organizations such as the American Muslim Council are actively engaged in upholding human and civil rights for all Americans.

The Council on American–Islamic Relations (CAIR) is the United States largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy group, originally established to promote a positive image of Islam and Muslims in America. CAIR presents itself as representing mainstream, moderate Islam, and has condemned acts of terrorism and has been working in collaboration with the White House on ""issues of safety and foreign policy."" The group has been criticized for alleged links to Islamic terrorism and it has been designated as a terrorist group by the United Arab Emirates.
The Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC) is an American Muslim public service and policy organization headquartered in Los Angeles and with offices in Washington, D.C. MPAC was founded in 1988. The mission of MPAC ""encompasses promoting an American Muslim identity, fostering an effective grassroots organization, and training a future generation of men and women to share our vision. MPAC also works to promote an accurate portrayal of Islam and Muslims in mass media and popular culture, educating the American public (both Muslim and non-Muslim) about Islam, building alliances with diverse communities and cultivating relationships with opinion- and decision-makers.""
The American Islamic Congress is a small secular Muslim organization that promotes ""religious pluralism"". Their official Statement of Principles states that ""Muslims have been profoundly influenced by their encounter with America. American Muslims are a minority group, consisting largely of immigrants and children of immigrants, who have prospered in America's climate of religious tolerance and civil rights. The lessons of our unprecedented experience of acceptance and success must be carefully considered by our community."" The AIC holds an annual essay writing competition, the Dream Deferred Essay Contest, focusing on civil rights in the Middle East.
The Free Muslims Coalition states it was created to ""eliminate broad base support for Islamic extremism and terrorism"" and to strengthen secular democratic institutions in the Middle East and the Muslim World by supporting Islamic reformation efforts.

Charitable
Charitable donations within the Muslim American community are impacted by domestic political and social climates. ISPU found in 2017 that, “23% of Muslim Americans increased their giving to organizations associated with their faith community and 18% joined, donated to, or volunteered at a civic organizations for the first time as a result of the 2016 national elections. A 2021 study showed that Muslim Americans donated more to charity than other Americans during 2020. Most of the donations were given to causes supporting poverty relief, COVID-19 relief, civil rights, and religious research.
In addition to the organizations listed above, other Muslim organizations in the United States serve more specific needs. For example, some organizations focus almost exclusively on charity work. As a response to a crackdown on Muslim charity organizations working overseas such as the Holy Land Foundation, more Muslims have begun to focus their charity efforts within the United States.

Inner-City Muslim Action Network (IMAN) is one of the leading Muslim charity organizations in the United States. According to the Inner-City Muslim Action Network, IMAN seeks ""to utilize the tremendous possibilities and opportunities that are present in the community to build a dynamic and vibrant alternative to the difficult conditions of inner city life."" IMAN sees understanding Islam as part of a larger process to empower individuals and communities to work for the betterment of humanity.

Research and think tanks
The Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, with offices in Dearborn, MI and Washington, DC, is an independent, nonpartisan research organization specializing in addressing the most pressing challenges facing the American Muslim community and in bridging the information gap between the American Muslim community and the wider society.

Views
Religiosity
A nationwide survey conducted in 2003 by the Pew Research Center and the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life reported that the percentage of Americans with an unfavorable view of Islam increased by one percentage point between 2002 and 2003 to 34%, and then by another two percentage points in 2005 to 36%. At the same time the percentage responding that Islam was more likely than other religion to encourage violence fell from 44% in July 2003 to 36% in July 2005.

The July 2005 Pew survey also showed that 59% of American adults view Islam as ""very different from their religion,"" down one percentage point from 2003. In the same survey 55% had a favorable opinion of Muslim Americans, up four percentage points from 51% in July 2003. A December 2004 Cornell University survey shows that 47% of Americans believe that the Islamic religion is more likely than others to encourage violence among its believers.
A CBS April 2006 poll showed that, in terms of faiths

58% of Americans have favorable attitudes toward Protestantism/Other Christians
48% favorable toward Catholicism
47% favorable toward Judaism
31% favorable toward Christian fundamentalism
20% favorable toward Mormonism
19% favorable toward Islam
8% favorable toward Scientology
The Pew survey shows that, in terms of adherents

77% of Americans have favorable opinions of Jews
73% favorable of Catholics
57% favorable of ""evangelical Christians""
55% favorable of Muslims
35% favorable of Atheists
Pew surveys conducted in 2014, 2017, and 2019 continued this trend showing Americans had the least favorable views toward Muslims and Atheists.
A 2011 Gallup poll found that 56% of Protestants, 63% of Catholics, and 70% of Jews believed that American Muslims had no sympathy for Al Qaeda. A 2015 Brookings poll found that 14% Americans believe most Muslims support ISIS and another 44% believe Muslims partially support ISIS. Political party also plays a role in whether Americans believe Islam encourages violence. Over the years, Republicans have become more likely to state they believe Islam encourages violence more than other religions, while Democrats are more likely to say it does not.
A 2016 poll found that on average; Americans believed that 17% of the US population was Muslim and that this number would rise to 23% by 2020.
A 2018 poll by The Institute for Social Policy and Understanding found that 86% of Americans report wanting to, “live in a country where no one is targeted for their religious identity.” 95% of American Jews and 78% of white Evangelicals agreed. The study also found that 66% of Americans agree that “the negative things politicians say regarding Muslims is harmful to our country.” Breaking down the results by faith community, 78% of Muslims and non-affiliated Americans agreed, contrasted with only 45% of white Evangelicals. Most Americans oppose banning the building of mosques (79%), the surveillance of U.S. mosques (63%), and a ‘Muslim Ban’ (~63%). Most Americans also take issue with the collective blaming of Muslims for the acts of individuals, and 69% of those surveyed believe Muslims are no more responsible for violence carried out by a Muslim than anyone else. ISPU writes that, “Though at a lower rate, the majority of Americans (55%) say that most Muslims living in the United States are committed to the well-being of America.”
According to a research by the New America foundation and the American Muslim Initiative found in 2018, 56 percent of Americans believed Islam was compatible with American values and 42 percent said it was not. About 60 percent believed US Muslims were as patriotic as others, while 38 percent they were not. The study also found that a big majority of Americans - 74 percent - accepted there was ""a lot"" of bigotry against Muslims existed. Researchers also found that Republicans were more likely to hold negative perceptions of Muslims with 71 percent.
A 2021 Pew study found that 78% of Americans believe Muslims face discrimination, which was a higher percentage than for other religions.

On the United States
In a 2007 survey titled Muslim Americans: Middle Class and Mostly Mainstream, the Pew Research Center found Muslim Americans to be ""largely integrated, happy with their lives, and moderate with respect to many of the issues that have divided Muslims and Westerners around the world.""
47% of respondents said they considered themselves Muslims first and Americans second. However, this was compared to 81% of British Muslims and 69% of German Muslims, when asked the equivalent question. A similar disparity exists in income, the percentage of American Muslims living in poverty is 2% higher than the general population, compared to an 18% disparity for French Muslims and 29% difference for Spanish Muslims.
Politically, American Muslims both supported larger government and are socially conservative. Despite their social conservatism, 71% of American Muslims expressed a preference for the Democratic Party. The Pew Research survey also showed that nearly three quarters of respondents believed that American society rewards them for hard work regardless of their religious background.
The same poll also reported that 40% of U.S. Muslims believe that Arab Muslims carried out the 9/11 attacks. Another 28% do not believe it and 32% said they had no opinion. Among the 28% who doubted that Arab Muslims were behind the conspiracy, one-fourth said the U.S. government or President George W. Bush was responsible. 26% of American Muslims believe the U.S.-led ""war on terror"" is a sincere effort to root out international terrorism. 5% of those surveyed had a ""very favorable"" or ""somewhat favorable"" view of Al-Qaeda. 35% of American Muslims stated that the decision for military action in Afghanistan was the right one and 12% supported the use of military force in Iraq.
Although American Muslims do report feeling discriminated against as a religious minority, they are just as likely as the general public (81%) to say they value their American Identity. In fact, a 2018 study done by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding asserts that, “a higher religious identity correlates with a higher American identity among all Americans, especially Muslims.”

LGBT
American Muslims in the 2000s and early 2010s showed generally conservative views about homosexuality, with only about 27% of American Muslims saying it should be accepted by society in 2007, compared to 51% of the entire US public in 2006, according to the Pew Research Center. However, this later rose to 39% in 2011 (compared to 58% of the entire US public), and eventually in 2017, rising to a majority at 52% of American Muslims approving of societal acceptance of homosexuality, on par with the approval of Protestants, although lower than the total US public approval rate of 63%.
A 2017 survey by the Public Religion Research Institute showed that a slim majority of Muslims at 51% supported gay marriage, compared to 34% opposed.
Hamtramck, Michigan the only Muslim-majority city in the United States and the first city to have a Muslim-majority city council in the history of the United States, with four of the six council members being Muslim. In June 2023, the city drew scrutiny for its ban of the rainbow flag on city property and perceived homophobia.

Concerns and perceptions
A 2011 Pew poll reported support for extremism among Muslim Americans is negligible. The poll indicated all segments of the Muslim American population were opposed to violence and to a correlation between support for suicide bombing and religiosity measures. A 2007 Pew poll reported that very few Muslim Americans (1%) supported suicide bombings against civilian targets in at least some circumstances, with 81% reporting that suicide bombings and other forms of violence against civilians are never justified. Favorable views towards Al Qaeda were held by a comparably smaller percentage among Muslim Americans, 2% very favorable and 3% somewhat favorable. 15% of American Muslims under the age of 30 supported suicide bombings against civilian targets in at least some circumstances, on the other hand, 11% said it could be ""rarely justified"" in a 2007 Pew poll. Among those over the age of 30, just 6% expressed their support for the same. (9% of Muslims over 30 and 5% under 30 chose not to answer).

Terrorism that involved Muslim perpetrators began in the United States with the 1993 shootings at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia, followed by the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York City. After the September 11 attacks and the start of the Afghanistan war in 2001, there was concern about the potential radicalization of American Muslims.
Between 2001 and the end of 2009, there were 46 publicly reported incidents of ""domestic radicalization and recruitment to jihadist terrorism"" that involved at least 125 people between 2001 and the end of 2009. There had been an average of six cases per year since 2001, but that rose to 13 in 2009.
While the seeming increase in cases may be alarming, half ""involve single individuals, while the rest represent ‘tiny conspiracies,’ "" according to Congressional testimony. Furthermore, a 2012 study by the University of North Carolina indicated that the yearly number of cases of alleged plots by Muslim-Americans appears to be declining. The total of 20 indictments for terrorism in 2011 is down from 26 in 2010 and 47 in 2009 (the total since 9/11 is 193). The number of Muslim-Americans indicted for support of terrorism also fell, from 27 individuals in 2010 to just eight in 2011 (the total since 9/11 stands at 462). Also in apparent decline is the number of actual attacks: Of the 20 suspects indicted for terrorism, only one was charged with carrying out a terrorist act. This number is down from the six individuals charged with attacks in 2010.
Muslim Americans are significantly represented among those who tip authorities off to alleged plots having given 52 of the 140 documented tips regarding individuals involved in violent terrorist plots since 9/11 up to 2012.
The Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 caused 280 injuries, and 5 civilian and police deaths. Attempted attacks, like the Curtis Culwell Center attack and 2015 Boston beheading plot have attracted substantial media coverage and inflamed community relations. In 2015 the New America Foundation released information about violent extremist groups in the US. While the Boston Marathon bombing had a high injury toll, only four deaths were counted by the group, and the group's count of only deaths from violent extremism showed that since 9/11, 48 people had been killed by anti-government extremists, compared to 28 by Jihadists.
Some Muslim Americans have been criticized because of perceived conflicts between their religious beliefs and mainstream American value systems. Muslim cab drivers in Minneapolis, Minnesota have been criticized for refusing passengers for carrying alcoholic beverages or dogs. The Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport authority has threatened to revoke the operating authority of any driver caught discriminating in this manner. There are reported incidents in which Muslim cashiers have refused to sell pork products to their clientele.

Jihadist extremism
In 2002, John Walker Lindh was convicted on charges of working with the Taliban and carrying weapons against American soldiers. He had converted to Islam while in the United States, moved to Yemen to study Arabic, and then went to Pakistan, where he was recruited by the Taliban.
José Padilla, a Hispanic-American, was convicted and imprisoned on suspicion of plotting a radiological bomb (""dirty bomb"") attack. After marrying a Muslim woman, Padilla converted to Islam and moved to the Middle East. While living in the Middle East from 2001 to early 2002, he was recruited and trained by al-Qaeda. On May 8, 2002, he was detained in Chicago. President George W. Bush designated him an enemy combatant and, arguing that he was not entitled to trial in civilian courts, had him transferred to a military prison.
In 2015, a twenty four-year-old Kuwaiti man, Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez, a naturalized US citizen with an engineering degree, killed four U.S. Marines and injured three at two facilities in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Islamophobia
In the first half of 2024, anti-Muslim incidents rose about 70% amid Gaza attack. According to a 2011 Gallup poll, over the preceding decade, there had been an increase in Islamophobia, which it defined as ""an exaggerated fear, hatred, and hostility toward Islam and Muslims that is perpetuated by negative stereotypes resulting in bias, discrimination, and the marginalization and exclusion of Muslims from social, political, and civic life."" Another 2011 poll provided by The Washington Post through the Public Religion Research Institute states that 48 percent of Americans are uncomfortable with Muslim women wearing the burqa. A 2014 Pew Research Center survey found that Muslims were the most disliked religious group in the United States with an average ""cold"" rating of 40 (out of 100), which is lower than the 41 cold ratings received by atheists. According to a poll in November 2015 by the Public Religion Research Institute 56 percent of Americans believe that the values of Islam are at odds with the American values and ways of life.
Public institutions in the U.S. have also drawn fire for accommodating Islam at the expense of taxpayers. The University of Michigan–Dearborn and a public college in Minnesota have been criticized for accommodating Islamic prayer rituals by constructing footbaths for Muslim students using taxpayer money. Critics said this special accommodation, which is made to satisfy the needs of Muslims alone, is a violation of Constitutional provisions separating church and state. Along the same constitutional lines, in 2007 a San Diego public elementary school was criticized for making special accommodations, specifically for American Muslims, by adding Arabic to its curriculum and giving breaks for Muslim prayers. Some critics said exceptions have not been made for any religious group in the past, and they see this as an endorsement of Islam.
The first American Muslim Congressman, Keith Ellison, created controversy when he compared President George W. Bush's actions after the September 11, 2001 attacks to Adolf Hitler's actions after the Nazi-sparked Reichstag fire, saying that Bush was exploiting the aftermath of 9/11 for political gain, as Hitler had exploited the Reichstag fire to suspend constitutional liberties. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Anti-Defamation League condemned Ellison's remarks. The congressman later retracted the statement, saying that it was ""inappropriate"" for him to have made the comparison.
In April 2018, former President Donald Trump instigated a ban on Muslim immigration to America that still reverberates today. America had already some of the lowest percentages (about 1.1% of the total US population) of Muslims among Western nations, and with the ban in 2018, many African Muslims were also barred from traveling to the U.S. or seeking refuge there. The ban had a dramatic impact, but the measure was immediately rescinded in 2021, when Joe Biden took office. Muslim Americans, rights advocates and immigration experts, however, say the policy continues to have a lingering effect on Muslim citizens, as well as on their family members living abroad, unable to join their loved ones in America.

2018 ISPU Poll
In the American Muslim Poll 2018, the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding set out ""to measure the level of public anti-Muslim sentiment"" in the United States.
The following graph shows data across six different faith populations in the United States, and their answers to the two questions below (""W. Evang."" is short for White Evangelical, the specific demographic surveyed):
Question 1: Some people think that for the military to target and kill civilians is sometimes justified, while others think that this kind of violence is never justified. Which is your opinion?
Question 2: Some people think that for an individual or a small group of people to target and kill civilians is sometimes justified, while others think that this kind of violence is never justified. Which is your opinion?

The following graph contains additional data collected by ISPU during their 2018 poll. The following statements were posed to participants and they were asked to answer on a scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. The chart below shows the total percentage from each American faith demographic that agreed with the statements below. (Note: ""W. Evang."" is short for White Evangelical, the specific demographic surveyed.)
Question 1: I want to live in a country where no one is targeted for their religious identity
Question 2: The negative things politicians say regarding Muslims is harmful to our country
Question 3: Most Muslims living in the United States are committed to the wellbeing of America
Question 4: Most people associate negative stereotypes with my faith identity

Prejudice
After the September 11 attacks, America saw an increase in the number of hate crimes committed against people who were perceived to be Muslim, particularly those of Middle Eastern and South Asian descent. More than 20 acts of discrimination and violence were documented in the post 9/11 era by the U.S. Department of Justice. Some of these acts were against Muslims living in America. Other acts were against those accused of being Muslims, such as Sikhs, and people of Arabian and South-Asian backgrounds A publication in Journal of Applied Social Psychology found evidence that the number of anti-Muslim attacks in America in 2001 increased from 354 to 1,501 following 9/11. The same year, the Arab American Institute reported an increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes ranging from discrimination and destruction of private property to violent threats and assaults, some of which resulted in deaths.
In a 2007 survey, 53% of American Muslims reported that it was more difficult to be a Muslim after the 9/11 attacks. Asked to name the most important problem facing them, the options named by more than ten percent of American Muslims were discrimination (19%), being viewed as a terrorist (15%), public's ignorance about Islam (13%), and stereotyping (12%). 54% believe that the U.S. government's anti-terrorism activities single out Muslims. 76% of surveyed Muslim Americans stated that they are very or somewhat concerned about the rise of Islamic extremism around the world, while 61% express a similar concern about the possibility of Islamic extremism in the United States.
On a small number of occasions Muslim women who wore distinctive hijab were harassed, causing some Muslim women to stay at home, while others temporarily abandoned the practice. In November 2009 Amal Abusumayah, a mother of four young girls, had her hijab pulled following derogatory comments while grocery shopping. In 2006, one California woman was shot dead as she walked her child to school; she was wearing a headscarf and relatives and Muslim leaders believe that the killing was religiously motivated. While 51% of American Muslims express worry that women wearing hijab will be treated poorly, 44% of American Muslim women who always wear hijab express a similar concern.
In 2011, The Learning Channel (TLC) broadcast a television series, All-American Muslim, depicting the lives of different American Muslims in Dearborn, Michigan.
Even 16 years after 9/11, studies show that 42% Muslim Americans report bullying of their children in school because of their faith. One in four bullying incidents involving Muslims is rerouted to have involved a teacher or other school official. Policies regarding immigration and airport security have also impacted Muslim American Lives after 9/11, with Muslims being twice as likely as any other faith group surveyed to be stopped at the border for additional screening. 67% of Muslims who were stopped at a US border also reported that they were easily identifiable as a member of their faith group. The climate of the 2016 presidential election and the policies that followed have also affected the lives and sentiments of Muslims Americans when it comes to their own safety. Muslims and Jews are, “most likely to express fear for their personal safety or that of their family from white supremacist groups as a result of the 2016 elections.” Overall, the majority of nonwhite Muslims do report some level of race-based discrimination in the past year. When it comes to religious based discrimination, Muslim Americans as a whole were the most likely faith group to report it.

Hindu Americans in the United States largely include first and second generation immigrants from India and other South Asian countries, while there are also local converts and followers. Several aspects related to Hinduism, such as yoga, karma, and meditation have been adopted into mainstream American beliefs and lifestyles.
Hinduism is one of the Dharmic religions and adheres to the concept of dharma, a cosmic order. The dharmic principle of reincarnation has gained popularity in the United States. According to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life survey of 2009, 24% of Americans believe in reincarnation, a core concept of Hinduism and Dharmic religions. The Hindu practices of vegetarianism and ahimsa are also becoming more widespread. Om is a widely chanted mantra, particularly among millennials and those who practice yoga and subscribe to the New Age philosophy.
Historically, American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson studied the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita around 1857 and published a related poem, ""Brahma"". In 1893, Swami Vivekananda's address to the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago was one of the first major discussions of Hinduism in the United States. In 1925, Paramahansa Yogananda became the first Kriya Yoga teacher to settle in America. In the 1960s, Beatles member George Harrison played songs that included Hindu mantra Hare Krishna, and helped popularize Hinduism in America. 
The Hindu community in the United States began to grow after the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. As a result of U.S. immigration policies that favored educated and highly skilled migrants from India, Hindu Americans are the most likely to hold college degrees and earn high incomes among all religious communities in the United States. More recently, Hindu Americans have become politically active in the mainstream American political landscape. In 2012, Tulsi Gabbard became the first Hindu-American member of U.S. Congress.","Hinduism in the United States is a religious denomination comprising around 1% of the population, nearly the same as Buddhism and Islam. Hindu Americans in the United States largely include first and second generation immigrants from India and other South Asian countries, while there are also local converts and followers. Several aspects related to Hinduism, such as yoga, karma, and meditation have been adopted into mainstream American beliefs and lifestyles.
Hinduism is one of the Dharmic religions and adheres to the concept of dharma, a cosmic order. The dharmic principle of reincarnation has gained popularity in the United States. According to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life survey of 2009, 24% of Americans believe in reincarnation, a core concept of Hinduism and Dharmic religions. The Hindu practices of vegetarianism and ahimsa are also becoming more widespread. Om is a widely chanted mantra, particularly among millennials and those who practice yoga and subscribe to the New Age philosophy.
Historically, American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson studied the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita around 1857 and published a related poem, ""Brahma"". In 1893, Swami Vivekananda's address to the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago was one of the first major discussions of Hinduism in the United States. In 1925, Paramahansa Yogananda became the first Kriya Yoga teacher to settle in America. In the 1960s, Beatles member George Harrison played songs that included Hindu mantra Hare Krishna, and helped popularize Hinduism in America. 
The Hindu community in the United States began to grow after the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. As a result of U.S. immigration policies that favored educated and highly skilled migrants from India, Hindu Americans are the most likely to hold college degrees and earn high incomes among all religious communities in the United States. More recently, Hindu Americans have become politically active in the mainstream American political landscape. In 2012, Tulsi Gabbard became the first Hindu-American member of U.S. Congress.

History
Pioneering thinkers in the United States began to assimilate Hindu and Dharmic thought long before the arrival of Hindu immigrants. Among the first was the American philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson, who in 1857 published a poem, ""Brahma,"" in the first issue of the literary magazine The Atlantic Monthly, which he had helped to found. The work contained the lines ""I am the doubter and the doubt, I am the hymn the Brahmin sings."" Emerson was expressing the Hindu philosophy of non-duality, Advaita. Another pioneer was Madame Blavatsky, co-founder in 1875 of The Theosophical Society in New York, her philosophy blending several Asian traditions  and stressed the importance of Patanjali's system of yoga.

Early Hindu scholars in US
In 1893, Swami Vivekananda's address to the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago was one of the first major discussions of Hinduism in the United States. He spent two years lecturing in several U.S. cities, including Detroit, Boston, and New York. Swami Vivekananda's multiple lectures in the United States from 1893 to 1895 effectively introduced Hinduism to the country. He also introduced Yoga philosophy and a mixture of yoga breathwork (pranayama) and meditation.
Starting in 1902, Swami Rama Tirtha spent two years speaking on the philosophy of Vedanta in the United States. 
In 1920, Paramahansa Yogananda was India's delegate to the International Congress of Religious Liberals held in Boston. He embarked on a successful speaking tour in the US before settling in Los Angeles in 1925, where he trained disciples in Kriya Yoga. Yogananda was among the first Indian Yoga teachers to settle in the US, and the first prominent Hindu scholar to be hosted in the White House in 1927. He published his Autobiography of a Yogi in 1946, which was recognized as one of the best spiritual books of the 20th Century.

Bhagavad Gita in America
Around 1857, the American poet-philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson, who led the Transcendentalist movement of the mid-19th century, studied the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita. The Bhagavad Gita is a central text in Hinduism and a synthesis of various strands of Hindu religious thought, including the Vedic concept of dharma (duty, rightful action); samkhya-based yoga and jnana (knowledge); and bhakti (devotion). Emerson noted that  Gita's message was an allegory for the inner battle between good and evil in the human soul.
In the late 19th century, Swami Vivekananda's speeches in America contained numerous references to the Gita, and the four yogas – bhakti, jnana, karma, and raja , and through the message of the Gita, Vivekananda sought to re-emphasize the core tenets of Hindu thought both in India and America.
In the 20th century, an American scholar of Hindu philosophy, Gerald James Larson, who was a Professor of Indian Cultures and Civilization at Indiana University, Bloomington as well as Professor of Religious Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, stated that ""if there is any one text that comes near to embodying the totality of what it is to be a Hindu, it would be the Bhagavad Gita.""

Influence on counter-culture movement
During the 1960s, Hindu teachers found a receptive audience in the U.S. counter-culture, leading to the formation of a number of Neo-Hindu movements, such as the International Society for Krishna Consciousness founded by Swami Prabhupada. People involved in the counter-culture such as Ram Dass, George Harrison, and Allen Ginsberg were influential in the spread of Hinduism in the United States.
Ram Dass was a Harvard professor known as Richard Alpert who traveled to India in 1967 and studied under Neem Karoli Baba. He returned the West as a Hindu teacher and changed his name to Ram Dass, which means servant of Rama (one of the Hindu gods). Jeffery Kagel commonly known as Krishna Das, went to India in the sixties and returned to America as a practitioner of Bhakti yoga and singer of Hindu devotional music known as kirtan (chanting the names of God), described by the New York Times as ""the chant master of American yoga"".
Beatles member George Harrison  became a devotee of Swami Prabhupada. Harrison started to record songs with the words ""Hari Krishna"" in the lyrics and was widely responsible for popularizing Hinduism in America in the 1960s and 1970s. His song, My Sweet Lord, became the biggest-selling single of 1971 in the United Kingdom. In 1967, the Human Be-In event held in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park  as a prelude to San Francisco's Summer of Love, a symbol of American counterculture, and involved chanting of ""Om"" by Allen Ginsberg, a follower of Hinduism.
In 1974, Alfred Ford, the great-grandson of Henry Ford, joined the ISKCON, a Vaishnava Hindu group and helped establish the first Hindu temple in Hawaii and the Bhakti Vedanta Cultural Centre in Detroit. Other influential Indians of Hindu faith in the counter-culture movement are Mata Amritanandamayi, Chinmoy and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

Demographics
According to the 2023–24 Pew Research Center Religious Landscape Study, Hindus comprise approximately 0.9% of the U.S. adult population, representing a 0.5 percentage point increase from 0.4% in 2007. The Hindu population of the United States is the eighth-largest in the world. Most Hindus in the United States are of Asian Indian origin, and about 80% of Asian Indian immigrants practice Hinduism. The US Hindu population has been growing over the recent decades. In a 2025 survey,  84% of Hindus reported their ethnic origin from Asian countries. 
Earlier in a 2015 survey, most Hindus in America were immigrants (87%) or the children of immigrants (9%), while the remaining were converts. The majority of Hindus are immigrants from South Asia. There are also Hindus from the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, Canada, Oceania, Africa, Europe and the Middle East. In the U.S. there are also about 900 ethnic Cham people from Vietnam, one of the few remaining non-Indic Hindus in the world, 55% of whom are Hindus. 
From 2008 to 2017, around 90000 Hindu Bhutanese refugees were resettled in the United States. Earlier in 1988, a census in Bhutan resulted in ethnic and linguistic tensions against the Nepali-speaking Hindu Lhotshampa ethnic group, leading to them becoming Bhutanese refugees in Nepal.  Many Afghan Hindus have also settled in United States, mainly after Soviet–Afghan War and the rise of the Taliban. A number of Hindu-Americans immigrated twice, first from former British colonies of East Africa, the Caribbean, Fiji to the United Kingdom, and then to the United States.
According to the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies, in 2017 Hindus were the largest minority religion in 92 of the 3143 counties in the US. Although Hinduism is practiced mainly by people of South Asian descent, a sizable number of Hindus in United States are converts to Hinduism. According to the Pew Research Center, 9% of Hindus in United States belong to a non-Asian ethnicity: White (4%), Black (2%), Latino (1%) and mixed (2%). 
As per the 2020 census, the median age of Hindus in the United States was 36 years, which is lower than the national average of 47 years. Hindus are the second youngest religious group, after Muslims (33 years). While as per 2023, the median age of Hindus have increased to 42 years.

Education and income
American Hindus have the highest rates of educational attainment and highest household income among all religious communities, and the lowest divorce rates. In 2008, according to Pew Research Center, 80% of American adults who were raised as Hindus continued to adhere to Hinduism, which is the highest retention rate for any religion in America.
Due to the U.S. immigration policies, most of the Hindu immigrants have been educated and highly skilled professionals, most likely to hold college degrees.
Historically, some notable Hindus came to America for education in the late 19th and 20th centuries. Anandibai Joshi is believed to be the first Hindu woman to set foot on American soil, arriving in New York in June 1883 at the age of 19, graduating with a medical degree from the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania in March 1886, becoming the first female of South Asian origin to graduate with a degree in Western medicine in the United States.

Religiosity
According to a 2014 Pew Research survey, 88% of the American Hindu population believed in God (versus 89% of adults overall). However, only 26% believed that religion is very important in their life. About 51% of the Hindu population reported praying daily.
According to the Pew Research Center, only 15% of the Americans identified the Vedas as a Hindu religious text. Roughly half of Americans knew that yoga has roots in Hinduism.

Languages spoken
Since Hindu Americans come from a diverse linguistic background, they speak many languages including the following: 
English, Hindi and its varieties, Telugu, Gujarati, Bengali, Tamil, Punjabi, Nepali,Marathi, Malayalam|Kannada, Sindhi, Kashmiri, Assamese, Dogri, and Odia.
Further, smaller groups of Hindu Americans also speak the following:
Tulu, Angika, Maithili, Bhojpuri, Magahi, Newar, Konkani, Gondi, Kurukh, Kokborok, Meitei, Limbu, Gurung, Tamang, Magar, Rai, Boro, Santali, Nagpuri, Khandeshi, Pashto, Hindko, Saraiki, Rajasthani languages, Pahari languages, Bhil languages, Tharu languages, other South Asian languages, Hinglish, Caribbean English, Caribbean Hindustani, Fiji Hindi, Mauritian Creole, Dutch, Polish, French, Malay, Russian, Balinese, German, Tenggerese, Cham, Romani, Spanish and other languages.

Socio-cultural engagement
Adaption to Western culture
Many of the early Hindu emissaries to the United States drew on ideological confluences between Christian and Hindu universalism. Hindu temples in the United States tend to house more than one deity corresponding with a different tradition, unlike those in India which tend to house deities from a single tradition. Yoga become part of many American's lifestyle, but its meaning has shifted. While Hindus in the United States may refer to the practice as a form of meditation that has different forms (i.e. karma yoga, bhakti yoga, kriya yoga), it is used in reference to the physical aspect of the word.

Social views
In 2019, a Pew survey noted that 71% of Hindus believed that homosexuality should be accepted, which is higher than the general public (62%).. The same study also said that about 68% of Hindus supported same-sex marriage, vs. 53% of the general public. The 2019 Pew survey also noted that Hindus in the United States support abortion rights (68%). Further, the same survey indicated that about 69% of Hindus supported regulations to protect the environment and nature.

Influence on Pop Culture
Hinduism has influenced several Hollywood movies such as Eat Pray Love, which is a movie about a ""modern American woman’s journey towards peace through Indian spiritual practices,"" including spending time at a Hindu ashram in India and practicing yoga. The science fiction Interstellar, directed by Christopher Nolan is considered to be inspired by the central notion of universal super-consciousness that transcends space and time from the ancient Indian philosophical texts, the Upanishads. Oppenheimer, a biographical thriller by Christopher Nolan based on the life of the American physicist who helped develop the first nuclear bomb, shows the lead character, J. Robert Oppenheimer, reading and quoting from the Hindu scripture and Bhagavad Gita.
Several Hollywood actors follow Hindu traditions, including Julia Roberts, who is a practicing Hindu and played the role of a spiritual seeker in Eat, Pray, Love.  Hugh Jackman, Shawn Mendes, and Vin Diesel hold the Bhagavad Gita in high regard. Actor Will Smith is also known to follow Hindu rituals including a visit to India and participating in Ganga aarti prayer.

Hindu-Americans in politics
In September 2000, a joint session of Congress was opened with a prayer in Sanskrit (with some Hindi and English added), by Venkatachalapathi Samudrala to honor the visit of Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The gesture was an initiative by Ohio Congressman Sherrod Brown, who requested the U.S. Congress House Chaplain to invite the Hindu priest from the Shiva Vishnu Hindu Temple in Parma, Ohio. A Hindu prayer was read in the Senate on July 12, 2007, by Rajan Zed, a Hindu priest from Nevada, who served as the Senate guest Chaplain. His prayer was interrupted by a couple and their daughter who claimed to be Christian patriots, which prompted a criticism of candidates in the upcoming presidential election for not condemning the interruption. In October 2009, President Barack Obama lit a ceremonial Diwali lamp at the White House to symbolize victory of light over darkness.
In April 2009, President Obama appointed Anju Bhargava, a management consultant and pioneer community builder, to serve as a member of his inaugural Advisory Council on Faith Based and Neighborhood Partnership. In collaboration with the White House, Hindu American Seva Communities was formed to bring the Hindu seva voices to the forefront in the public arena and to bridge the gap between U.S. government and Hindu people and places of worship.
In the 2020 elections, Tulsi Gabbard became the first Hindu to run in the presidential race from Democratic Party, though later she endorsed Joe Biden. In 2021, the State of New Jersey joined with the World Hindu Council to declare October as Hindu Heritage Month.
In recent years, the political participation of Indian-Americans has increased with Vivek Ramaswamy being Hindu of Indian background running for the position of president in the 2024 elections from Republican Party, though he later endorsed Donald Trump.
In 2025, Tulsi Gabbard was sworn in as the director of national intelligence taking the role of President Donald Trump's top intelligence adviser, and became the first Hindu American to hold a Cabinet-level position.

Hindu temples in America
The Vedanta Society was responsible for building the earliest temples in the United States, starting in 1905 with the Old Temple in San Francisco, but they were not considered formal temples. The earliest traditional mandir in the United States is Shiva Kartikeya Temple in Concord, California. It was built in 1957 and is known as Palanisamy Temple. It is one of the few temples run by public elected members. The Maha Vallabha Ganapathi Devastanam, owned by the Hindu Temple Society of North America in Flushing, New York, was consecrated on July 4, 1977.
There are over 1,450 Hindu temples across the United States, with a majority on the east coast. The New York region has more than 1,135 temples; Texas has 128 and Massachusetts has 127.
Other temples include the Malibu Hindu Temple, built in 1981 in Calabasas, California, and owned and operated by the Hindu Temple Society of Southern California. In addition, Swaminarayan temples exist in almost 20 states.
The oldest Hindu temple in Texas is the Shree Raseshwari Radha Rani temple at Radha Madhav Dham, Austin. The temple was established by Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj. It is one of the largest Hindu temple complexes in the Western Hemisphere, and the largest in North America.
Parashakthi Temple in Pontiac, Michigan, is a Tirtha Peetham for Goddess ""Shakthi,"" or the ""Great Divine Mother"" in Hinduism. The temple was envisioned in 1994 by Dr. G. Krishna Kumar in a deep meditative Kundalini experience of ""Adi Shakthi"".
Akshardham in Robbinsville, New Jersey, is one of the largest stone Hindu temples in the United States.
In 2010, the Bharatiya Temple of Northwest Indiana temple was opened next to the Indian American Cultural Center in Merrillville, Indiana. The Bharatiya Temple allows four different Hindu groups as well as a Jain group to worship together.
The Sri Ganesha Temple of Alaska in Anchorage, Alaska, is the northernmost Hindu temple in the world.

Discrimination and biases
Early immigration struggles
As a result of the Bellingham Riots in Bellingham, Washington, on September 5, 1907, some 125 Indians (mostly Sikhs but labelled as Hindus) were driven out of town by a mob of 400-500 white men. Some victims of the riots migrated to Everett, Washington, where they received similar treatment two months later. Riots occurred during this period in Vancouver, British Columbia, and California.
In the 1923 case United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, the Supreme Court ruled that Thind and other South Asians were not ""free white persons"" according to a 1790 federal law that stated that only white immigrants could apply for naturalized citizenship. The Immigration Act of 1924 prohibited the immigration of Asians such as Middle Easterners and Indians.
The first wave of South Asian immigrants in America was predominantly Punjabi Sikhs, who migrated to the West Coast in the early 20th century due to economic hardships in India. They typically labored in agriculture, railroads, and lumberyards, establishing communities and the first Sikh temple in California by 1912. In the early 1900s, White Americans labeled all South Asian immigrants “Hindoos,” regardless of their religion, labeling them as an economic and cultural threat and leading to hostility, violent attacks, and forced expulsions by white workers in towns like Bellingham, Washington. Sentiments intensified through organizations like the Asiatic Exclusion League and widespread media portrayal of an alleged ""Hindoo invasion.""

Temple vandalism
In February 2015, Hindu temples in Kent and the Seattle Metropolitan area were vandalized, and in April 2015, a Hindu temple in north Texas was vandalized with xenophobic images spray-painted on its walls. In January 2019, the Swaminarayan Temple in Kentucky was vandalized. Black paint was sprayed on the deity; the words ""Jesus is the only God"" and the Christian cross was spray painted on various walls. 
Around 2022, there were several cases of vandalism of Hindu Temples in New York by Khalistan separatists, including the destruction of Mahatma Gandhi's statue outside Shri Tulsi Mandir in South Richmond Hill, New York, which was vandalized two times, first on August 03, 2022, and then on August 16, 2022, wherein 5-6 miscreants smashed the Gandhi statue with sledgehammers and spray painted Khalistan on the statue. In September 2022, a man named Sukhpal Singh was arrested and charged with a hate crime incident at the Hindu temple in Queens, New York, in which he destroyed the Gandhi statue and spray painted derogatory words.
In October 2023, there was a burglary at a Hindu mandir in Sacramento, California, with six suspects stealing a donation box from the premises, some Hindu groups alleged that the theft was motivated by religious hate. The incident, which took place at the Hari Om Radha Krishna Mandir in Sacramento, was condemned by the Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) as a potential hate crime.
In January 2024, a Hindu temple in California was defaced with pro Khalistan graffiti.

Past objections to Hindu prayers in legislatures
In 2000, the first Hindu opening prayer was offered in the  U.S. Congress by Venkatachalapathi Samuldrala, a priest of Shiva Hindu Temple in Parma, Ohio. This prayer coincides with the visit of Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee to U.S. in 2000. Under the rules of the United States House of Representatives,  Representative Sherrod Brown of Ohio invited a Hindu priest, Samuldrala. This prayer prompted criticism from some conservative Christian groups such as Family Research Council, who protested against it in conservative media, in turn generating responses from their opponents and leading to discussions over the role of legislative chaplains in a pluralist society.
On July 12, 2007, Rajan Zed, a Hindu priest, offered a prayer in the U.S. Senate as its guest priest. The proceedings were interrupted by three self-professed Christian protestors, who were arrested by Capitol Police and charged with a misdemeanor for disrupting Congress. The conservative Christian group American Family Association objected to the prayer, citing the loss of the ""Judeo-Christian foundations"" of the United States.

California textbook protest over Hindu history
In 2005, the Texas-based Vedic Foundation and the American Hindu Education Foundation filed a complaint to California's Curriculum Commission, arguing that the coverage of Indian history and Hinduism in 6th grade history textbooks was biased against Hinduism. Points of contention included a textbook's portrayal of the caste system, the Indo-Aryan migration theory, and the status of women in Indian society.

Caste discrimination
The oppressed castes of South Asia, known as Dalits, form 1.5% of all Indian immigrants to the United States, according to a University of Pennsylvania study carried out in 2003. While a 2019 survey conducted by a Dalit rights group, Equality Labs  claimed that the majority of Dalits living in the US reported facing caste-based harassment at the workplace, the survey results were questioned by the Carnegie Endowment researchers, who pointed out that the study used a non-representative snowball sampling method to identify participants, which might have skewed the results in favor of those with strong views about caste.
In 2021, the student body of California State University system passed a resolution seeking a ban on caste-based discrimination. The campaign was spearheaded by a Nepali origin Dalit student, who came to the US in 2015 escaping social exclusion in his home country, and claimed that he faced discrimination in the US as well. The resolution cited the survey by Equality Labs where a quarter of Dalits reported having faced verbal or physical assaults. Al Jazeera noted that the resolution was backed by students from different racial and religious groups.

Around 2023, several Hindu-American organizations successfully opposed the SB 403 bill, which aimed to introduce caste laws in California that could have unfairly targeted Hindu Americans. In 2023, California legislature proposed a bill to add “caste” under California laws, but the bill was vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom noting that such measure was “unnecessary” because discrimination based on caste was already prohibited in the state, stating that ""California already prohibits discrimination based on sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, gender identity, sexual orientation, and other characteristics"". Many Hindu American groups welcomed Governor's veto as they argued that the proposed bill attempted to unfairly malign their community.

Hindu organizations in America
Several organizations have been formed to combat discrimination against Hindus in the United States and raise issues impacting Hindu Americans. Some of these organizations include:

Hindu American Foundation: HAF is an American Hindu advocacy group founded in 2003 with the broad aim of protecting the rights of Hindus in the United States and raising cultural appropriation issues. Around 2023, HAF was among several Hindu-American organizations that successfully opposed the SB 403 bill, which aimed to introduce caste laws in California that could have unfairly targeted Hindu Americans.
Sadhana: aims to empower Hindu-Americans to live the values of their faith through service, community transformation, and advocacy work.
CoHNA: Coalition of Hindus of North America- Due to CoHNA's activism, Georgia passed a resolution condemning ""Hinduphobia"" in 2023, making it the first state in United States to pass such a resolution.
HinduPACT: The Hindu Policy Research and Advocacy Collective (HinduPACT) is an American Hindu advocacy group with stated aims to monitor acts of hatred towards Hindu Americans while engaging with all Americans to promote Hindu values such as pluralism.

One of the first Baháʼí institutions in the U.S. was established in Chicago and called the Baháʼí Temple Unity, incorporated in 1909 to facilitate the establishment of the first Baháʼí House of Worship in the West, which was eventually built in Wilmette, Illinois and dedicated in 1953. As of 2020 the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies noted the Baháʼí Faith was the largest non-Christian religion in the majority of US counties.
ʻAbdu'l-Bahá became head of the Baháʼí Faith after his father Baha'u'llah (Founder of the religion) died in 1892.

He promoted his father's teachings on peace and unity and consolidated the fledgling western Baháʼí community. After returning from his journey, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá continued corresponding with American Baháʼís, eventually addressing to them a series of letters, or tablets, charging the believers with the task of spreading the religion worldwide. These letters were compiled in Tablets of the Divine Plan.
Following ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's death in 1921, his grandson Shoghi Effendi became the Guardian of the Faith, and continued to encourage and direct the efforts of the American and worldwide Baháʼí community. In 1925, the first National Spiritual Assembly of the United States was formed in conjunction with the Baháʼís of Canada. In 1937, Shoghi Effendi asked believers to begin the systematic implementation of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's vision of teaching the Faith worldwide, calling for American pioneers to assist in establishing Baháʼí communities in the republics of Latin America. Later coordinated efforts, such as the Ten Year Crusade from 1953–63, would see American pioneers sent to a wide variety of locations around the globe.
At the conclusion of the first 7-year Plan in 1944, it was reported that every state in the United States had at least one Local Spiritual Assembly, and the national Baháʼí population was estimated at 4,800. In its 2020 annual report, the National Spiritual Assembly of the 48 contiguous states reported 177,647 registered Baháʼís of all ages, only 77,290 of which had good addresses, and 57,341 total participants in core activities, with 37% of attendees from outside of the Baháʼí population.","The Baháʼí Faith was first mentioned in the United States in 1893 at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago.

In 1937, Shoghi Effendi asked believers to begin the systematic implementation of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's vision of teaching the Faith worldwide, calling for American pioneers to assist in establishing Baháʼí communities in the republics of Latin America. Later coordinated efforts, such as the Ten Year Crusade from 1953–63, would see American pioneers sent to a wide variety of locations around the globe.
At the conclusion of the first 7-year Plan in 1944, it was reported that every state in the United States had at least one Local Spiritual Assembly, and the national Baháʼí population was estimated at 4,800. In its 2020 annual report, the National Spiritual Assembly of the 48 contiguous states reported 177,647 registered Baháʼís of all ages, only 77,290 of which had good addresses, and 57,341 total participants in core activities, with 37% of attendees from outside of the Baháʼí population.

Early history
The first mention of events related to the history of the religion in the United States appears to be the 1845-6 echo of the Nov 1845 London Times story relating events of the Báb upon return from pilgrimage, whom Baháʼís hold as a direct precursor akin to the relationship between John the Baptist and Jesus. In America this was printed in April 1846 in the Boon Lick Times based on an article in the NY Mirror. A mention in 1850 followed. The first academic paper on the religion was a letter written to the American Oriental Society which was holding its meeting in Boston and the library of materials was held at the Boston Athenæum. The letter was originally published as part of the minutes of the Society in The Literary World of June 14, 1851, as an untitled entry whose first quote is ""notice of a singular character, who has for some years past played a prominent part on the stage of Persian life"" dated February 10, 1851 by Dr. Rev. Austin H. Wright. It was subsequently also published in a Vermont newspaper June 26, 1851. In 1893 Rev. Henry Harris Jessup addressed the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago with the first mention the Baháʼí Faith itself in the United States - and published in the Chicago Inter Ocean and manuscript.  Anton Haddad, the first Baháʼí to come to America was already in the country.

First community
Following Haddad, Ibrahim George Kheiralla came to the US and settled in New York where he began to teach ""Truth Seeker"" classes. He visited Charles Augustus Briggs and others, as well as the Syrian community in New York however in 1894 Kheiralla moved on to Chicago following the interest fostered by the World's Columbian Exposition's World Parliament of Religions. One of the early converts while Kheiralla was in Chicago was Thornton Chase, who had read the presentation about the Baháʼís at the Exposition, and is generally considered the first Baháʼí convert in the West.  Other individuals had converted, but none remained members of the religion. Later students of Kheiralla's included Howard MacNutt, who would later compile The Promulgation of Universal Peace, a prominent collection of the addresses of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá during his journeys in America. Both men were designated as ""Disciples of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá"" and ""Heralds of the Covenant"" by Shoghi Effendi. Another student of the classes and Disciple was Lua Getsinger, designated as the ""mother teacher of the West"". Another who ""passed"" the class and joined the religion was the maverick Honoré Jackson. Kheiralla moved once again, to Kenosha, Wisconsin, in 1895, where a large Baháʼí community soon developed.
In 1898, Kheiralla undertook a Baháʼí pilgrimage to Palestine to meet ʻAbdu'l-Bahá with other American pilgrims, including Phoebe Hearst, Lua Getsinger and joined by May Bolles. Kheiralla began making claims of independent leadership and ʻAbdu'l-Bahá sent, first, Anton Haddad with a letter contesting the definition of leadership, then Khieralla's initial teacher of the religion, ʻAbdu'l-Karím-i-Tihrání, to confront him. The conflict made the newspapers. Ultimately unwilling to follow the leadership of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, he was declared a Covenant-breaker.
In the earliest decades of the religion in the country the US the membership had rapid fluctuations that suffered from ill defined community experiences of what membership even meant. It had started with writing individual letters of declaration to 'Abdu'l-Baha but that became less common after 1900.

Green Acre
Meanwhile, to the east, Sarah Farmer had founded Green Acre following the enthusiasm of the same Parliament as a summer center of cross-religion gatherings and cultural development. She had success attracting investors, most especially Phoebe Hearst,: p.193  but by the end of 1899 things were in crisis. According to scholar Eric Leigh Schmidt various people involved were trying to take Green Acre in various directions and threatened the shutdown of the programs: pp.199–200  Creditors were nervous, and her business partners had thought to force Farmer to sell out. While her partners were seeking to meet with her, Farmer was a guest already aboard the SS Fürst Bismarck the first week of January 1900. During the voyage Farmer and Wilson met friends and learned they were on the way to see ʻAbdu'l-Bahá and were asked to come along. Wilson was dubious but eventually the ladies changed their plans and went along.: pp.28, 32  before leaving for Haifa March 23, 1900.: p.29  After converting to the religion on meeting ʻAbdu'l-Bahá Farmer returned to America and began settings plans for the 1901 session at Green Acre. Mírzá Abu'l-Faḍl, among the most scholarly trained Baháʼís of the time, accompanied Anton Haddad returning to America and arrived for the 1901 season.: p.80  Ali Kuli Khan, to serve as his translator, arrived in the United States in June. They had been sent by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. The later well-known Baháʼí Agnes Baldwin Alexander (in 1957, the head of the Baháʼí Faith, Shoghi Effendi, appointed her a Hand of the Cause of God, the highest rank one may hold as an individual Baháʼí), was also there. Out of this the community of Baháʼís began to form in Boston. Farmer and ʻAbdu'l-Bahá began an active exchange of letters some twenty-plus of his which were gathered and printed initially in 1909 and then the third edition in 1919.: p.38

Continued development
That America went through a Civil War and achieved progress toward an emancipation of its black people is pointed at by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá in 1912 as a basis of encouraging respect for America in its support for humanitarian and altruistic ideals. An appeal to the US for humanitarian interest goes as far back as 1867 when Baháʼís wrote a petition to the US Congress because it held no attachment to the present oppressive conditions in Persia. Baháʼu'lláh did himself address the ""Rulers of America and the Presidents of the Republics"" (Ulysses S. Grant was USA President at the time) saying in part ""Bind ye the broken with the hands of justice, and crush the oppressor who flourisheth with the rod of the commandments of your Lord…."" Baháʼís also used diplomatic means to seek redress or relief. In 1901 when the American Baha'i community numbered only roughly 2000 members, they approached the US Ambassador to Persia Herbert W. Bowen in Paris concerning the situation of Baháʼís. As an example of the persecution Baha'is faced (then and now) in Iran, even an American diplomat was murdered in 1924 by a mob on suspicion of being a Baháʼí intervening in a local matter.
In 1906 a government census reported through a scholar that there were 1280 Baháʼís in 24 places among 14 states. Early Baháʼís in this period included reformers and artists like Stanwood Cobb, Louis G. Gregory, and Juliet Thompson. Laura Clifford Barney interviewed ʻAbdu'l-Bahá on several teachings of the religion resulting in the early publication Some Answered Questions. The Baháʼí Temple Unity was incorporated in Chicago at a national convention in 1909 to facilitate the establishment of the first Baháʼí House of Worship in the West; 39 delegates from 36 cities attended. Star of the West was the first large periodical production in the country beginning in March, 1910. Thornton Chase scholar Robert Stockman underscores Chase' importance as an early North American Baháʼí thinker, publicist, administrator, and organizer who is still under appreciated, that ""He is perhaps the only person (in America) before 1912 who had a thorough understanding of the Baháʼí concept of consultation."" Chase was the prime mover behind many of the Chicago's early institutional activities and in many ways his sudden death left a gap in the North American Baháʼí community that remained unfilled until the rise to prominence in the early 1920s of Horace Holley, the chief developer of Baháʼí organization in the United States and Canada.

ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, while head of the religion, visited the United States and Canada, ultimately visiting some 40 cities, to once again spread his father's teachings. He arrived in New York City on 11 April 1912. While he spent most of his time in New York, he visited many cities on the east coast. Then in August he started a more extensive journey across America to the West coast before returning east at the end of October. On 5 December 1912 he set sail back to Europe from New York. During his nine months in North America, he met with many well known people as well as hundreds of American and Canadian Baháʼís who were recent converts to the religion. Accomplishments during the trip include setting examples of the core values of the religion - unity of humanity, and gender equality. First he demonstrated an advanced race-consciousness by glorifying diversity and black individuals on multiple occasions when racial segregation in the United States was the usual practice. And second, extending the progress of the equality of women and men. During his stay in America the lead all-male assembly was dissolved in favor of an integrated one of women and men.
After his return to Palestine in 1913, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá mentioned various lands around the world in which the religion should be introduced, predicted the imminence of World War I, and elaborated the qualities of those who seek to serve the religion. This guidance took the form of a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book Tablets of the Divine Plan. They were translated and presented on April 4, 1919 in New York City, and published in Star of the West on December 12, 1919. Urbain Ledoux also joined the religion about this time. The world-wide activity of Martha Root, who circled the globe three times teaching the Faith, was catalyzed by these Tablets.
The American Baháʼí community went through a shift in the 1910s from a loosely defined community centered on ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's charismatic personality, toward doctrinal uniformity and an emphasis on the Covenant. Confusions on membership existed though larger communities became more stable. For example, following the 1917 national convention, Mason Remey chaired an investigative committee into a study group in Chicago that was mixing the teachings of Baháʼu'lláh with an occult leader, while communications with 'Abdu'l-Baha were cut off. The group members were declared ""violators"" and expelled from the community, and these decisions were confirmed at the national convention of 1918. Nevertheless William Garlington suggests this shift may be why official roles went from around 3,000 in 1916 to half that in 1926.
ʻAbdu'l-Bahá died in November 1921. In his will he appointed his grandson Shoghi Effendi as the Guardian and leader of the religion. A few in America questioned the appointment as early as 1926. Another division occurred because many were attracted to the personality of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá and saw the religion as an ecumenical society to which all persons of goodwill—regardless of religion—might join. When Shoghi Effendi made clear the position that the Baháʼí Faith was an independent religion with its own distinct administration through local and national spiritual assemblies, a few felt that he had overstepped the bounds of his authority; some who actively and continuously caused disunity were expelled by Shoghi Effendi as Covenant-breakers. All of the divisions in this period were short-lived and restricted in their influence, for the most part failing to last beyond the lives of their initial dissidents.

1921–1963
While the first Baháʼí House of Worship of the Americas began taking form in Chicago, national institutional development of the religion shifted to Green Acre for some decades. The Star of the West was replaced with the Baháʼí News in 1924 and supplemented by the magazine World Order in 1935. The first National Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1925 after years of increasing organizational development. See Statistics on National Spiritual Assemblies. Individuals in a number of social situations joined the religion - Alain LeRoy Locke, James Ferdinand Morton Jr., Robert Sengstacke Abbott, Helen Elsie Austin, and Nancy Douglas Bowditch. Additionally, two more institutions were established like Green Acre: the Geyserville school that later moved to become the Bosch Baháʼí School and the Louhelen Baháʼí School.
Gradually from the early 1920s, with the leadership of Shoghi Effendi, membership in the religion was further delineated and its institutions more specifically defined both in methods of election and in jurisdiction. On the one hand it defined local assemblies as nine people elected by people who had formally declared their affiliation and distinct from membership in churches and that the boundaries of jurisdiction were the civil boundaries of the city or town, with jurisdiction at the regional and national level beyond that of local assemblies assigned more clearly to the national organs which were more firm by 1940.: pp.33–4, 38–9  In the 1930s Shoghi Effendi also increased the standardization of avoiding political party affiliations which were progressively applied.: pp.33–4  And since the 1900s and on beyond the 1940s minorities grew in the community - African Americans grew from single digit percentages to the teens, over-represented compared to the states Bahá'ís were present in at the time and rose to higher percentages across the decades, and were integrated into communities successively with an increasing national normative process that may have had an increased sense of hierarchical loyalty instead of community bonds. Though just a member of the community, the young Helen Clevenger was murdered in July 1936 and made international headlines in newspapers, and her story was republished in true crime magazines and retold in radio dramas into 1937, sometimes referencing her status as a Bahá'í, though academic review finds ""…the irony of the case lay in Clevenger membership in the Bahai’i(sic) Faith [who…] were strikingly at odds with most other mainstream religions in their resolute affirmation of human equality. The faith established roots early among African Americans in Washington, D.C. and spread to both blacks and whites in other cities as well. In 1921, the religion’s head, ‘Abdu’l-Baha, asked the various congregations … to begin holding “Race Amity” meetings, where members could openly discuss race and racism. That this occurred in the context of President Woodrow Wilson resegregating the capital city and the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan outside of the former Confederate south is astonishing"".

Bahá'í Historical Record Survey
The Bahá'í Historical Record Survey was an early demographic review of the Bahá'í Faith in the United States and Canada done circa 1934-1936. The backgrounds of Bahá'ís were later studied in a number of ways - racial and ethnic heritage, previous religious background, geographical spread and sometimes how these have changed over the years. Complimentary data sources have also been used to add to some of the reviews including US Census publications and Bahá'í directories published in periodicals of Bahá'í literature.
A couple of these studies look specifically at the burgeoning black population of Bahá'ís amidst the wider society practice of continuing era of social segregation in the American society of the time which was against the Bahá'í teaching of the unity of all humanity. The vast majority of the Bahá'ís were white and mostly elder women, but the black segment of those states Bahá'ís were in responded more to the religion than the white population of those states did. The religion was also initially attracting Protestants, especially Unitarian Universalists and also among other more mainstream liberal denominations, but as history approached 1936 and beyond it attracted a greater diversity of religious backgrounds as it continued to grow more by conversion than by migration or birth.

First Seven Year Plan
Shoghi Effendi, head of the religion after the death of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, wrote a cable on May 1, 1936 to the Baháʼí Annual Convention of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin. In his cable he wrote:

Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá in Tablets of the Divine Plan. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Baháʼí Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Baháʼu'lláh and establish structural basis of His World Order.

Following the May 1 cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent pioneers to be established in all the countries of South American and the Caribbean. The 1936 religious census conducted by the United States government reported 2,584 Baháʼís and by 1944 every state in the nation had at least one local Baháʼí administrative body called a Spiritual Assembly, and a population of about 4,800 Baháʼís was reported. During that period the Baháʼí National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations for international pioneers. In the fall, amidst the rebuilding of the economy in the Great Depression and the build up to World War II a special collection and printing of the scriptural guidance to America was given to President Franklin Roosevelt, ""that these utterances may, in this hour of grave crisis, bring to him comfort, encouragement and strength."" During the 1937 Baháʼí North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Baháʼís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the Baháʼí House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois.  In 1937 the First Seven Year Plan  (1937–44), an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Baháʼís the goal of establishing the Baháʼí Faith in every country in Latin America. In 1937 there was essentially no presence of the religion from Central America south, and eleven states and provinces in the US and Canada had no Baháʼís at all; thirty‑four lacked spiritual assemblies. In 1938 Baháʼí communities and Local Spiritual Assemblies began to form across Latin America with the spread of American Baháʼís, while inside the United States individuals like Guy Murchie, Robert Hayden, Robert B. Powers, joined the religion and others who were raised in the religion achieved increasing levels of service in it like Marion Holley and Dorothy Beecher Baker or otherwise became more well known in the world like Bernard Leach, Carole Lombard, Barbara Hale, Lois Hall and William Sears. In April 1953 the Baháʼí House of Worship (Wilmette, Illinois) was formally dedicated.
During through shortly after WWII the community roughly quadrupled even while the average size of communities dropped from 30 to 15 and 15 became the idealized as able to support various activities like regular Feasts, Holy Day observances, public meetings, assembly meetings. At the same time activities that used to be run by individuals on their own initiative became functions of appointed committees.
Up to 1944, delegates to the national convention were selected based on local assemblies - in 1944 they were elected on the basis of statewide regional conventions of Baháʼís. In 1947, at a time when the Baháʼís number approaching 5000 in America, Baháʼí students at the University of Chicago participated in a demonstration against the segregation and discrimination based on race for medical treatment of students on campus. In 1955 American Baháʼís and institutions spoke up following the destruction of a Baháʼí center of worship in Iran.
From the latter 1940s into the early 1960s the population of Bahá'ís doubled every thirteen years even while the community was sending out pioneers to South America and Europe across the 1930s and 40s.
In 1941, National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States and Canada(NSA) filed a suit in the Supreme court of New York County against Mirza Ahmad Sohrab to stop him from using the name ""Bahá'í"". The judge dismissed the case, stating that, the complaint fails to state a good cause of action. The NSA appealed but the Appellate Court affirmed the decision of the lower court.
Since the 1900s and on beyond the 1940s minorities grew in the community - African Americans grew from single digit percentages to the teens, over-represented compared to the states Bahá'ís were present in at the time, rose to higher percentages across the decades, and were integrated into communities successively with an increasing national normative process that may have had an increased sense of hierarchical loyalty instead of community bonds.

Later developments
Later coordinated efforts, such as the Ten Year Crusade, would see large scale changes in the country - first  pioneers were sent to a wide variety of locations around the globe, such as Africa, some parts of eastern Asia, parts of Oceania/Polynesia filling out the list of first Baháʼís to settle in a country for the plan in a terminology of the  Knights of Baháʼu'lláh. In addition to the international consequences to the plan, initiatives were also started in other arenas. The United States Bahá'ís also had 'subordinate objectives' during the Crusade. One included raising of the total number of Local Spiritual Assemblies to three hundred. This message to the Bahá'í community at the national convention was conveyed by Rúhíyyih Khánum. The principles for the list of goal cities developed was later explained in the national Baha'i News periodical. The National Assembly followed these principles: 

If a state had only one assembly, at least one other town was on the list with priority to preserving that one assembly.
Any goal with no Bahá'í presence was called a 'virgin goal' and otherwise was a 'consolidation goal'. 40 virgin goals were compiled.
If a state had a cluster of assemblies in one area goals was picked in outlying areas of that cluster to ""reduce the immense distances between many Bahá'í communities.""
133 goal cities were developed where groups of at least 4 Bahá'ís lived.
Some goals were developed ""within easy travel"" of established communities so that people who could afford only moving narrowly could do so.
If a community that was not a goal area were to rise to assembly status they would be counted towards the total and that individuals were free to pioneer anywhere but should not expect other pioneers to be coordinated to join them just because they were there.
The Bahá'í directory for 1953-1954 listed 171 local assemblies, 600 locales with groups of 2-8 adult Bahá'ís, and 611 locations with isolated individual Bahá'ís. The first national list of goal cities was published in the Baha'i News in October, 1953. By 1963 there were 331 total assemblies, 649 locations with groups of 2-8 adult Bahá'ís, short of electing an assembly, and 676 locations of isolated Bahá'ís. Before being officially tasked with the work to support the goal some Area Teaching Committees already existed and were in a degree of organization with their own newsletters and conferences by September, 1953. These institutions had existed at least as far back as 1949, sometimes called Regional Teaching Committees. The fact that the Area Teaching Committees were designated central to the achievement of the goal was detailed again in June, 1955.
The US sent about 400 pioneers across the plan to the international goals,: p.153  almost half of whom were women. This was out of a population in the United States of almost 7,000 by 1956 and by 1963 the membership exceeded 10,000, and were increasing by about 1,200 per year. Though there had occasionally been earlier contact with Native American populations, (see for example the story of Nipo T. Strongheart,) this kind of effort was also a point of action during the plan.
As a result of international and intranational changes, eras of activity and waves of growth, the cultural norms in the Baháʼí Faith went through major transitions. The first occurred at about the turn of the 20th century when the religion became known beyond its mainly Muslim Middle-Eastern population and spread to Christian North America and Europe. The second major breakthrough started post-World War II when the religion began to spread rapidly in the villages of the Third World. A stated purpose for the coordinating committees appointed to oversee the process was to facilitate a shift in the balance of roles from North American leading guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin leading guidance and North American cooperation. The process was well underway by 1950 and was to be enforced about 1953. In Africa it was emphasized that western pioneers be self-effacing and focus their efforts not on the colonial leadership but on the native Africans - and that the pioneers must show by actions the sincerity of their sense of service to the Africans in bringing the religion and then the Africans who understand their new religion are to be given freedom to rise up and spread the religion according to their own sensibilities and the pioneers to disperse or step into the background. Similar practices were undertake by Australians arriving in Papua New Guinea. Unlike the spread of Christianity within Indian country in the United States, the Baháʼí Faith has never been associated with a fortification of colonial occupation, Euro-American assimilation, or forced conversions of Native Americans. Indeed in 1960 Hand of the Cause Rúhíyyih Khánum asked for forgiveness for the injustices her race had done and praised the great past of the Native Americans. And in 1963 anthropologist Alice Beck Kehoe, a well known researcher of Native Americans, observed that ""[The Baháʼí Faith] does not deny the validity of native Indian beliefs, [and]...appeals to many Indians who are seeking a religion that is neither exclusively Indian nor dominated by white values and customs,"" though while the religion was growing the challenge of broadening respect also continued to be a point of engagement.

Mason Remey's schism
In 1957 the Baháʼí world came upon a crisis when Shoghi Effendi died without having appointed a successor. The appointed Hands of the Cause organized a way to fill the central leadership until a decision could be made by the Universal House of Justice, which was elected in 1963 and ruled that under the conditions that prevailed, no second Guardian could have been appointed. Prior to the election of the Universal House of Justice, in 1960 one of the Hands, Mason Remey, announced that he was the Guardian and expected the allegiance of the world's Baháʼís. Remey was a prominent member of the American Baháʼí community, having been a contemporary of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá and appointed president of the International Baháʼí Council. His claim was rejected by the Hands of the Cause, and nearly all Baháʼís regarded him as a Covenant-breaker. Remey's division failed to attract sizable following. In 1964 there was a lawsuit and the NSA and won trademark rights. This group splintered and dwindled below 100 members by 2010,: p25  with no communal religious life.

Involvement in Morocco
In the midst of the period leading directly to the election Baháʼís in Morocco had organized their first assembly and begun to suffer persecution. In 1963 the arrest of Baháʼís in Morocco had gotten attention from King Hassan II of Morocco, US Senator Kenneth B. Keating and Roger Nash Baldwin, then Chairman of the International League for the Rights of Man. On March 31, 1963 during a visit to the United States and the United Nations, King Hasan was interviewed on television on Meet the Press, then with Lawrence E. Spivak, and was asked about the treatment of Baháʼís in his own country. He addressed the audience saying that the Baháʼí Faith was not a religion and ""against good order and also morals"". However, on April 2 he makes a public statement that if the Supreme Court confirms the penalty of death that he would grant them a royal pardon. However, on November 23 the Supreme Court heard the appeals and reversed the decision of the lower court. On December 13 the prisoners were  actually released.

Since 1963
In 1964 a project developed among the Baháʼís supporting race unity - the same period as the Freedom Summer campaign - with connections at Louhelen and the burgeoning Baháʼí community of Greenville South Carolina. School integration was going to happen that Fall. Training sessions for a project were noted in the Baháʼí News in August at Louhelen. Some 80 youth attended the training in mid-June and some 26 faculty and staff. After the classes in various subjects 27 went to 8 locations: Greenville, SC, Atlanta, GA, locations in MN, NM, AZ, MI and DC. Six youth went to Greenville, SC, under the sponsorship of their local assembly for a 6 week program joined by five local youth.: 2m38s  They worked on tutoring some 55 blacks students about to attend newly integrating schools, rural proclamation of the religion, and human rights activities focused on the black minority. The work was capped with a parent-teacher banquet reception at a church and a picnic for the students conducted by the Baháʼí teachers. Firesides were held widely in rural areas around Greenville which featured singing, and the group supported petitioning for the public swimming pool being integrated. In 1965 Baháʼís participated in the Selma to Montgomery marches and arranged for telegrams according to the June issue of Baháʼí News. The National Assembly telegrammed the US President and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Eight Baháʼís including two from Montgomery are documented to have participated.
Across the 1960s and 1970s there was a significant suburbanization of the community along with the general society. Populations of Baha'is in major urban centers reduced growth rate and suburban centers and small towns became disproportionately high. Over the same time there were other demographic changes:

a significant influx of youth occurred across the late 1960s and early 1970s across the country.
National minorities grew in proportions in regions - African Americans in the South but also urban centers, Hispanics, East-Asians, and Indians in the Southwest. The news in 1971 was that the national count of Baháʼís had doubled - The Christian Century noted that in a ""one-month, 13-county 'teaching conference' based in Dillon, South Carolina, 9,000 converts, most of them black, joined the Baha'i faith (sic), with hundreds more signing declaration cards in similar efforts throughout the south."" The state with the single largest Baháʼí population was now South Carolina.: 153, 193 
This was followed by a larger demographic change when Persian refugees from the Iranian Revolution of 1978-9 probably adding 15% to the national community though often in just a few urban areas. Overall demographics are not available save to note that the average community size - assembly or not - was about 5 people in 1947 and just over 14 in 1991.
At around 77,000 members in America, in 1982 Baháʼís testified before a Congress subcommittee on the situation in Iran following the Islamic revolution and this was followed up a couple years later, and again in 1988.
Meanwhile the accelerated growth of the worldwide community in the 1960s-1980s yielded a challenge for the social and economic development of communities. According to the Baháʼí teachings, development should increase people's self-reliance, communal solidarity, giving access to knowledge, and, where possible, removing sources of injustice. Spiritual, moral and material development should be linked together. These priorities are envisioned as crucial to the development of world peace. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. The Office of Social and Economic Development was established and Baháʼís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Baháʼí teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Baháʼí socioeconomic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. The Americas as a total held a significant percentage of these. Some examples in the United States:

In 1984 the Center for Interracial Understanding was established in the summer of 1984 at Louhelen.
Another project called a residential college, was founded at Louhelen in September 1985, and was part of its conception. : -42:20  It was announced in March 1986 it was accepting applications for the September 1986 enrollment combining formal study of the religion with a degree earning study at one or two nearby colleges. Students would live and work at the school, receive training, and go to one of these schools.
A temporary effort was that of Tucson Baháʼís aid for 1985 Mexico City earthquake, as there was during and following Hurricane Hugo.
Another programs was for youth called the Baháʼí Youth Workshop founded by Oscar DeGruy in 1974, that had groups organize and perform variously in the United States.
1996 was the beginning of the implementation of the Multi-Racial Unity Living Experience(MRULE) project by Richard Walter Thomas and Jeanne Gazel at Michigan State University, in the wake of the OJ Simpson murder case in Oct 1995.: 4m16s : 2m5s  Thomas was approached by then provost Lou Anna Simon of MSU: 26m  to have a means of resolving racial tensions in the midst of increasing diversity on campus.
The Tahirih Justice Center was founded in 1997 for individuals seeking protection from human rights abuses.
A few communities of Bahá'ís in the country grew to 100s and Los Angeles grew to over one thousand members by the 1980s. In the 1980s the community saw the beginning of a significant increase in supplemental initiatives - special interest groups, academic and professional associations, and newsletters.
The United States Baháʼí administration was party to court cases over trademarks in 2005 and 2008, both of which produced rulings in favor of Baháʼí sects resulting from Mason Remey's schism (see - Ruling on Baháʼí trademarks).

Modern community
In December 1999, the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States stated that out of approximately 140,000 adult (15 and over) members on the rolls, only 70,000 had known addresses, and another estimate was of 137,000 plus Iranian refugees. Nearly 17 percent of US Baháʼís reported being international pioneers, while some 35 percent indicated homefront pioneering experience inside the United States to places the religion had not previously had a presence. The American Religious Identity Survey (ARIS) conducted in 2001, with a sample size of 50,000, estimated that there were 84,000 self-identifying adult (21 and over) Baháʼís in the United States. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated there were some 525,000 Baháʼís in the United States in 2005 however internal counts in Feb 2011 show 175,000 excluding Alaska and Hawaiʻi. Danish researcher, Margit Warburg, stated that the Baháʼí figure reported in World Christian Encyclopedia for the United States is highly exaggerated. Nevertheless as of 2020 the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies noted it as the largest non-Christian religion in the country measured by county.
With developmental roots back into the 19th century, the Ruhi Institute, an educational institution initially operating under the guidance of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʼí Faith in Colombia but has been applied in the United States and studied. The goal is of involving more individuals in study leading to action. A focus of the Institute is to couple an evolving appreciation of virtues with processes of community development. After some decades of development, Baháʼí leadership adopted it as a key component of the evolving nature of Baháʼí life and the culture expressed.
Although a majority of Americans are Christians, Baháʼís make up the second-largest religious group in South Carolina as of May 2014. And based on data from 2010, Baháʼís were the largest minority religion in 80 counties out of the 3143 counties in the country. From the same 2010 data set, the largest populations of Baháʼís at the county-by-county level are in Los Angeles, CA, Palm Beach, FL, Harris County, TX, and Cook County, IL. However on a basis relative to the local population the highest relative density is in South Carolina and Bennett County, SD, especially near the Pine Ridge and Rosebud Indian Reservations, and Georgia. About 3,000 Baháʼís live in the Chicago area.
While early fictional works relating the religion occurred in Europe a number of them have appeared in the United States since the 1980s, sometimes in mass media - see Baháʼí Faith in fiction.

Slowdown in growth
Overall religious membership fell precipitously from 70% to 47% among all Americans from 2000 to 2020. The growth of the American Baháʼí community began to stall around the same time, seeing a 50% drop in enrollments from 1997 to 2007, and a 30% increase in withdrawals in 2006; Sen McGlinn, whose membership was rescinded by the Baháʼí administration, suggested that this could be related to a change in culture in the community and that a significant number of those leaving formally might still identify as Baháʼís. The 2005 annual report by the National Spiritual Assembly noted that growth declined by 60% in the previous 7 years, commenting, ""By our assessment, that the number of annual enrollments has been declining reflects a period of active reassessment and planning for more systematic approaches to growth and retention"" and, ""the decline in growth is transitional."" According to reports by the NSA, they saw 1,198 enrollments in the year to February 2005, 82 child registrations, 271 withdrawals, and 16 reinstatements; In 2009 there were 2,500 enrollments, 1200 child registrations, 322 withdrawals, and 35 reinstatements; and in 2015 there were 616 enrollments, 345 child registrations, 295 withdrawals, and 28 reinstatements.
According to the 2020 Annual Report of the NSA of the Baha'is of the US, there were 526 adult enrollments, 459 deaths and 347 withdrawals during a period of 12 months.

Major centres
Greater Boston
The Baháʼí Faith in Greater Boston, a combined statistical area, has had glimpses of the religion in the 19th century arising to its first community of Baháʼís at the turn of the century. Early newspapers articles on the precursor Bábí religion were followed by a paper by Dr. Rev. Austin H. Wright as an untitled entry whose first quote is ""notice of a singular character, who has for some years past played a prominent part on the stage of Persian life"" dated February 10, 1851. It is considered the first paper giving an account on Bábism. Circa 1900 the community began to coalesce being near to Greenacre, an interfaith retreat early on. From then on the institution would progressively be associated with Baháʼís - a place where both locals and people from afar came to learn of the religion, and who officially took over controlling interest from 1913 following the wishes and controlling interest of its founder. Leaders rising to national prominence with a national level of organization soon arose after ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, traveled through the area. Most prominent were from the area were Harlan Ober, William Henry Randall, and Alfred E. Lunt. Broadening recognitions of the community sometimes took the form of publicly noting their persecution in Morocco and then Iran, and presence in local concerts and fairs. In 1988 the national assembly of the United States picked Boston among its four foci for expansion of the religion and a conference of some 800 Baháʼís gathered.: 193–195, 242–245  The modern community, albeit a tiny fraction of the wider population, is present in some concentrations and thin areas throughout the greater Boston area. Over the last couple decades, it has been systematically pursuing programs of neighborhood community building activities of study circles, children's classes, junior youth groups, and devotional meetings among the activities and observances of the religion.

South Carolina
The Baháʼí Faith in South Carolina begins in the transition from Jim Crow to the Civil Rights Movement but defines another approach to the problem, and proceeded according to its teachings. The first mention in relation to the history of the religion came in the 1860s in a newspaper article. Following this the first individual from South Carolina to find the religion was Louis Gregory in 1909, followed by individuals inside the state. Communities of Baháʼís were soon operating in North Augusta, Columbia and Greenville struggled with segregation culture through the 1950s externally and internally. However, in the 1969-1973 period, a very remarkable and somewhat unsustainable period of conversions to the religion on the basis of a meeting of Christian and Baháʼí religious ideas established a basis of community across several counties - notably Marion, Williamsburg, and Dillon, served by the Louis Gregory Institute and its radio station WLGI but also across the wider area. That community continues and has gathered news coverage as part of the second largest religion in South Carolina.

Alaska
Alaska is unusual in that it is not an independent nation recognized by the United Nations, and yet has a National Spiritual Assembly. Its specific statistics are not published, and are often not broken out in non-Baháʼí statistics of the US in general.

Hawaiʻi
The Baháʼí community in Hawaiʻi had its origins when Hawaiian-born Agnes Alexander, who became a Baháʼí in Paris in 1900, returned to the islands in 1901. Similar to Alaska, the Baháʼís of Hawaiʻi have an independent National Spiritual Assembly from that of the US, though it is itself one of the 50 United States. Independent statistics have not been published.

Criticism
Juan Cole was an American Baháʼí professor of history who resigned from the religion in 1996 after conflicts with the Baháʼís. Cole went on to critically attack the Baháʼí Faith in several books and articles written from 1998-2000, describing a prominent Baháʼí as ""inquisitor"" and ""bigot"", and describing Baháʼí institutions as socially isolating, dictatorial, and controlling, and with financial irregularities. Soon after his resignation, Cole created an email list and website called H-Bahai, which became a repository of both primary source material and critical analysis on the religion.

Notable American Baháʼís
Outside the religion in general society prominent Baháʼís have been social and civic leaders Alain LeRoy Locke, Patricia Locke, Dorothy Wright Nelson and Layli Miller-Muro, entertainers Seals and Crofts, Dizzy Gillespie, Rainn Wilson, Andy Grammer and among academics Suheil Bushrui, and Dwight W. Allen. See List of Baháʼís for many other Baháʼís that have Wikipedia articles about them, and more generally Category:American Bahá'ís. Such prominence does not connote authority or priority within the religion but simply a degree of public recognition. William Sears was a sports commentator and television personality, and Louis Gregory was an African-American lawyer, and both become prominent inside the religion as Hands of the Cause. Locke and Nelson were elected to the National Spiritual Assembly.

The Epistles of Wisdom is the foundational and central text of the Druze faith. The Druze faith originated in Isma'ilism (a branch of Shia Islam), and has been influenced by a diverse range of traditions, including Christianity, Gnosticism, Neoplatonism, Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, Pythagoreanism. This has led to the development of a distinct and secretive theology, characterized by an esoteric interpretation of scripture that emphasizes the importance of the mind and truthfulness.

The Druze hold Shuaib in high regard, believing him to be the same person as the biblical Jethro. They regard Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, and the Isma'ili Imam Muhammad ibn Isma'il as prophets.

Etymology
The name Druze is derived from the name of Muhammad bin Ismail Nashtakin ad-Darazī (from Persian darzi, ""seamster"") who was an early preacher. Although the Druze consider ad-Darazī a heretic, the name has been used to identify them, possibly by their historical opponents as a way to attach their community with ad-Darazi's poor reputation.
Before becoming public, the movement was secretive and held closed meetings in what was known as Sessions of Wisdom. During this stage a dispute occurred between ad-Darazi and Hamza bin Ali mainly concerning ad-Darazi's ghuluww (""exaggeration""), which refers to the belief that God was incarnated in human beings to ad-Darazi naming himself ""The Sword of the Faith"", which led Hamza to write an epistle refuting the need for the sword to spread the faith and several epistles refuting the beliefs of the ghulat.
In 1016 ad-Darazi and his followers openly proclaimed their beliefs and called people to join them, causing riots in Cairo against the Unitarian movement including Hamza bin Ali and his followers. This led to the suspension of the movement for one year and the expulsion of ad-Darazi and his supporters.
Although the Druze religious books describe ad-Darazi as the ""insolent one"" and as the ""calf"" who is narrow-minded and hasty, the name ""Druze"" is still used for identification and for historical reasons. In 1018, ad-Darazi was assassinated for his teachings; some sources claim that he was executed by Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah.
Some authorities see in the name ""Druze"" a descriptive epithet, derived from Arabic dārisah (""she who studies""). Others have speculated that the word comes from the Persian word Darazo (درز ""bliss"") or from Shaykh Hussayn ad-Darazī, who was one of the early converts to the faith. In the early stages of the movement, the word ""Druze"" is rarely mentioned by historians, and in Druze religious texts only the word Muwaḥḥidūn (""Unitarian"") appears. The only early Arab historian who mentions the Druze is the eleventh century Christian scholar Yahya of Antioch, who clearly refers to the heretical group created by ad-Darazī, rather than the followers of Hamza ibn 'Alī. As for Western sources, Benjamin of Tudela, the Jewish traveler who passed through Lebanon in or around 1165, was one of the first European writers to refer to the Druze by name. The word Dogziyin (""Druzes"") occurs in an early Hebrew edition of his travels, but it is clear that this is a scribal error. Be that as it may, he described the Druze as ""mountain dwellers, monotheists, who believe in 'soul eternity' and reincarnation"". He also stated that ""they loved the Jews"".

Location
The number of Druze people worldwide is between 800,000 and one million, with the vast majority residing in the Levant. The primary countries with Druze populations are Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan.
According to the Institute of Druze Studies, as of 1998, approximately 40–50% of Druze live in Syria, 30–40% in Lebanon, 6–7% in Israel, and 1–2% in Jordan. About 2% of the Druze are scattered across other Middle Eastern countries, and there were approximately 20,000 Druze in the United States at that time. Scholar Colbert C. Held from the University of Nebraska, Lincoln estimates that the global Druze population is around 1 million. He notes that about 45% to 50% live in Syria, 35% to 40% live in Lebanon, and less than 10% live in Israel. Recently, there has been a growing Druze diaspora.
Outside the Middle East, significant Druze communities exist in Australia, Canada, Europe, Latin America (mainly Venezuela, Colombia and Brazil), the United States, and West Africa. They are Arabs who speak Levantine Arabic and follow a social pattern very similar to those of the other peoples of the Levant (eastern Mediterranean). In 2021 the largest Druze communities outside the Middle East are in Venezuela, with approximately 60,000, and in the United States, with around 50,000. In 2017, the Los Angeles Times reported about 30,000 Druze in the United States, with the largest concentration in Southern California.

History
Early history
The story of the creation of the Druze faith in the days between 1017 and 1018 is dominated by three men and their struggle for influence.

Hamza ibn Ali ibn Ahmad was an Ismaili mystic and scholar from Khorasan, who arrived in Fatimid Egypt in 1014 or 1016 and began to preach a Muwaḥḥidūn (""Unitarian"") doctrine.
al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, the sixth Fātimid caliph, became a central figure in the faith being preached by Hamza ibn Ali ibn Ahmad.
Muhammad bin Ismail Nashtakin ad-Darazi arrived in Cairo in 1015 or 1017, possibly from Bukhara, joined the movement and became an important preacher.

Hamza ibn Ali ibn Ahmad arrives in Cairo
Hamza ibn Ali ibn Ahmad, an Ismaili mystic and scholar from Zozan, Khorasan, in the Samanid Empire. arrived in Fatimid Egypt in 1014 or 1016. He assembled a group of scholars that met regularly in the Raydan Mosque, near the Al-Hakim Mosque. In 1017, Hamza began to preach a Muwaḥḥidūn (Unitarian) doctrine.
Hamza gained the support of the Fātimid caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, who issued a decree promoting religious freedom and eventually became a central figure in the Druze faith.

al-Darazi arrives in Cairo
Little is known about the early life of al-Darazi. According to most sources, he was born in Bukhara. He is believed to have been of Persian origins and his title al-Darazi is Persian in origin, meaning ""the tailor"". He arrived in Cairo in 1015, or 1017, after which he joined the newly emerged Druze movement.
Al-Darazi was converted early to the Unitarian faith and became one of its early preachers. At that time, the movement enlisted a large number of adherents. As the number of his followers grew, he became obsessed with his leadership and gave himself the title ""The Sword of the Faith"". Al-Darazi argued that he should be the leader of the daʻwah rather than Hamza ibn Ali and gave himself the title ""Lord of the Guides"" because Caliph al-Hakim referred to Hamza as ""Guide of the Consented"". It is said that al-Darazi allowed wine, forbidden marriages and taught metempsychosis although this may be exaggeration by contemporary and later historians and polemicists.
This attitude led to disputes between Ad-Darazi and Hamza ibn Ali, who disliked his behavior and his arrogance. In the Epistles of Wisdom, Hamza ibn Ali ibn Ahmad warns al-Darazi, saying, ""Faith does not need a sword to aid it"", but al-Darazi ignored Hamza's warnings and continued to challenge the Imam.

al-Darazi issues the unitarian call
The divine call or unitarian call is the Druze period of time that was opened at sunset on Thursday, 30 May 1017 by Ad-Darazi. The call summoned people to a true unitarian belief that removed all attributes (wise, just, outside, inside, etc.) from God. It promoted absolute monotheism and the concepts of supporting your fellow man, true speech and pursuit of oneness with God. These concepts superseded all ritual, law and dogma and requirements for pilgrimage, fasting, holy days, prayer, charity, devotion, creed and particular worship of any prophet or person was downplayed. Sharia was opposed and Druze traditions started during the call continue today, such as meeting for reading, prayer and social gathering on a Thursday instead of a Friday at Khalwats instead of mosques. Such gatherings and traditions were not compulsory and people were encouraged to pursue a state of compliance with the real law of nature governing the universe. Epistle thirteen of the Epistles of Wisdom called it ""A spiritual doctrine without any ritualistic imposition"".
The time of the call was seen as a revolution of truth, with missionaries preaching its message all around the Middle East. These messengers were sent out with the Druze epistles and took written vows from believers, whose souls are thought to still exist in the Druze of today. The souls of those who took the vows during the call are believed to be continuously reincarnating in successive generations of Druze until the return of al-Hakim to proclaim a second Divine call and establish a Golden Age of justice and peace for all.

al-Darazi is executed
By 1018, al-Darazi had gathered around him partisans—""Darazites""—who believed that universal reason became incarnated in Adam at the beginning of the world, was then passed to the prophets, then into Ali, and then into his descendants, the Fatimid Caliphs. Al-Darazi wrote a book laying out this doctrine, but when he read from his book in the principal mosque in Cairo, it caused riots and protests against his claims and many of his followers were killed.
Hamza ibn Ali rejected al-Darazi's ideology, calling him ""the insolent one and Satan"". The controversy led Caliph al-Hakim to suspend the Druze daʻwah in 1018.
In an attempt to gain the support of al-Hakim, al-Darazi started preaching that al-Hakim and his ancestors were the incarnation of God. An inherently modest man, al-Hakim did not believe that he was God, and felt al-Darazi was trying to depict himself as a new prophet. In 1018 Al-Hakim had al-Darazi executed, leaving Hamza the sole leader of the new faith and al-Darazi considered to be a renegade.

Disappearance of Al-Hakim
Al-Hakim disappeared one night while on his evening ride—presumably assassinated, perhaps at the behest of his formidable elder sister Sitt al-Mulk. The Druze believe he went into Occultation with Hamza ibn Ali and three other prominent preachers, leaving the care of the ""Unitarian missionary movement"" to a new leader, al-Muqtana Baha'uddin.
The call was suspended briefly between 19 May 1018 and 9 May 1019 during the apostasy of al-Darazi and again between 1021 and 1026 during a period of persecution by the Fatimid caliph al-Zahir li-I'zaz Din Allah for those who had sworn the oath to accept the call.
Persecutions started forty days after the disappearance into Occultation of al-Hakim, who was thought to have been converting people to the Unitarian faith for over twenty years prior. Al-Hakim convinced some heretical followers such as al-Darazi of his soteriological divinity and officially declared the Divine call after issuing a decree promoting religious freedom.
Al-Hakim was replaced by his underage son, al-Zahir li-I'zaz Din Allah. The Unitarian/Druze movement acknowledged al-Zahir as the caliph but continued to regard Hamzah as its Imam. The young caliph's regent, Sitt al-Mulk, ordered the army to destroy the movement in 1021. At the same time, Bahāʼ al-Dīn was assigned the leadership of the Unitarians by Hamza.
For the next seven years, the Druze faced extreme persecution by al-Zahir li-I'zaz Din Allah, who wanted to eradicate the faith. This was the result of a power struggle inside of the Fatimid Calphate, in which the Druze were viewed with suspicion because they refused to recognize the new caliph as their Imam.
Many spies, mainly the followers of al-Darazi, joined the Unitarian movement to infiltrate the Druze community. The spies set about agitating trouble and soiling the reputation of the Druze. This resulted in friction with the new caliph who clashed militarily with the Druze community. The clashes ranged from Antioch to Alexandria, where tens of thousands of Druze were slaughtered by the Fatimid army, ""this mass persecution known by the Druze as the period of the mihna"". The largest massacre was at Antioch, where 5000 prominent Druze were killed, followed by that of Aleppo. As a result, the faith went underground, in hope of survival, as those captured were either forced to renounce their faith or be killed. Druze survivors ""were found principally in southern Lebanon and Syria"".
In 1038, two years after the death of al-Zahir li-I'zaz Din Allah, the Druze movement was able to resume because the new leadership that replaced him had friendly political ties with at least one prominent Druze leader.

Closing of the unitarian call
In 1043, Baha al-Din al-Muqtana declared that the sect would no longer accept new pledges, and since that time proselytism has been prohibited awaiting al-Hakim's return at the Last Judgment to usher in a new Golden Age.
Some Druze and non-Druze scholars like Samy Swayd and Sami Makarem state that this confusion is due to confusion about the role of the early preacher al-Darazi, whose teachings the Druze rejected as heretical. These sources assert that al-Hakim rejected al-Darazi's claims of divinity, and ordered the elimination of his movement while supporting that of Hamza ibn Ali.

During the Crusades
Wadi al-Taym, in Lebanon, was one of the two most important centers of Druze missionary activity in the 11th century and was the first area where the Druze appeared in the historical record under the name ""Druze"". It is generally considered the birthplace of the Druze faith.
It was during the period of Crusader rule in Levant (1099–1291) that the Druze first emerged into the full light of history in the Gharb region of the Chouf. As powerful warriors serving the leaders in Damascus against the Crusades, the Druze were given the task of keeping watch over the Crusaders in the seaport of Beirut, to prevent them from making any encroachments inland. Subsequently, the Druze chiefs of the Gharb placed their considerable military experience at the disposal of the Mamluk sultans in Egypt (1250–1516); first, to assist them in putting an end to what remained of Crusader rule in the coastal Levant, and later to help them safeguard the Lebanese coast against Crusader retaliation by sea.
In the early period of the Crusader era, the Druze feudal power was in the hands of two families, the Tanukhs and the Arslans. From their fortresses in the Gharb area (now in Aley District of southern Mount Lebanon Governorate), the Tanukhs led their incursions into the Phoenician coast and finally succeeded in holding Beirut and the marine plain against the Franks. Because of their fierce battles with the Crusaders, the Druze earned the respect of the Sunni caliphs and thus gained important political powers.
After the middle of the twelfth century, the Maan family superseded the Tanukhs in Druze leadership. The origin of the family goes back to Prince Ma'an, who made his appearance in Lebanon in the days of the Abbasid caliph al-Mustarshid (1118–35). The Ma'ans chose for their abode the Chouf in south-western Lebanon (southern Mount Lebanon Governorate), overlooking the maritime plain between Beirut and Sidon, and made their headquarters in Baaqlin, which is still a leading Druze village. They were invested with feudal authority by Sultan Nur ad-Din Zengi and furnished respectable contingents to the Muslim ranks in their struggle against the Crusaders.
Certain aspects of the faith, such as transmigration of souls between adherents and incarnation, were viewed as heretical or kufr (infidelity) and foreign by Sunni and Shia Muslims, but contributed to solidarity among the Druze, who closed their religion to new converts in 1046 due to the threat of persecution. The proto-Salafi thinker ibn Taymiyya believed the Druze had a high level of infidelity besides being apostates. Thus, they were not trustworthy and should not be forgiven. He taught also that Muslims cannot accept Druze penitence nor keep them alive, and that Druze property should be confiscated and their women enslaved.
Having cleared the Holy Land of the Crusaders, the Mamluk Sultanate now turned their attention to the schismatic Muslims of Syria. In 1305, after the issuing of a fatwa by the scholar ibn Taymiyya calling for jihad against all non-Sunni Muslim groups like the Druze, Alawites, Isma'ilis, and Twelver Shi'a, al-Nasir Muhammad inflicted a disastrous defeat on the Druze at Keserwan, and forced outward compliance on their part to Sunnism. The Sunni Mamluk campaigns led to the destruction of many Christian churches and monasteries and Druze sanctuaries khilwat, and caused mass destruction of Maronite and Druze villages and the killings and mass displacement of its inhabitants. Lebanese Sunni authors generally write of the campaigns from a pro-Mamluk stance, seeing in them the legitimate Muslim state's efforts to incorporate Mount Lebanon into the Islamic realm, while Druze authors write with a focus on the Druze community's consistent connection to Mount Lebanon and defense of its practical autonomy.
Later, the Druze were severely attacked at Saoufar in the 1585 Ottoman expedition against the Druze after the Ottomans claimed that the Druze had assaulted their caravans near Tripoli. As a result of the Ottoman experience with the rebellious Druze, the word Durzi in Turkish came, and continues, to mean someone who is the ultimate thug.
The 16th and 17th centuries witnessed a succession of armed Druze rebellions against the Ottomans countered by repeated Ottoman punitive expeditions against the Chouf, in which the Druze population of the area was severely depleted and many villages destroyed. These military measures, severe as they were, did not succeed in reducing the local Druze to the required degree of subordination. This led the Ottoman government to agree to an arrangement whereby the different nahiyahs (districts) of the Chouf would be granted in iltizam (""fiscal concession"") to one of the region's amirs, or leading chiefs, leaving the maintenance of law and order and the collection of taxes in the area in the hands of the appointed amir. This arrangement was to provide the cornerstone for the privileged status ultimately enjoyed by the whole of Mount Lebanon, Druze and Christian areas alike.

Ma'an dynasty
With the advent of the Ottoman Turks and the conquest of Syria by Sultan Selim I in 1516, the Ma'ans were acknowledged by the new rulers as the feudal lords of southern Lebanon. Druze villages spread and prospered in that region, which under Ma'an leadership so flourished that it acquired the generic term of Jabal Bayt-Ma'an (the mountain home of the Ma'an) or Jabal al-Druze. The latter title has since been usurped by the Hawran region, which since the middle of the 19th century has proven a haven of refuge to Druze emigrants from Lebanon and has become the headquarters of Druze power.
Under Fakhr-al-Dīn II (Fakhreddin II), the Druze dominion increased until it included Lebanon-Phoenicia and almost all Syria, extending from the edge of the Antioch plain in the north to Safad in the south, with a part of the Syrian desert dominated by Fakhr-al-Din's castle at Tadmur (Palmyra), the ancient capital of Zenobia. The ruins of this castle still stand on a steep hill overlooking the town. Fakhr-al-Din became too strong for his Turkish sovereign in Constantinople. He went so far in 1608 as to sign a commercial treaty with Duke Ferdinand I of Tuscany containing secret military clauses. The Sultan then sent a force against him, and he was compelled to flee the land and seek refuge in the courts of Tuscany and Naples in 1613 and 1615 respectively.
In 1618, political changes in the Ottoman sultanate had resulted in the removal of many enemies of Fakhr-al-Din from power, signaling the prince's triumphant return to Lebanon soon afterwards. Through a clever policy of bribery and warfare, he extended his domains to cover all of modern Lebanon, some of Syria and northern Galilee.
In 1632, Küçük Ahmed Pasha was named Lord of Damascus. Küçük Ahmed Pasha was a rival of Fakhr-al-Din and a friend of the sultan Murad IV, who ordered the pasha and the sultanate's navy to attack Lebanon and depose Fakhr-al-Din.
This time the prince decided to remain in Lebanon and resist the offensive, but the death of his son Ali in Wadi al-Taym was the beginning of his defeat. He later took refuge in Jezzine's grotto, closely followed by Küçük Ahmed Pasha who eventually caught up with him and his family.

Fakhr-al-Din was captured, taken to Istanbul, and imprisoned with two of his sons in the infamous Yedi Kule prison. The Sultan had Fakhr-al-Din and his sons killed on 13 April 1635 in Istanbul, bringing an end to an era in the history of Lebanon, which would not regain its current boundaries until it was proclaimed a mandate state and republic in 1920. One version recounts that the younger son was spared, raised in the harem and went on to become Ottoman Ambassador to India.
Fakhr-al-Din II was the first ruler in modern Lebanon to open the doors of his country to foreign Western influences. Under his auspices the French established a khān (hostel) in Sidon, the Florentines a consulate, and Christian missionaries were admitted into the country. Beirut and Sidon, which Fakhr-al-Din II beautified, still bear traces of his benign rule. See the new biography of this Prince, based on original sources, by TJ Gorton: Renaissance Emir: a Druze Warlord at the Court of the Medici (London, Quartet Books, 2013), for an updated view of his life.
Fakhr ad Din II was succeeded in 1635 by his nephew Mulhim Ma'n, who ruled through his death in 1658. (Fakhr ad Din's only surviving son, Husayn, lived the rest of his life as a court official in Constantinople.) Emir Mulhim exercised Iltizam taxation rights in the Shuf, Gharb, Jurd, Matn, and Kisrawan districts of Lebanon. Mulhim's forces battled and defeated those of Mustafa Pasha, Beylerbey of Damascus, in 1642, but he is reported by historians to have been otherwise loyal to Ottoman rule.
Following Mulhim's death, his sons Ahmad and Korkmaz entered into a power struggle with other Ottoman-backed Druze leaders. In 1660, the Ottoman Empire moved to reorganize the region, placing the sanjaks (districts) of Sidon-Beirut and Safed in a newly formed province of Sidon, a move seen by local Druze as an attempt to assert control. Contemporary historian Istifan al-Duwayhi reports that Korkmaz was killed in act of treachery by the Beylerbey of Damascus in 1662. Ahmad however emerged victorious in the power struggle among the Druze in 1667, but the Maʿnīs lost control of Safad and retreated to controlling the iltizam of the Shuf mountains and Kisrawan. Ahmad continued as local ruler through his death from natural causes, without heir, in 1697.
During the Ottoman–Habsburg War (1683–1699), Ahmad Ma'n collaborated in a rebellion against the Ottomans which extended beyond his death. Iltizam rights in Shuf and Kisrawan passed to the rising Shihab family through female-line inheritance.

Shihab Dynasty
As early as the days of Saladin, and while the Ma'ans were still in complete control over southern Lebanon, the Shihab tribe, originally Hijaz Arabs, but later settled in Ḥawran, advanced from Ḥawran, in 1172, and settled in Wadi al-Taym at the foot of mount Hermon. They soon made an alliance with the Ma'ans and were acknowledged as the Druze chiefs in Wadi al-Taym. At the end of the 17th century (1697) the Shihabs succeeded the Ma'ans in the feudal leadership of Druze southern Lebanon, although they reportedly professed Sunni Islam, they showed sympathy with Druze, the religion of the majority of their subjects.
The Shihab leadership continued until the middle of the 19th century and culminated in the illustrious governorship of Amir Bashir Shihab II (1788–1840) who, after Fakhr-al-Din, was the most powerful feudal lord Lebanon produced. Though governor of the Druze Mountain, Bashir was a crypto-Christian, and it was he whose aid Napoleon solicited in 1799 during his campaign against Syria. The ""Druze-Christian alliance"" during this century was the major factor enabling the Shehab dynasty to maintain power.
Having consolidated his conquests in Syria (1831–1838), Ibrahim Pasha, son of the viceroy of Egypt, Muhammad Ali Pasha, made the fatal mistake of trying to disarm the Christians and Druze of the Lebanon and to draft the latter into his army. This was contrary to the principles of the life of independence which these mountaineers had always lived, and resulted in a general uprising against Egyptian rule. The Druze of Wadi al-Taym and Ḥawran, under the leadership of Shibli al-Aryan, distinguished themselves in their stubborn resistance at their inaccessible headquarters, al-Laja, lying southeast of Damascus.

Qaysites and the Yemenites
The conquest of Syria by the Muslim Arabs in the middle of the seventh century introduced into the land two political factions later called the Qaysites and the Yemenites. The Qaysite party represented the Bedouin Arabs who were regarded as inferior by the Yemenites who were earlier and more cultured emigrants into Syria from southern Arabia. Druze and Christians grouped in political, rather than religious, parties; the party lines in Lebanon obliterated ethnic and religious lines and the people grouped themselves into one or the other of these two parties regardless of their religious affiliations. The sanguinary feuds between these two factions depleted, in course of time, the manhood of the Lebanon and ended in the decisive battle of Ain Dara in 1711, which resulted in the utter defeat of the Yemenite party. Many Yemenite Druze thereupon migrated to the Hauran region, laying the foundation of Druze power there.
The Qays were led by Emir Haydar of the Shihab dynasty and consisted of the Druze clans of Jumblatt, Talhuq, Imad and Abd al-Malik and the Maronite clan of Khazen. The Yamani faction was led by Mahmoud Abu Harmoush and consisted of the Druze Alam al-Din, Arslan and Sawaf clans. The Yamani faction also had backing from the Ottoman provincial authorities of Sidon and Damascus. The battle ended in a rout of the Yamani faction and resulted in the consolidation of Qaysi political and fiscal domination over Mount Lebanon. The battle's outcome also precipitated a mass migration of pro-Yamani Druze nobility and peasants from Mount Lebanon to the eastern Hauran, in a mountainous area today known as Jabal al-Druze. This area had seen previous waves of Druze migration starting in 1685. Consequently, the Maronite Christian population in Mount Lebanon became the dominant group. The Yamani Druze exodus significantly contributed to a demographic shift in Mount Lebanon, with Maronites and other Christians, namely from the Greek Orthodox and Melkite sects, making up a large share of the population at the expense of the Druze.

Civil conflict of 1860
The relationship between the Druze and Christians has been characterized by harmony and coexistence, with amicable relations between the two groups prevailing throughout history, with the exception of some periods, including 1860 civil conflict in Mount Lebanon and Damascus. In 1840, social disturbance started between Druze and their Christian Maronite neighbors, who had previously been on friendly terms. This culminated in the civil war of 1860.
After the Shehab dynasty converted to Christianity, some prominent Druze families, including the Druze Abi-Lamma clan—who were close allies of the Shihabs—also converted to Christianity and joined the Maronite Church. The Druze community and feudal leaders came under attack from the regime with the collaboration of the Maronite Catholic Church, and the Druze lost most of their political and feudal powers. Also, the Druze formed an alliance with Britain and allowed Protestant missionaries to enter Mount Lebanon, creating tension between them and the Catholic Maronites.
The Maronite-Druze conflict in 1840–60 was an outgrowth of the Maronite independence movement, directed against the Druze, Druze feudalism, and the Ottoman-Turks. The civil war was not therefore a religious war, except in Damascus, where it spread and where the vastly non-Druze population was anti-Christian. This animosity was fueled by economic disparities, with Christians, who were generally wealthier and more prosperous, compare to the economically struggling Muslim residents. The movement culminated with the 1859–60 massacre and defeat of the Maronites by the Druze. The civil war of 1860 cost the Maronites some ten thousand lives in Damascus, Zahlé, Deir al-Qamar, Hasbaya, and other towns of Lebanon.
The European powers then determined to intervene, and authorized the landing in Beirut of a body of French troops under General Beaufort d'Hautpoul, whose inscription can still be seen on the historic rock at the mouth of Nahr al-Kalb. French intervention on behalf of the Maronites did not help the Maronite national movement, since France was restricted in 1860 by the British government, which did not want the Ottoman Empire dismembered. But European intervention pressured the Turks to treat the Maronites more justly. Following the recommendations of the powers, the Ottoman Porte granted Lebanon local autonomy, guaranteed by the powers, under a Maronite governor. This autonomy was maintained until World War I.
The Maronite Catholics and the Druze founded modern Lebanon in the early eighteenth century, through the ruling and social system known as the ""Maronite-Druze dualism"" which developed in Ottoman-era Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, creating one of the calmest atmospheres that Lebanon had ever lived in. The ruling and social system in the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate was formed from the Maronite-Druze dualism, and the security stability and Druze-Maronite coexistence in the Mutasarrifate allowed the development of the economy and the system of government.

Rebellion in Hauran
The Hauran rebellion was a violent Druze uprising against Ottoman authority in the Syrian province, which erupted in May 1909. The rebellion was led by al-Atrash family, originated in local disputes and Druze unwillingness to pay taxes and conscript into the Ottoman Army. The rebellion ended in brutal suppression of the Druze by General Sami Pasha al-Farouqi, significant depopulation of the Hauran region and execution of the Druze leaders in 1910. In the outcome of the revolt, 2,000 Druze were killed, a similar number wounded, and hundreds of Druze fighters imprisoned. Al-Farouqi also disarmed the population, extracted significant taxes, and launched a census of the region.

Modern history
In Lebanon, Syria, Israel, and Jordan, the Druzites have official recognition as a separate religious community with its own religious court system.
Although most Druze no longer consider themselves Muslim, Al Azhar of Egypt recognized them in 1959 as one of the Islamic sects in the Al-Azhar Shia Fatwa due to political reasons, as Gamal Abdel Nasser saw it as a tool to spread his appeal and influence across the entire Arab world.
The Druze religion does not endorse separatism, and urges blending with the communities they reside in; the Druze have often done so to avoid persecution. Yet the Druze also have a history of resistance to occupying powers, and they have at times enjoyed more freedom than most other groups living in the Levant.

In Syria
In Syria, most Druzites live in the Jebel al-Druze, a rugged and mountainous region in the southwest of the country, which is more than 90 percent Druze inhabited; some 120 villages are exclusively so. Other notable communities live in the Harim Mountains, the Damascus suburb of Jaramana, and on the southeast slopes of Mount Hermon. A large Syrian Druze community historically lived in the Golan Heights, but following wars with Israel in 1967 and 1973, many of these Druze fled to other parts of Syria; most of those who remained live in a handful of villages in the disputed zone, while only a few live in the narrow remnant of Quneitra Governorate that is still under effective Syrian control.

The Druze always played a far more important role in Syrian politics than its comparatively small population would suggest. With a community of little more than 100,000 in 1949, or roughly three percent of the Syrian population, the Druze of Syria's southwestern mountains constituted a potent force in Syrian politics and played a leading role in the nationalist struggle against the French. Under the military leadership of Sultan Pasha al-Atrash, the Druze provided much of the military force behind the Syrian Revolution of 1925–27. In 1945, Amir Hasan al-Atrash, the paramount political leader of the Jebel al-Druze, led the Druze military units in a successful revolt against the French, making the Jebel al-Druze the first and only region in Syria to liberate itself from French rule without British assistance. At independence the Druze, made confident by their successes, expected that Damascus would reward them for their many sacrifices on the battlefield. They demanded to keep their autonomous administration and many political privileges accorded them by the French and sought generous economic assistance from the newly independent government.

When a local paper in 1945 reported that President Shukri al-Quwatli (1943–49) had called the Druze a ""dangerous minority"", Sultan Pasha al-Atrash flew into a rage and demanded a public retraction. If it were not forthcoming, he announced, the Druze would indeed become ""dangerous"", and a force of 4,000 Druze warriors would ""occupy the city of Damascus"". Quwwatli could not dismiss Sultan Pasha's threat. The military balance of power in Syria was tilted in favor of the Druze, at least until the military build up during the 1948 War in Palestine. One advisor to the Syrian Defense Department warned in 1946 that the Syrian army was ""useless"", and that the Druze could ""take Damascus and capture the present leaders in a breeze"".
During the four years of Adib Shishakli's rule in Syria (December 1949 to February 1954) (on 25 August 1952: Adib al-Shishakli created the Arab Liberation Movement (ALM), a progressive party with pan-Arabist and socialist views), the Druze community was subjected to a heavy attack by the Syrian government. Shishakli believed that among his many opponents in Syria, the Druze were the most potentially dangerous, and he was determined to crush them. He frequently proclaimed: ""My enemies are like a serpent: The head is the Jebel al-Druze, the stomach Homs, and the tail Aleppo. If I crush the head, the serpent will die."" Shishakli dispatched 10,000 regular troops to occupy the Jebel al-Druze. Several towns were bombarded with heavy weapons, killing scores of civilians and destroying many houses. According to Druze accounts, Shishakli encouraged neighboring Bedouin tribes to plunder the defenseless population and allowed his own troops to run amok.
Shishakli launched a brutal campaign to defame the Druze for their religion and politics. He accused the entire community of treason, at times claiming they were in the employ of the British and Hashimites, at others that they were fighting for Israel against the Arabs. He even produced a cache of Israeli weapons allegedly discovered in the Jabal. Even more painful for the Druze community was his publication of ""falsified Druze religious texts"" and false testimonials ascribed to leading Druze sheikhs designed to stir up sectarian hatred. This propaganda also was broadcast in the Arab world, mainly Egypt. Shishakli was assassinated in Brazil on 27 September 1964 by a Druze seeking revenge for Shishakli's bombardment of the Jebel al-Druze.

He forcibly integrated minorities into the national Syrian social structure, his ""Syrianization"" of Alawite and Druze territories had to be accomplished in part using violence. To this end, al-Shishakli encouraged the stigmatization of minorities. He saw minority demands as tantamount to treason. His increasingly chauvinistic notions of Arab nationalism were predicated on the denial that ""minorities"" existed in Syria.
After the Shishakli's military campaign, the Druze community lost much of its political influence, but many Druze military officers played important roles in the Ba'ath government currently ruling Syria.
In 1967, a community of Druze in the Golan Heights came under Israeli control, today numbering 23,000 (in 2019).
Before the Syrian civil war, it was estimated that around 700,000 Druze lived in Syria in 2010, constituting about 3% of the population. Of these, approximately 337,500 resided in the Suwayda Governorate, which had a Druze majority of around 90% and a significant Christian minority. This region accounted for 48.2% of the total Druze population in Syria. Additionally, about 250,000 Druze, or 35.7% of the total Druze population, lived in Damascus and its surrounding areas, including Jaramana, Sahnaya, and Jdeidat Artouz. Approximately 30,000 Druze lived on the eastern side of Mount Hermon, while around 25,000 Druze were spread across 14 villages in Jabal al-Summaq in Idlib Governorate.
The Qalb Loze massacre was a reported massacre of Syrian Druze on 10 June 2015 in the village of Qalb Loze in Syria's northwestern Idlib Governorate in which 20–24 Druze were killed. On 25 July 2018, a group of ISIS-affiliated attackers entered the Druze city of Suwayda and initiated a series of gunfights and suicide bombings on its streets, killing at least 258 people, the vast majority of them civilians.
Several Druze militias fought in the Syrian civil war. These included Jaysh al-Muwahhidin which largely engaged in defensive war, though were also described as supporters of Bashar al-Assad and the Ba'athist government. The Druze Al-Jabal Brigade played a major role in the 2024 Syrian opposition offensives, which toppled the Ba'athists.

In Lebanon
The Druzite community in Lebanon played an important role in the formation of the modern state of Lebanon, and even though they are a minority they play an important role in the Lebanese political scene. Before and during the Lebanese Civil War (1975–90), the Druze were in favor of Pan-Arabism and Palestinian resistance represented by the PLO. Most of the community supported the Progressive Socialist Party formed by their leader Kamal Jumblatt and they fought alongside other leftist and Palestinian parties against the Lebanese Front that was mainly constituted of Christians. At the time, the Lebanese government and economy were running under the significant influence of elites within the Maronite Christian community. After the assassination of Kamal Jumblatt on 16 March 1977, his son Walid Jumblatt took the leadership of the party and played an important role in preserving his father's legacy after winning the Mountain War and sustained the existence of the Druze community during the sectarian bloodshed that lasted until 1990.
In August 2001, Maronite Catholic Patriarch Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir toured the predominantly Druze Chouf region of Mount Lebanon and visited Mukhtara, the ancestral stronghold of Druze leader Walid Jumblatt. The tumultuous reception that Sfeir received not only signified a historic reconciliation between Maronites and Druze, who had fought a bloody war in 1983–1984, but underscored the fact that the banner of Lebanese sovereignty had broad multi-confessional appeal and was a cornerstone for the Cedar Revolution in 2005. Jumblatt's post-2005 position diverged sharply from the tradition of his family. He also accused Damascus of being behind the 1977 assassination of his father, Kamal Jumblatt, expressing for the first time what many knew he privately suspected. The BBC describes Jumblatt as ""the leader of Lebanon's most powerful Druze clan and heir to a leftist political dynasty"". The second largest political party supported by Druze is the Lebanese Democratic Party led by Prince Talal Arslan, the son of Lebanese independence hero Emir Majid Arslan.
The Druze community is primarily located in the rural and mountainous regions to the east and south of Beirut. They represent approximately 5.2 percent of Lebanon's population and are spread across 136 villages in areas such as Hasbaya, Rashaya, Chouf, Aley, Marjeyoun and Beirut. The Druze make up the majority in Aley, Baakleen, Hasbaya and Rashaya. Specifically, they constitute over half of the population in the Aley District, about a third in the Rashaya District, and around a quarter in both the Chouf and Matn Districts.

In Israel
The Druzites form a religious minority in Israel of more than 100,000, mostly residing in the north of the country. In 2004, there were 102,000 Druze living in the country. In 2010, the population of Israeli Druze citizens grew to over 125,000. At the end of 2018, there were 143,000 in Israel and the Israeli-occupied portion of the Golan Heights. Most Israeli Druze identify ethnically as Arabs. Today, thousands of Israeli Druze belong to ""Druze Zionist"" movements.
According to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics census in 2020, the Druze make up about 7.6% of the Arab citizens of Israel. By the end of 2019, around 81% of the Israeli Druze population resided in the Northern District, while 19% were in the Haifa District. The largest Druze communities are found in Daliyat al-Karmel and Yirka (also known as Yarka). The Druze live in 19 towns and villages scattered across the mountaintops in northern Israel, either in exclusively Druze areas or in mixed communities with Christians and Muslims.
The Galilean Druze and Druze of the Haifa region received Israeli citizenship automatically in 1948. After Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 and annexed it to Israel in 1981, the Druze of the Golan Heights were offered full Israeli citizenship under the Golan Heights Law. Most declined Israeli citizenship and retain Syrian citizenship and identity and are treated as permanent residents of Israel. As of 2011, fewer than 10% of the Druze population in the Golan Heights had accepted Israeli citizenship.
In 1957, the Israeli government designated the Druze a distinct religious community at the request of its communal leaders. The Druze are Arabic-speaking citizens of Israel and serve in the Israel Defense Forces, just as most citizens do in Israel. Members of the community have attained top positions in Israeli politics and public service. The number of Druze parliament members usually exceeds their proportion in the Israeli population, and they are integrated within several political parties.
Some scholars maintain that Israel has tried to separate the Druze from other Arab communities, and that the effort has influenced the way Israel's Druze perceive their modern identity. Survey data suggests that Israeli Druze prioritize their identity first as Druze (religiously), second as Arabs (culturally and ethnically), and third as Israelis (citizenship-wise). A small minority of them identify as Palestinians, distinguishing them from the majority of other Arab citizens of Israel, who predominantly identify as Palestinians.

In Jordan
The Druzites form a religious minority in Jordan of around 32,000, mostly residing in the northwestern part of the country. The main areas where they live are Amman, Azraq, Zarqa, Russiefa, Umm Al-Quttein, Aqaba and Mafraq. Druze settlement in Jordan began in 1918, when 22 Druze families left Jabal al-Druze for al-Azraq following the withdrawal of the Turks from the region.

In the diaspora
Venezuela hosts the largest Druze communities outside the Middle East, estimated at 60,000 individuals. Most of them trace their ancestry back to Lebanon and Syria. More than 200,000 people from the Suwayda area hold Venezuelan citizenship, the majority of whom belong to the Syria's Druze sect and immigrated to Venezuela in the past century. Arab immigration to Venezuela started as early as the 19th and 20th centuries, with migrants primarily hailing from the Ottoman provinces of Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine. They settled predominantly in Caracas, and have significantly influenced Venezuelan culture, particularly in terms of Arabic food and music. Religiously, the Arab-Venezuelans community consists mainly of Druze and Christians, who are affiliated with the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Rite Catholic Churches. The early Druze migrants to Venezuela assimilated well into the local population, with some even converting Catholicism. Nevertheless, many retained a strong Druze and Arab identity, along with adherence to Druze values. A prominent example of Druze influence in Venezuela is the former vice president, Tareck El Aissami, who is of Druze descent. Other notable Venezuelan figures of Druze origin include Haifa El Aissami and Tarek William Saab.
The United States is the second largest home of Druze communities outside the Middle East after Venezuela. Estimates vary between about 30,000 and 50,000 Druzes in the United States, with the largest concentration in Southern California. American Druze are mostly of Lebanese and Syrian descent.
Members of the Druze faith face the difficulty of finding a Druze partner and practicing endogamy; marriage outside the Druze faith is strongly discouraged according to the Druze doctrine. They also face the pressure of keeping the religion alive because many Druze immigrants to the United States converted to Protestantism, becoming communicants of the Presbyterian or Methodist churches.

Beliefs
God
The Druze conception of the deity is declared by them to be one of strict and uncompromising unity. The main Druze doctrine states that God is both transcendent and immanent, in which he is above all attributes, but at the same time, he is present.
In their desire to maintain a rigid confession of unity, they stripped from God all attributes (tanzīh). In God, there are no attributes distinct from his essence. He is wise, mighty, and just, not by wisdom, might, and justice, but by his own essence. God is ""the whole of existence"", rather than merely ""above existence"" or on his throne, which would make him ""limited"". There is neither ""how"", ""when"", nor ""where"" about him; in this way, he is incomprehensible.
In this dogma, they are similar to the semi-philosophical, semi-religious body which flourished under Al-Ma'mun and was known by the name of Mu'tazila and the fraternal order of the Brethren of Purity (Ikhwan al-Ṣafa).
Unlike the Mu'tazila, and similar to some branches of Sufism, the Druze believe in the concept of Tajalli (meaning ""theophany""). Tajalli is often misunderstood by scholars and writers and is usually confused with the concept of incarnation.

[Incarnation] is the core spiritual beliefs in the Druze and some other intellectual and spiritual traditions ... In a mystical sense, it refers to the light of God experienced by certain mystics who have reached a high level of purity in their spiritual journey. Thus, God is perceived as the Lahut [the divine] who manifests His Light in the Station (Maqaam) of the Nasut [material realm] without the Nasut becoming Lahut. This is like one's image in the mirror: One is in the mirror, but does not become the mirror. The Druze manuscripts are emphatic and warn against the belief that the Nasut is God ... Neglecting this warning, individual seekers, scholars, and other spectators have considered al-Hakim and other figures divine. ... In the Druze scriptural view, Tajalli takes a central stage. One author comments that Tajalli occurs when the seeker's humanity is annihilated so that divine attributes and light are experienced by the person.

Scriptures
Druze sacred texts include the Quran and the Epistles of Wisdom. Other ancient Druze writings include the Rasa'il al-Hind (Epistles of India) and the previously lost (or hidden) manuscripts such as al-Munfarid bi-Dhatihi and al-Sharia al-Ruhaniyya as well as others including didactic and polemic treatises.

Reincarnation
Reincarnation is a paramount principle in the Druze faith. Reincarnations occur instantly at one's death because there is an eternal duality of the body and the soul and it is impossible for the soul to exist without the body. A human soul will transfer only to a human body, in contrast to the Neoplatonic, Hindu and Buddhist belief systems, according to which souls can transfer to any living creature. Furthermore, a male Druze can be reincarnated only as another male Druze and a female Druze only as another female Druze. A Druze cannot be reincarnated in the body of a non-Druze. Additionally, souls cannot be divided and the number of souls existing in the universe is finite. The cycle of rebirth is continuous and the only way to escape is through successive reincarnations. When this occurs, the soul is united with the Cosmic Mind and achieves the ultimate happiness.

Pact of Time Custodian
The Pact of Time Custodian (Mithāq Walī al-zamān) is considered the entrance to the Druze religion, and they believe that all Druze in their past lives have signed this Charter, and Druze believe that this Charter embodies with human souls after death.

I rely on our Moula Al-Hakim the lonely God, the individual, the eternal, who is out of couples and numbers, (someone) the son of (someone) has approved recognition enjoined on himself and on his soul, in a healthy of his mind and his body, permissibility aversive is obedient and not forced, to repudiate from all creeds, articles and all religions and beliefs on the differences varieties, and he does not know something except obedience of almighty Moulana Al-Hakim, and obedience is worship and that it does not engage in worship anyone ever attended or wait, and that he had handed his soul and his body and his money and all he owns to almighty Maulana Al-Hakim.

The Druze also use a similar formula, called al-'ahd, when one is initiated into the ʻUqqāl.

Sanctuaries
The prayer-houses of the Druze are called khilwa, khalwa, khilwat or khalwat. The primary sanctuary of the Druze is at Khalwat al-Bayada.

Esotericism
The Druze believe that many teachings given by prophets, religious leaders and holy books have esoteric meanings preserved for those of intellect, in which some teachings are symbolic and allegorical in nature, and divide the understanding of holy books and teachings into three layers.
These layers, according to the Druze, are as follows:

The obvious or exoteric (zahir), accessible to anyone who can read or hear;
The hidden or esoteric (batin), accessible to those who are willing to search and learn through the concept of exegesis;
And the hidden of the hidden, a concept known as anagoge, inaccessible to all but a few really enlightened individuals who truly understand the nature of the universe.
Druze do not believe that the esoteric meaning abrogates or necessarily abolishes the exoteric one. Hamza bin Ali refutes such claims by stating that if the esoteric interpretation of taharah (purity) is purity of the heart and soul, it doesn't mean that a person can discard his physical purity, as salat (prayer) is useless if a person is untruthful in his speech and that the esoteric and exoteric meanings complement each other.

Seven Druze precepts
The Druze follow seven moral precepts or duties that are considered the core of the faith.
The Seven Druze precepts are:

Veracity in speech and the truthfulness of the tongue.
Protection and mutual aid to the brethren in faith.
Renunciation of all forms of former worship (specifically, invalid creeds) and false belief.
Repudiation of the devil (Iblis), and all forces of evil (translated from Arabic Toghyan, meaning ""despotism"").
Confession of God's unity.
Acquiescence in God's acts no matter what they be.
Absolute submission and resignation to God's divine will in both secret and public.

Taqiyya
Complicating their identity is the custom of taqiyya—concealing or disguising their beliefs when necessary—that they adopted from Ismailism and the esoteric nature of the faith, in which many teachings are kept secretive. This is done in order to keep the religion from those who are not yet prepared to accept the teachings and therefore could misunderstand it, as well as to protect the community when it is in danger. Some claim to be Muslim or Christian in order to avoid persecution; some do not. Druze in different states can have radically different lifestyles.

Theophany
Hamza ibn Ali ibn Ahmad is considered the founder of the Druze and the primary author of the Druze manuscripts. He proclaimed that God had become human and taken the form of man. Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah is an important figure in the Druze faith whose eponymous founder ad-Darazi proclaimed him as the incarnation of God in 1018. The Druze believe that al-Hākim will return at the end of times to judge the world and establish his kingdom, while Hamza ibn Ali is considered a reincarnation of Jesus, the Universal Mind 'Aql, closely associated with al-Hākim.
The author of the epistle ""The Report of the Jewish and Christians"" (Khabar al-Yahud wal Nasara), part of first volume of the Epistles of Wisdom, appears to have been a Druze individual. The account itself identifies him as Hamza ibn Ali, a supporter of al-Hakim's divinity and the founder of the Druze faith.
Historian David R. W. Bryer defines the Druzes as ghulat of Isma'ilism, since they exaggerated the cult of the caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah and considered him divine; he also defines the Druzes as a religion that deviated from Islam. He also added that as a result of this deviation, the Druze faith ""seems as different from Islam as Islam is from Christianity or Christianity is from Judaism"".

Prophethood
Recognition of prophets in the Druze religion is divided into three sort-of subcategories, the prophet themselves (natiq), their disciples (asas), and witnesses to their message (hujjah).
The number 5 contains an unstated significance within the Druze faith; it is believed in this area that great prophets come in groups of five. In the time of the ancient Greeks, these five were represented by Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Parmenides, and Empedocles. In the first century, the five were represented by Jesus Christ, John the Baptist, Saint Matthew, Saint Mark, and Saint Luke. In the time of the faith's foundation, the five were Hamza ibn Ali ibn Ahmad, Muḥammad ibn Wahb al-Qurashī, Abū'l-Khayr Salama ibn Abd al-Wahhab al-Samurri, Ismāʿīl ibn Muḥammad at-Tamīmī, and Al-Muqtana Baha'uddin.
Druze tradition honors and reveres Hamza ibn Ali Ahmad and Salman the Persian as ""mentors"" and ""prophets"", believed to be reincarnations of the monotheistic idea.

Other beliefs
The Druze allow divorce, although it is discouraged, and circumcision is not necessary. Apostasy is forbidden, and they usually have religious services on Thursday evenings. Druze follow Sunni Hanafi law on issues which their own faith has no particular rulings about.
Formal Druze worship is confined to weekly meeting on Thursday evenings, during which all members of community gather together to discuss local issues before those not initiated into the secrets of the faith (the juhhāl, or the ignorant) are dismissed, and those who are ""uqqāl"" or ""enlightened"" (those few initiated in the Druze holy books) remain to read and study.

Religious symbol
The Druze strictly avoid iconography, but use five colors (""Five Limits"" خمس حدود khams ḥudūd) as a religious symbol: green, red, yellow, blue, and white. The five limits were listed by Ismail at-Tamimi (d. 1030) in the Epistle of the Candle (risalat ash-sham'a) as:

First limit: Hamza Ibn Ali (حمزة إبن علي إبن أحمد) (or Jesus according to other sources)
Second limit: Ismail ibn Muhamed ibn Hamed at-Tamimi (Ismail at-Tamimi) (إسماعيل إبن محمد بن حامد التميمي)
Third limit: Muhamed ibn Wahb (محمد إبن وهب)
Fourth limit (as-Sabiq the anterior): Salama ibn abd al-Wahhab (سلامة إبن عبد الوهاب)
Fifth limit (al-llahiq the posterior): Ali ibn Ahmed as-Samouqi (علي إبن أحمد السموقي)
Each of the colors representing the five limits pertains to a metaphysical power called ḥadd, literally ""a limit"", as in the distinctions that separate humans from animals, or the powers that make humans the animalistic body. Each ḥadd is color-coded in the following manner:

Green for ʻAql ""the Universal Mind/Intelligence/Nous"",
Red for Nafs ""the Universal Soul/Anima mundi"",
Yellow for Kalima ""the Word/Logos"",
Blue for Sābiq (السابق) ""the anterior/potentiality/cause/precedent"", the first intellect.
White for al-llahiq (اللاحق) ""the posterior/future/effect/Immanence"".
The mind generates qualia and gives consciousness. The soul embodies the mind and is responsible for transmigration and the character of oneself. The word, which is the atom of language, communicates qualia between humans and represents the platonic forms in the sensible world. The Sābiq and Tālī is the ability to perceive and learn from the past and plan for the future and predict it.

The colors can be arranged in vertically descending stripes (as a flag), or a five-pointed star. The stripes are a diagrammatic cut of the spheres in neoplatonic philosophy, while the five-pointed star embodies the golden ratio, phi, as a symbol of temperance and a life of moderation.

Prayer houses and holy places
Holy places of the Druze are archaeological sites important to the community and associated with religious holidays; the most notable example being Nabi Shu'ayb, dedicated to Jethro, who is a central figure of the Druze religion. Druze make pilgrimages to this site on the holiday of Ziyarat al-Nabi Shu'ayb.

One of the most important features of the Druze village having a central role in social life is the khilwa or khalwat—a house of prayer, retreat and religious unity. The khalwat may be known as majlis in local languages.
The second type of religious shrine is one associated with the anniversary of a historic event or death of a prophet. If it is a mausoleum the Druze call it mazār and if it is a shrine they call it maqām. The holy places become more important to the community in times of adversity and calamity. The holy places and shrines of the Druze are scattered in various villages, in places where they are protected and cared for. They are found in Syria, Lebanon and Israel.

Initiates and ""ignorant"" members
The Druze do not recognize any religious hierarchy. As such, there is no ""Druze clergy"". Those few initiated in the Druze holy books are called عقال ʻuqqāl (""the wise""), while the regular members of the group are called جهال juhhāl (""the ignorant""). Some find this classification disparaging however, and as such, terms like روحاني rūḥāniyy, meaning ""(concerned with the) spiritual"", and جسماني jismāniyy, meaning ""(concerned with the) physical"", are also used.

Given the strict religious, intellectual and spiritual requirements, most of the Druze are not initiated and might be referred to as al-Juhhāl (جهال), literally ""the Ignorant"", but in practice referring to the non-initiated Druze. However, that term is seldom used by the Druze. Those Druze are not granted access to the Druze holy literature or allowed to attend the initiated religious meetings of the ʻuqqāl. The ""juhhāl"" are the vast majority of the Druze community. The cohesiveness and frequent inter-community social interaction, however, enables most Druze to have an idea about their broad ethical requirements and have some sense of what their theology consists of (albeit often flawed).

The initiated religious group, which includes both men and women (less than 10% of the population), is called al-ʻUqqāl (عقال ""the Knowledgeable Initiates""). They might or might not dress differently, although most wear a costume that was characteristic of mountain people in previous centuries. Women can opt to wear al-mandīl, a loose white veil, especially in the presence of other people. They wear al-mandīl on their heads to cover their hair and wrap it around their mouths. They wear black shirts and long skirts covering their legs to their ankles. Male ʻuqqāl often grow mustaches, and wear dark Levantine-Turkish traditional dresses, called the shirwal, with white turbans that vary according to the seniority of the ʻuqqāl. Traditionally the Druze women have played an important role both socially and religiously inside the community.
Al-ʻuqqāl have equal rights to al-Juhhāl, but establish a hierarchy of respect based on religious service. The most influential of al-ʻuqqāl become Ajawīd, recognized religious leaders, and from this group the spiritual leaders of the Druze are assigned. While the Shaykh al-ʻAql, which is an official position in Syria, Lebanon, and Israel, is elected by the local community and serves as the head of the Druze religious council, judges from the Druze religious courts are usually elected for this position. Unlike the spiritual leaders, the authority of the Shaykh al-ʻAql is limited to the country he is elected in, though in some instances spiritual leaders are elected to this position.
The Druze believe in the unity of God, and are often known as the ""People of Monotheism"" or simply ""Monotheists"". Their theology has a Neo-Platonic view about how God interacts with the world through emanations and is similar to some gnostic and other esoteric sects. Druze philosophy also shows Sufi influences.
Druze principles focus on honesty, loyalty, filial piety, altruism, patriotic sacrifice, and monotheism. They reject nicotine, alcohol, and other drugs and often, the consumption of pork (to the Uqqāl and not necessarily to the Juhhāl). Druze reject polygamy, believe in reincarnation, and are not obliged to observe most of the religious rituals. The Druze believe that rituals are symbolic and have an individualistic effect on the person, for which reason Druze are free to perform them, or not. The community does celebrate Eid al-Adha, however, considered their most significant holiday; though their form of observance is different compared to that of most Muslims.

Culture
The Druze community maintains Arabic language and culture as core elements of their identity. Arabic is their primary language, and Druze cultural practices and traditions are deeply intertwined with the broader Arab heritage. While the Druze have their unique religious beliefs and customs, they actively preserve and contribute to Arabic cultural and social life in the Levant. They have had a significant impact on the region's history and culture and continue to play a notable political role.
Traditionally, most Druze are not initiated into the deeper secrets of the faith and are considered ""juhhāl"", or ""the ignorant"". Only a minority, known as the ""uqqāl"" or ""enlightened,"" are initiated into the Druze holy books and engage in religious study. The religious life of the average Druze (""juhhāl"") revolves around a very small number of events—birth and circumcision, engagement and marriage, death and burial—and is devoid of special Druze prayers or worship. Marriage outside the Druze faith is forbidden, and if a Druze marries a non-Druze, the Druze may be ostracized and marginalized by their community. Because a non-Druze partner cannot convert to Druze faith, the couple cannot have Druze children, because the Druze faith can only be passed on through birth to two Druze parents.
Circumcision is widely practiced by the Druze. The procedure is practiced as a cultural tradition, and has no religious significance in the Druze faith. There is no special date for this act in the Druze faith: male Druze infants are usually circumcised shortly after birth, however some remain uncircumcised until the age of ten or older. Some Druze do not circumcise their male children, and refuse to observe this ""common Muslim practice"".
Druze communities are often close-knit and maintain a strong sense of identity and solidarity. A key aspect of their religious practice includes ziyarat, or visits to holy places. One of the most significant events in Druze religious life is the annual pilgrimage to the Shrine of Shu'ayb, observed between April 25 and 28. This pilgrimage is dedicated to Shu'ayb, whom Druze believe to be a prophet and whose purported tomb is located at this shrine. This event is so important that it is officially recognized as a public holiday in Israel.

Language
The mother tongue of Druze in Syria, Lebanon and Israel is Levantine Arabic, except those born and living in the Druze diaspora such as Venezuela, where Arabic was not taught or spoken at home. The Druze Arabic dialect, especially in the rural areas, is often different from the other regional Arabic dialects. Druze Arabic dialect is distinguished from others by retention of the phoneme /q/, the use of which by Druze is particularly prominent in the mountains and less so in urban areas.
The Druze citizens of Israel are Arabic in language and culture, and linguistically speaking, the majority of them are fluently bilingual, speaking both a Central Northern Levantine Arabic dialect and Hebrew. In Druze Arab homes and towns in Israel, the primary language spoken is Arabic, while some Hebrew words have entered the colloquial Arabic dialect. They often use Hebrew characters to write their Arabic dialect online.

Cultural identity
Various scholars agree that the Druze community's cultural identity is deeply intertwined with their Arab heritage. Historian Nejla Abu-Izzedin and Kamal Salibi both argue that the Druze are profoundly embedded within the Arab cultural framework, as demonstrated by their common language and social customs. They assert that this integration is apparent through the Druze's active participation in regional traditions and their assimilation into Arab society, despite their distinct religious and philosophical beliefs.
Scholar Robert Brenton Betts explains that the Druze social structure is characterized by a strong sense of community and the leadership of religious elders known as 'sheikhs'. These leaders are pivotal in guiding both the spiritual and social aspects of Druze life, which is crucial for preserving their unique identity. Betts also points to specific Druze practices, such as the annual pilgrimage to the Shrine of Shu'ayb, as examples of how these traditions, along with the role of the sheikhs, are deeply ingrained in Druze social life. He argues that these practices are not just religious rituals but are fundamental to reinforcing Druze unity and continuity.
According to some scholars, the Druze cultural identity is shaped by their interactions with both Christian and Muslim communities, reflecting a synthesis of religious and cultural influences. Historians notes that the Druze have historically maintained a positive relationship with Christians, as evidenced by shared traditions and social practices in Mount Lebanon. This interaction has led to overlapping symbols, customs, mutual veneration of saints and their shrines, and shared terminology for God. Sites such as the Church of Saidet et Tallé in Deir el Qamar, historically a popular Marian pilgrimage site among the Druze, exemplify this cultural exchange. The Druze also venerate Christian saints like Saint George and the Prophet Elijah, admired for their ""bravery and warrior-like qualities"". Scholar Pierre-Yves Beaurepaire observes that these warrior saints resonate with the Druze due to their parallels with Druze militarized traditions. The baptism of children, in line with Christian tradition, was common among prominent Lebanese Druze families. Historian Aharon Layish notes that there is clear evidence of Druzes in Lebanon during the Ottoman period who posed as Christians for practical reasons.
Conversely, despite sharing historical roots with Muslims, the Druze often experience a more complex relationship with Muslim communities due to their distinct religious beliefs and practices. Historically, the Druze faced significant persecution from Muslim regimes, which led them to keep their religious beliefs secret. According to Druze narrative, these acts of persecution were aimed at eradicating the entire community. This narrative has shaped the Druze sense of identity and their awareness of survival. As a survival strategy, some Druze have historically posed as Muslims, a practice known as taqiya. This concealment has led to a synthesis of Druze religious practice and cultural identity with Islamic elements, as noted by scholars.

Cuisine
Druze cuisine is Arab cuisine, and shares many similarities with other Levantine cuisines. It features a rich array of grains, meat, potato, cheese, bread, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, fresh fish and tomatoes. A hallmark of Druze and Levantine cuisine is meze including tabbouleh, hummus and baba ghanoush. Kibbeh nayyeh is also a popular mezze among the Druze. Other well-known dishes among Druzes include falafel, sfiha, shawarma, dolma, kibbeh, kusa mahshi, shishbarak, muhammara, and mujaddara. Among the popular traditional Arabic dessert by the Druze is Knafeh. In Israel, the Saj bread is known as ""Druze Pita"" as it was easier for Israeli Jews to identify with Druze than with Arabs. It is a pita filled with labneh (thick yoghurt) and topped with olive oil and za’atar, and a very popular bread in Israel. Al-Meleh a popular dish among Druze in Hauran region (Suwayda Governorate), cooked in a pressure cooker and served on huge special plates at weddings, holidays, and other special occasions. And consists of bulgur wheat immersed in ghee with lamb and yogurt, and served hot with fried kibbeh and vegetables.
For reasons that remain unclear, the Mulukhiyah dish was banned by the Fatimid Caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah sometime during his reign (996–1021). While the ban was eventually lifted after the end of his reign, the Druze, who hold Al-Hakim in high regard and give him quasi-divine authority, continue to respect the ban, and do not eat Mulukhiyah of any kind to this day.
Mate (in Levantine Arabic, متة /mæte/) is a popular drink consumed by the Druze brought to the Levant by Syrian migrants from Argentina in the 19th century. Mate is made by steeping dried leaves of the South American yerba mate plant in hot water and is served with a metal straw (بمبيجة bambīja or مصاصة maṣṣāṣah) from a gourd (فنجان finjān or قَرْعَة qarʻah). Mate is often the first item served when entering a Druze home. It is a social drink and can be shared between multiple participants. After each drinker, the metal straw is cleaned with lemon rind. Traditional snacks eaten with mate include raisins, nuts, dried figs, biscuits, and chips.

Marriage
The Druze rejection of polygamy, unlike in traditional Islamic traditions, reflects a significant influence from Christianity on their faith. While the Druze cite certain Quranic verses to justify their position, it more closely mirrors the Christian perspective on marriage. Additionally, the practice of monasticism by some Druze sheikhs is highly regarded within their community. It's not uncommon for a sheikh to request celibacy from his fiancée, and many Druze sheikhs remain unmarried throughout their lives. In Druze belief, sex is seen not as an end in itself but as a means of reproduction, with certain sexual forms considered sinful.
The Druze doctrine does not permit outsiders to convert to their religion, as only one who is born to Druze parents can be considered a Druze. Marriage outside the Druze faith is uncommon and strongly discouraged for both males and females. If a Druze individual, whether male or female, marries a non-Druze, they may face ostracism and marginalization from their community. Since a non-Druze partner cannot convert to the Druze faith, the couple cannot have Druze children, as the Druze faith can only be inherited from two Druze parents at birth. Marrying a non-Druze, whether male or female, is viewed as apostasy from the Druze religion. The Druze community holds a negative perception of apostates who marry outside the religion. Consequently, those who leave the Druze religion due to interfaith marriage are forced to leave their village and are exiled to distant, non-Druze areas. This religious and social pressure leads to their isolation and classification as outcasts within their Druze community.

Druze and other religions
Relationship with Muslims
The Druze faith is often classified as a branch of Isma'ilism; although according to various scholars Druze faith ""diverge substantially from Islam, both Sunni and Shia"". Even though the faith originally developed out of Ismaili Islam, most Druze do not identify as Muslims, and they do not accept the five pillars of Islam. Historian David R. W. Bryer defines the Druzes as ghulat of Isma'ilism, since they exaggerated the cult of the caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah and considered him divine; he also defines the Druzes as a religion that deviated from Islam. He also added that as a result of this deviation, the Druze faith ""seems as different from Islam as Islam is from Christianity or Christianity is from Judaism"".
Historically the relationship between the Druze and Muslims has been characterized by intense persecution. The Druze have frequently experienced persecution by different Muslim regimes such as the Shia Fatimid Caliphate, Mamluk, Sunni Ottoman Empire, and Egypt Eyalet. The persecution of the Druze included massacres, demolishing Druze prayer houses and holy places, and forced conversion to Islam. Those acts of persecution were meant to eradicate the whole community according to the Druze narrative. Most recently, the Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, saw persecution of the Druze at the hands of Islamic extremists.
Since Druze emerged from Islam and share certain beliefs with Islam, its position of whether it is a separate religion or a sect of Islam is sometimes controversial among Muslim scholars. Druze are not considered Muslims by those belonging to orthodox Islamic schools of thought. Ibn Taymiyya, a prominent Muslim scholar muhaddith, dismissed the Druze as non-Muslims, and his fatwa cited that Druze: ""Are not at the level of ′Ahl al-Kitāb (People of the Book) nor mushrikin (polytheists). Rather, they are from the most deviant kuffār (Infidel) ... Their women can be taken as slaves and their property can be seized ... they are to be killed whenever they are found and cursed as they described ... It is obligatory to kill their scholars and religious figures so that they do not misguide others"", which in that setting would have legitimized violence against them as apostates. The Ottoman Empire often relied on Ibn Taymiyya's religious ruling to justify their persecution of Druze. In contrast, according to Ibn Abidin, whose work Radd al-Muhtar 'ala al-Durr al-Mukhtar is still considered the authoritative text of Hanafi fiqh today, the Druze are neither Muslims nor apostates.
In 1959, in an ecumenical move driven by Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser's effort to broaden his political appeal after the establishment of the United Arab Republic between Egypt and Syria in 1958, the Islamic scholar Mahmud Shaltut at Al Azhar University in Cairo classified the Druze as Muslims, even though most Druze no longer consider themselves Muslim. The fatwa declares that the Druze are Muslims because they recite the twofold Shahada, and believe in the Qur'an and monotheism and do not oppose Islam in word or deed. This fatwa was not accepted by all in the Islamic world, many dissenting scholars have argued the Druze recite the Shahada as a form of taqiya; a precautionary dissimulation or denial of religious belief and practice in the face of persecution. Some sects of Islam, including all Shia denominations, don't recognize the religious authority of Al Azhar University, those that do sometimes challenge the religious legitimacy of Shaltut's fatwa because it was issued for political reasons, as Gamal Abdel Nasser saw it as a tool to spread his appeal and influence across the entire Arab world.
In 2012, due to a drift towards Salafism in Al-Azhar, and the ascension of the Muslim Brotherhood into Egyptian political leadership, the dean of the Faculty of Islamic Studies at Al-Azhar issued a fatwa strongly opposed to the 1959 fatwa. 

Both religions venerate Shuaib and Muhammad: Shuaib (Jethro) is revered as the chief prophet in the Druze religion, and in Islam he is considered a prophet of God. Muslims regard Muhammad as the final and paramount prophet sent by God, to the Druze, Muhammad is exalted as one of the seven prophets sent by God in different periods of history.
In terms of religious comparison, Islamic schools and branches do not believe in reincarnation, a paramount tenet of the Druze faith. Islam teaches dawah, whereas the Druze do not accept converts to their faith. Marriage outside the Druze faith is rare and is strongly discouraged. Islamic schools and branches allow for divorce and permit men to be married to multiple women, contrary to the views of the Druze in monogamous marriage and not allowing divorce. Differences between Islamic schools and branches and Druze include their belief in the theophany, Hamza ibn Ali ibn Ahmad is considered the founder of the Druze and the primary author of the Druze manuscripts; he proclaimed that God had become human and taken the form of man, Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. Within Islam, however, such a concept of theophany is a denial of monotheism.
The Druze faith incorporates some elements of Islam, and other religious beliefs. Druze Sacred texts include the Qur'an and the Epistles of Wisdom (rasail al-hikma رسائل الحكمة) The Druze community does celebrate Eid al-Adha as their most significant holiday; though their form of observance is different compared to that of most Muslims. The Druze faith does not follow Sharia nor any of the Five Pillars of Islam save reciting the Shahada. Scholars argue that Druze recite the Shahada in order to protect their religion and their own safety, and to avoid persecution by Muslims.

Relationship with Christians
Christianity and Druze are Abrahamic religions that share a historical traditional connection with some major theological differences. The two faiths share a common place of origin in the Middle East and are both monotheistic.
The relationship between Druze and Christians has been characterized largely by harmony and peaceful coexistence. Amicable relations between the two groups prevailed throughout most of history, though a few exceptions exist, including the 1860 civil conflict in Mount Lebanon and Damascus. Conversion of Druze to Christianity used to be common practice in the Levant region. Over the centuries, several prominent members of the Druze community have embraced Christianity, including some of Shihab dynasty members, as well as the Abi-Lamma clan.
Christian and Druze communities share a long history of interaction dating back roughly a millennium, particularly in Mount Lebanon. Interaction between Christian communities (members of the Maronites, Eastern Orthodox, Melkite, and other churches) and the Unitarian Druze led to the presence of mixed villages and towns in Mount Lebanon, Chouf, Wadi al-Taym, Jabal al-Druze, the Galilee region, Mount Carmel, and Golan Heights. The Maronite Catholic and the Druze founded modern Lebanon in the early Eighteenth Century, through a governing and social system known as the ""Maronite-Druze dualism"" in the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate.

Druze doctrine teaches that Christianity is to be ""esteemed and praised"" as the Gospel writers are regarded as ""carriers of wisdom"". The Druze faith incorporates some elements of Christianity, in addition to adoption of Christian elements on the Epistles of Wisdom. The full Druze canon or Druze scripture (Epistles of Wisdom) includes the Old Testament, the New Testament, the Quran and philosophical works by Plato and those influenced by Socrates among works from other religions and philosophers. The Druze faith shows influence of Christian monasticism, among other religious practices. Some scholars suggest that early Christian Gnostic beliefs might have influenced Druze theology, particularly in concepts of divine knowledge and reincarnation. These influences and incorporations of Christian elements encompass the adoption of the concept of Christianizing al-Mahdi's persona among the Druze, as well as the integration of verses from the Bible concerning the Messiah by certain Druze founders.
In terms of religious comparison, mainstream Christian denominations do not believe in reincarnation or the transmigration of the soul, unlike the Druze. Evangelism is widely seen as central to the Christian faith, unlike the Druze who do not accept converts. Marriage outside the Druze faith is rare and is strongly discouraged. Similarities between the Druze and Christians include commonalities in their view of monogamous marriage, as well as the forbidding of divorce and remarriage, in addition to the belief in the oneness of God and theophany.
Neither mainstream Christian denominations nor Druze require male circumcision, though male circumcision is commonly practiced in many predominantly Christian countries and many Christian communities, and it is practiced in Coptic Christianity, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, and the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church as a rite of passage. Male circumcision is also widely practiced by the Druze, but as a cultural tradition, since circumcision has no religious significance in the Druze faith. 

Both faiths give a prominent place to Jesus: In Christianity, Jesus is the central figure, seen as the messiah. To the Druze, Jesus is an important prophet of God, being among the seven prophets (including Muhammad) who appeared in different periods of history. The Druze revere Jesus ""the son of Joseph and Mary"" and his four disciples, who wrote the Gospels. According to the Druze manuscripts Jesus is the Greatest Imam and the incarnation of Ultimate Reason (Akl) on earth and the first cosmic principle (Hadd), and regards Jesus and Hamza ibn Ali as the incarnations of one of the five great celestial powers, who form part of their system. In the Druze tradition, Jesus is known under three titles: the True Messiah (al-Masih al-Haq), the Messiah of all Nations (Masih al-Umam), and the Messiah of Sinners. This is due, respectively, to the belief that Jesus delivered the true Gospel message, the belief that he was the Saviour of all nations, and the belief that he offers forgiveness.
Both religions venerate the Virgin Mary, John the Baptist, Saint George, Elijah, Luke the Evangelist, Job and other common figures. Figures in the Old Testament such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jethro are considered important prophets of God in the Druze faith, being among the seven prophets who appeared in different periods of history.

Relationship with Jews
The relationship between the Druze and Jews has been controversial, Antisemitic material is contained in the Druze literature such as the Epistles of Wisdom; for example in an epistle ascribed to one of the founders of Druze, Baha al-Din al-Muqtana, probably written sometime between AD 1027 and AD 1042, accused the Jews of crucifying Jesus. In other epistles, Jews are depicted negatively as ""morally corrupt and murderers of prophets"", particularly in chapters 13–14 of the Epistles of Wisdom. The epistle ""Excuses and Warnings"" predicts that, as a sign of the end times, Jews will seize control of Jerusalem and seek revenge on its inhabitants as well as those of Acre. Afterwards, Messiah Jesus will expel the Jews from Jerusalem due to their spread of moral corruption worldwide. Christians will then dominate Muslims until the Day of Judgment, when divine judgment by Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah will occur.
On the other hand, Benjamin of Tudela, a Jewish traveler from the 12th century, pointed out that the Druze maintained good commercial relations with the Jews nearby, and according to him this was because the Druze liked the Jewish people. Yet, the Jews and Druze lived isolated from each other, except in a few mixed towns such as Deir al-Qamar and Peki'in. The Deir el Qamar Synagogue was built in 1638, during the Ottoman era in Lebanon, to serve the local Jewish population, some of whom were part of the immediate entourage of the Druze Emir Fakhr-al-Din II.
During the Ottoman period, relations between the Druze of Galilee and the Jewish community were generally strained and marked by conflict. In 1660, during a Druze power struggle in Mount Lebanon, Druze forces destroyed Jewish settlements in the Galilee, including Safad and Tiberias. The tension escalated in 1834 during the Peasants' Revolt, when Safed's Jewish community endured a month-long assault that involved extensive looting, violence, and the destruction of Jewish properties by both Druze and Muslims. During the Druze revolt against the rule of Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt, the Jewish community in Safad was attacked by Druze rebels in early July 1838, the violence against the Jews included plundering their homes and desecrating their synagogues.

Interactions between Jews and Druze were rare before the establishment of Israel in 1948, as they historically lived isolated from each other. During the British Mandate for Palestine, the Druze did not embrace the rising Arab nationalism of the time or participate in violent confrontations with Jewish immigrants. In 1948, many Druze volunteered for the Israeli army and no Druze villages were destroyed or permanently abandoned. Since the establishment of the state of Israel, the Druze have demonstrated solidarity with Israel and distanced themselves from Arab Islamic radicalism. Israeli Druze male citizens serve in the Israel Defense Forces. The Jewish-Druze partnership was often referred as ""a covenant of blood"" (Hebrew: ברית דמים, brit damim) in recognition of the common military yoke carried by the two peoples for the security of the country. Israeli Druze scholars Kais M. Firro and Rabah Halabi contend that the Israeli narrative of a ""special historical bond"" or ""blood pact"" between Druze and Jews is a myth fabricated by early Zionist circles to divide and control Arab religious communities in Israel, with no historical foundation. Conversely, the Druze community in Syria, Lebanon, and the Golan Heights generally aligns with Arab nationalism and holds predominantly anti-Zionist views.
From 1957, the Israeli government formally recognized the Druze as a separate religious community, and they are defined as a distinct ethnic group in the Israeli Ministry of Interior's census registration. Israeli Druze do not consider themselves Muslim, and see their faith as a separate and independent religion. While compared to other Israeli Christians and Muslims, Druze place less emphasis on their Arab identity and self-identify more as Israeli. However, they were less ready for personal relationships with Jews compared to Israeli Muslims and Christians. Scholars attribute this trend to cultural differences between Jews and Druze.
In terms of religious comparison, scholars consider Judaism and the Druze faith as ethnoreligious groups, both practicing endogamy, and both typically do not proselytize. Belief in reincarnation (Gilgul) exist in some strands of Judaism influenced by the Kabbalah, such as Hasidic Judaism, but is rejected by mainstream Jewish denominations (Reform Judaism, Conservative Judaism and Orthodox Judaism). Figures in the Hebrew Bible such as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses are considered important prophets of God in the Druze faith, being among the seven prophets who appeared in different periods of history. Both religions venerate Elijah, Job and other common figures. In the Hebrew Bible, Jethro was Moses' father-in-law, a Kenite shepherd and priest of Midian. Jethro of Midian is considered an ancestor of the Druze who revere him as their spiritual founder and chief prophet.

Origins
Ethnic origins
A study carried out by th Israeli Druze historian Kais M. Firro examines various theories about the origins of the Druze, including possible connections to the Arameans, Arabs, Itureans, Cuthites, Hivites, Armenians, Persians, and Turks. Some suggested a European origin. In the 17th century, there was a prevailing belief in France that the Druze were descendants of a lost army of European Christian crusaders. According to this notion, after the fall of the Christian stronghold of Acre in 1291 and the subsequent persecution by the victorious Mamluks, these crusaders sought refuge in the mountains of Lebanon and settled there permanently.
According to Firro, two main approaches have been used to trace Druze origins. The first examines religious texts and the ethnic backgrounds of the early Druze leaders. The second focuses on the migration and settlement patterns of ancient peoples and tribes in the Druze regions before the 11th century. The third approach relies on anthropometric studies.
The main proponent of the first approach is historian Philip Hitti, whose theory is a key reference for tracing Druze origins. Hitti proposed that the Druze are a blend of Persians, Iraqis, and Persianized Arabs who adopted new beliefs. He supported this with three arguments: first, the early founders and disseminators of the Druze religion were of Persians origin; second, some of the Druze religious lexicon is Persian; and third, the native inhabitants of Wadi al-Taym where Druze faith beliefs first spread, were influenced by Persian and Iraqi or Persianized Arab cultures before 1077. However, Martin Sprengling criticized Hitti's theory, arguing that not all early Druze leaders were of Persian origin—citing Baha al-Din al-Muqtana as an example of Arab origin. Sprengling also noted that Wadi al-Taym's inhabitants before 1077 were mostly pure Arab tribes such as the Tanukhids and Taym Allah tribe. He concluded that the Druze are mainly a combination of various ethnic groups, with a major influence from Arabs, particularly southern Arabs, along with an indigenous mountain population of Aramaic origin. Additionally, Two English researchers, Gertrude Bell and David Hogarth, also proposed that the Druze are a blend of Arabs from Southern Arabia and the mountain-dwelling Aramaeans.

The second approach, used by Druze historians, scholars, intellectuals and clerics, emphasizes the migration and settlement of Arab tribes to highlight the pure Arab lineage of those who adopted Druze beliefs in the 11th century. Proponents argue that the Druze speak a ""pure Arab dialect"" and are of ""pure Arab blood"", not mixed with Turkish or other influences, due to their practice of strict endogamy marriage. This view maintains that most Druze are descended from 12 Arab tribes that migrated to Syria before the Islamic period. It relies on historical records, Druze chronicles, and genealogical trees reconstructed by Druze families to trace their ancestry and settlement in Syria. According to Firro, all Druze historians, scholars and leaders in Lebanon and Syria consider the Druze to be Arabs, and this view is accepted by the entire Druze community in those countries. In contrast, while most Druze in Israel consider themselves Arabs, some Israeli Druze politicians have begun to reject the idea of Arabic racial origin as a component of Druze national identity for political reasons.
According to Firro, the third approach in the research on Druze origins is based on the conclusions of researchers and anthropologists. Studies by Felix von Luschan, Arries and Kappers found that Druze in the Levant, along with their Muslim and Christian counterparts, share the same origins. Similarly, Druze historian Nejla Abu-Izzedin has concluded that Druze, Christians, and Muslims in the Levant have the same racial background.
According to Druze historian Amin Talea', Druze oral and written traditions recount that twelve Arab tribes converted to Islam and fought alongside Muslim warriors until they were introduced to the Druze religion by preachers sent from Egypt by the Fatimid caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. Talea' adds that, over time, the Druze developed a strong sense of their pure Arab origins, believing that, apart from their unique religious practices, their spiritual and material culture closely mirrored that of the broader population of Greater Syria.

Arabian hypothesis
The Druze faith extended to many areas in the Middle East, but most of the modern Druze can trace their origin to the Wadi al-Taym in Southern Lebanon, which is named after an Arab tribe Taym Allah (or Taym Allat) which, according to Islamic historian al-Tabari, first came from the Arabian Peninsula into the valley of the Euphrates where they had been Christianized prior to their migration into Lebanon. Many of the Druze feudal families, whose genealogies have been preserved by the two modern Syrian chroniclers Haydar al-Shihabi and Ahmad Faris al-Shidyaq, seem also to point in the direction of this origin. Arabian tribes emigrated via the Persian Gulf and stopped in Iraq on their route that would later to lead them to Syria. The first feudal Druze family, the Tanukhids, which made for itself a name in fighting the Crusaders was, according to Haydar al-Shihabi, an Arab tribe from Mesopotamia where it occupied the position of a ruling family and apparently was Christianized.
Travelers like Niebuhr, and scholars like Max von Oppenheim, undoubtedly echoing the popular Druze belief regarding their own origin, have classified them as Arabs.
The Arabian hypothesis is widely regarded as the leading explanation for the origins of the Druze people among historians, scholars, intellectuals, and religious leaders within the Druze community. This theory suggests that the Druze descended from twelve Arab tribes that migrated to Syria before and during the early Islamic period. It also serves as the primary framework for understanding their historical and racial origins, as reflected in their oral traditions and written literature. This hypothesis is central to the Druze's self-perception and cultural identity. This view is accepted by the entire Druze community in Syria and Lebanon, as well as by most Druze in Israel. The Arabic language is spoken by the Druze and is also the language in which their sacred texts are written. Scholars who hold this view argue that this linguistic connection underscores the Druze's ethnic Arab identity.
According to Druze historian Nejla Abu-Izzedin, the Druze people are of Arab origin, both culturally and historically. She explains that Druze traditions and narratives consistently trace their roots to Arab tribes who settled in Syria, some prior to the advent of Islam and others during the Muslim conquest. Abu-Izzedin further notes that when the Druze community was established, its members were spread across a wide area of Syria. The majority of those who embraced the Druze faith were Arab tribes from the northern region, making the Arab elements of the community predominant. According to Abu-Izzedin, ""ethnically"", the ""Wadi al-Taym has been authoritatively stated to be one of the most Arab regions of [geographical] Syria"". The area was one of the two most important centers of Druze missionary activity in the 11th century.
Additionally, Abu-Izzedin highlights that the Tanukhids, an Arab tribe, hold a significant place in Druze history. She asserts that the Druze claims of Arab origin were not driven by self-interest, as Arabs were no longer in a dominant position when the Druze community was founded in the 11th century. Furthermore, Druze narratives recount their involvement in pivotal events in Arab history. In modern times, the Druze have largely adopted Arab nationalism and played a notable role in the Great Syrian Revolt of 1920's.
Druze scholar Sami Makarem notes that Wadi Taym and southern Lebanon (Jabal Amel) were pivotal centers for Druze missionary activity in the 11th century, inhabited by Arab tribes. He explains that Druze oral traditions and religious documents suggest that most Druze ancestors came from twelve Arab tribes in Maarat al-Numan during the early period of Islam and its conquests. Later, they migrated and settled in Lebanon. Makarem highlights the Druze's strong Arab heritage, noting that early Druze followers were predominantly of Arab descent. He also points out that many tribes settling in the Levant before Islam came from southern Arabia, including Yamani and Qaysi tribes. According to Makarem, Druze belief links their ancestry to tribes that lived in [geographical] Syria, some before Islam and others arriving during the conquest.
Israeli Druze historian Salman Hamud Fallah asserted that the Druze people of today originated from the Arabian Peninsula. He noted that some of their ancestors came from the northern part of the peninsula, while others came from the southern region, specifically Yemen. In addition, Israeli Druze historian Yusri Hazran describes the Druze narrative, which holds that twelve Arab tribes migrated into the Syrian region either before the rise of Islam or during the early Islamic period. These tribes were predominantly of Yamani tribes, with the Tanukhids being the most dominant among them. Subsequently, these tribes adopted the Druze doctrine. Hazran affirms that this narrative is recognized within Druze doctrine and its scriptures.
Druze researchers and historians from Israel, such as Kais M. Firro, Rabah Halabi, Munir Fakhr El-Din, and Afifa E. Kheir, confirm that the Druze are Arabs and note that this was not a contentious issue in Israel before 1962. Halabi observes that Israeli policies aimed at granting the Druze a distinct community status and political identity led some Druze to see this separate ""Druze-Israeli identity"" as an ethnic marker for social integration within Israeli society. Firro argues that efforts to create a separate Druze identity distinct from Arabs are politically motivated and lack historical basis, citing Druze religious and historical literature that affirms their Arab heritage. Scholar Michael Cohen adds that, despite the Israeli and Zionist narrative promoting a distinct ""Druze ethnic identity"", most Druze in Israel view their origins as Arab and consider their Druze identity primarily as religious.

Druze as a mixture of Western Asian tribes
The 1911 edition of Encyclopædia Britannica states that the Druze are ""a mixture of refugee stocks, in which the Arab largely predominates, grafted on to an original mountain population of Aramaic blood"".

Iturean hypothesis
According to Jewish contemporary literature, the Druze, who were visited and described in 1165 by Benjamin of Tudela, were pictured as descendants of the Itureans, an Ismaelite Arab tribe, which used to reside in the northern parts of the Golan plateau through Hellenistic and Roman periods. The word Druzes, in an early Hebrew edition of his travels, occurs as Dogziyin, but it is clear that this is a scribal error.
Archaeological assessments of the Druze region have also proposed the possibility of Druze descending from Itureans, who had inhabited Mount Lebanon and Golan Heights in late classic antiquity, but their traces fade in the Middle Ages.

Genetics
Lebanese Christians and Druze became a genetic isolate in the predominantly Islamic world.
In a 2005 study of ASPM gene variants, Mekel-Bobrov et al. found that the Israeli Druze people of the Mount Carmel region have among the highest rate of the newly evolved ASPM- Haplogroup D, at 52.2% occurrence of the approximately 6,000-year-old allele. While it is not yet known exactly what selective advantage is provided by this gene variant, the Haplogroup D allele is thought to be positively selected in populations and to confer some substantial advantage that has caused its frequency to rapidly increase.
A 2004 DNA study has shown that Israeli Druze are remarkable for the high frequency (35%) of males who carry the Y-chromosomal haplogroup L, which is otherwise uncommon in the Middle East (Shen et al. 2004). This haplogroup originates from prehistoric South Asia and has spread from Pakistan into southern Iran. A 2008 study done on larger samples showed that L-M20 averages 27% in Mount Carmel Druze, 2% in Galilee Druze, 8% in Lebanese Druze, and it was not found in a sample of 59 Syrian Druze (Slush et al. 2008).
Cruciani, in 2007, found E1b1b1a2 (E-V13) [a subclade of E1b1b1a (E-M78)] in high levels (>10% of the male population) in Cypriot and Druze lineages. Recent genetic clustering analyses of ethnic groups are consistent with the close ancestral relationship between the Druze and Cypriots, and also identified similarity to the general Syrian and Lebanese populations, as well as the major Jewish divisions (Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Iraqi, and Moroccan Jews) (Behar et al. 2010).
Also, a new study concluded that the Druze harbor a remarkable diversity of mitochondrial DNA lineages that appear to have separated from each other thousands of years ago. But instead of dispersing throughout the world after their separation, the full range of lineages can still be found within the Druze population.
The researchers noted that the Druze villages contained a striking range of high frequency and high diversity of the X haplogroup, suggesting that this population provides a glimpse into the past genetic landscape of the Near East at a time when the X haplogroup was more prevalent.
These findings are consistent with the Druze oral tradition that claims that the adherents of the faith came from diverse ancestral lineages stretching back tens of thousands of years. The Shroud of Turin analysis shows significant traces of mitochondrial DNA unique to the Druze community.
A 2008 study published on the genetic background of Druze communities in Israel showed highly heterogeneous parental origins. A total of 311 Israeli Druze were sampled: 37 from the Golan Heights, 183 from the Galilee, and 35 from Mount Carmel, as well as 27 Druze immigrants from Syria and 29 from Lebanon (Slush et al. 2008). The researchers found the following frequencies of Y-chromosomal and MtDNA haplogroups:

Mount Carmel: L 27%, R 27%, J 18%, E 15%, G 12%.
Galilee: J 31%, R 20%, E 18%, G 14%, K 11%, Q 4%, L 2%.
Golan Heights: J 54%, E 29%, I 8%, G 4%, C 4%.
Lebanon: J 58%, K 17%, Q 8%, R 8%, L 8%.
Syria: J 39%, E 29%, R 14%, G 14%, K 4%.
Maternal MtDNA haplogroup frequencies: H 32%, X 13%, K 12.5%, U 10%, T 7.5%, HV 4.8%, J 4.8%, I 3.5%, pre HV 3%, L2a3 2.25%, N1b 2.25%, M1 1.6%, W 1.29%.
In a principal component analysis of a 2014 study, Druze were located between Lebanese people and Mizrahi Jews.
According to a 2015 study, Druze have a largely similar genome with Middle Eastern Arabs, but they have not married outside of their clans in 1000 years and Druze families from different regions share a similarity with each other that distinguishes them from other Middle Eastern populations.
A 2016 study based on testing samples of Druze in the historic region of Syria, in comparison with ancient humans (including Anatolian and Armenian), and on Geographic Population Structure (GPS) tool by converting genetic distances into geographic distances, concluded that Druze might hail from the Zagros Mountains and the surroundings of Lake Van in eastern Anatolia, then they later migrated south to settle in the mountainous regions in Syria, Lebanon and Israel.
A 2020 study on remains from Canaanaite (Bronze Age southern Levantine) populations suggests a significant degree of genetic continuity in currently Arabic-speaking Levantine populations (including the Druze, Lebanese, Palestinians, and Syrians), as well as in most Jewish groups (including Sephardi Jews, Ashkenazi Jews, Mizrahi Jews, and Maghrebi Jews) from the populations of the Bronze Age Levant, suggesting that the aforementioned groups all derive more than half of their overall ancestry (atDNA) from Canaanite / Bronze Age Levantine populations, albeit with varying sources and degrees of admixture from differing host or invading populations depending on each group.

In a 2021 study, Druze were a part of the larger Levant-Iraq cluster in a fineSTRUCTURE tree analysis, and overlapped with Lebanese people in a principal component analysis.

Statistics
U.S. states by Buddhist population
Hawaii has the largest Buddhist population by percentage, amounting to 8% of the state's population. California follows Hawaii with 2%. Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wyoming have a Buddhist population of 1%.
The Buddhist population rapidly increased in the 1960s with the change in Asian immigration law to the United States. By the 1980's, multiple Buddhist communities began to sprout throughout the country.

Buddhism in American Overseas territories
The following is the percentage of Buddhists in the U.S. territories as of 2010:

Types of Buddhism in the United States
Three broad types of American Buddhism are found in the United States:

The oldest and largest of these is ""immigrant"" or ""ethnic Buddhism"", those Buddhist traditions that came to America with immigrants who were already practitioners and that largely remained with those immigrants and their descendants.
The next oldest and arguably the most visible group Prebish refers to as ""import Buddhists"", because they came to America largely in response to interested American converts who sought them out, either by going abroad or by supporting foreign teachers; this is sometimes also called ""elite Buddhism"" because its practitioners, especially early ones, tended to come from social elites.
A trend in Buddhism is ""export"" or ""evangelical Buddhist"" groups based in another country who actively recruit members in the US from various backgrounds. Modern Buddhism is not just an American phenomenon.
This typology has been the subject of debate among scholars who have noted the problematic nature of equating ""ethnic"" Buddhists with Asian immigrants which elides the ethnicity or cultural specificity of white American Buddhists.

Immigrant Buddhism
Buddhism was introduced into the US by Asian immigrants in the 19th century, when significant numbers of immigrants from East Asia began to arrive in the New World. In the United States, immigrants from China entered around 1820, but began to arrive in large numbers following the 1849 California Gold Rush.
Immigrant Buddhist congregations in North America are as diverse as the different peoples of Asian Buddhist extraction who settled there. The US is home to Sri Lankan Buddhists, Chinese Buddhists, Japanese Buddhists, Korean Buddhists, Thai Buddhists, Cambodian Buddhists, Vietnamese Buddhists and Buddhists with family backgrounds in most Buddhist countries and regions. The Immigration Act of 1965 increased the number of immigrants arriving from China, Vietnam and the Theravada-practicing countries of Southeast Asia.

Chinese immigration
The first Buddhist temple in America was built in 1853 in San Francisco by the Sze Yap Company, a Chinese American fraternal society. Another society, the Ning Yeong Company, built a second in 1854; by 1875, there were eight temples, and by 1900 approximately 400 Chinese temples on the west coast of the United States, most of them containing some Buddhist elements. Unfortunately a casualty of racism, these temples were often the subject of suspicion and ignorance by the rest of the population, and were dismissively called joss houses.

Japanese and Korean immigration
The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 curtailed growth of the Chinese American population, but large-scale immigration from Japan began in the late 1880s and from Korea around 1903. In both cases, immigration was at first primarily to Hawai‘i. Populations from other Asian Buddhist countries followed, and in each case, the new communities established Buddhist temples and organizations. For instance, the first sanctioned Japanese temple in Hawai‘i, the Hāmākua Bukkyo Kaido (later renamed as the Hāmākua Jodo Mission), was built in 1896 by the Jōdo-shū school under the guidance of Reverend Gakuo Okabe. In 1898, Japanese missionaries and immigrants established a Young Men's Buddhist Association, and the Rev. Sōryū Kagahi was dispatched from Japan to be the first Buddhist missionary to Hawai‘i. The first Japanese Buddhist temple in the continental U.S. was built in San Francisco in 1899, and the first in Canada was built at the Ishikawa Hotel in Vancouver in 1905. The first Buddhist clergy to take up residence in the continental U.S. were Shuye Sonoda and Kakuryo Nishimjima, missionaries from Japan who arrived in 1899.

Contemporary Immigrant Buddhism
Japanese Buddhism
Buddhist Churches of America
The Buddhist Churches of America and the Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawaii are immigrant Buddhist organizations in the United States. The BCA is an affiliate of Japan's Nishi Hongwanji, a sect of Jōdo Shinshū, which is, in turn, a form of Pure Land Buddhism. Tracing its roots to the Young Men's Buddhist Association founded in San Francisco at the end of the 19th century and the Buddhist Mission of North America founded in 1899, it took its current form in 1944. All of the Buddhist Mission's leadership, along with almost the entire Japanese American population, had been interned during World War II. The name Buddhist Churches of America was adopted at Topaz War Relocation Center in Utah; the word ""church"" was used in analogy to a Christian house of worship. After internment ended, some members returned to the West Coast and revitalized churches there, while a number of others moved to the Midwest and built new churches. During the 1960s and 1970s, the BCA was in a growth phase and was very successful at fund-raising. It also published two periodicals, one in Japanese and one in English. However, since 1980, BCA membership declined. The 36 temples in the state of Hawaii of the Honpa Hongwanji Mission have a similar history. 
While a majority of the Buddhist Churches of America's membership are ethnically Japanese, some members have non-Asian backgrounds. Thus, it has limited aspects of export Buddhism. As involvement by its ethnic community declined, internal discussions advocated attracting the broader public.

Nichiren buddhism
Soka Gakkai, which means ""Value Creation Society"", is one of three sects of Nichiren Buddhism. It is considered a new religious movement from Japan that expanded after World War II. Soka Gakkai came to the United States with Daisaku Ikeda in the mid-20th century. Because of a rift with Nichiren Shōshū in 1991, the SGI has no priests of its own. Its main religious practice is chanting the mantra Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō and sections of the Lotus Sutra. Unlike schools such as Zen, Vipassanā, and Tibetan Buddhism, Soka Gakkai Buddhists do not practice meditative techniques other than chanting.

Taiwanese Buddhism
Another US Buddhist institution is Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California. Hsi Lai is the American headquarters of Fo Guang Shan, a modern Buddhist group in Taiwan. Hsi Lai was built in 1988 at a cost of $10 million and is often described as the largest Buddhist temple in the Western hemisphere. Although it caters primarily to Chinese Americans, it also has regular services and outreach programs in English.

Growth of Buddhist philosophy in America
While Asian immigrants were arriving, some American intellectuals examined Buddhism, based primarily on information from British colonies in India and East Asia.
In the last century, numbers of Asian Buddhist masters and teachers have immigrated to the U.S. in order to propagate their beliefs and practices. Most have belonged to three major Buddhist traditions or cultures: Zen, Tibetan, and Theravadan.

Early translations
The Englishmen William Jones and Charles Wilkins translated Sanskrit texts into English. The American Transcendentalists Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Walt Whitman, took an interest in Hindu and Buddhist philosophy. They were among the first western writers to have access to translated Hindu and Buddhist texts. In 1844, The Dial, a small literary publication edited by Thoreau and Emerson, published an English version of a portion of the Lotus Sutra; it had been translated by Dial business manager Elizabeth Palmer Peabody from a French version recently completed by Eugène Burnouf. His Indian readings may have influenced his later experiments in simple living: at one point in Walden Thoreau wrote: ""I realized what the Orientals meant by contemplation and the forsaking of works."" Poet Walt Whitman also references Indian religions in his writing. In Whitman's well-known poem ""Passage to India"", he refers to Indian rivers, history and theology.

Theosophical Society
An early American to publicly convert to Buddhism was Henry Steel Olcott. Olcott, a former U.S. army colonel during the Civil War, had grown interested in reports of supernatural phenomena that were popular in the late 19th century. In 1875, he, Helena Blavatsky, and William Quan Judge founded the Theosophical Society, dedicated to the study of the occult and influenced by Hindu and Buddhist scriptures. The leaders claimed to believe that they were in contact, via visions and messages, with a secret order of adepts called the ""Himalayan Brotherhood"" or ""the Masters"". In 1879, Olcott and Blavatsky traveled to India and in 1880, to Sri Lanka, where they were met enthusiastically by local Buddhists, who saw them as allies against an aggressive Christian missionary movement. On May 25, Olcott and Blavatsky took the pancasila vows of a lay Buddhist before a monk and a large crowd. Although most of the Theosophists appear to have counted themselves as Buddhists, they held idiosyncratic beliefs that separated them from known Buddhist traditions; only Olcott was enthusiastic about following mainstream Buddhism. He returned twice to Sri Lanka, where he promoted Buddhist education, and visited Japan and Burma. Olcott authored a Buddhist Catechism, stating his view of the basic tenets of the religion.
Several publications increased knowledge of Buddhism in 19th-century America. In 1879, Edwin Arnold, an English aristocrat, published The Light of Asia, an epic poem he had written about the life and teachings of the Buddha, expounded with much wealth of local color and not a little felicity of versification. The book became immensely popular in the United States, going through eighty editions and selling more than 500,000 copies.

Paul Carus
Paul Carus, a German American philosopher and theologian, was at work on a more scholarly prose treatment of the same subject. Carus was the director of Open Court Publishing Company, an academic publisher specializing in philosophy, science, and religion, and editor of The Monist, a journal with a similar focus, both based in La Salle, Illinois. In 1894, Carus published The Gospel of Buddha, compiled from a variety of Asian texts which, true to its name, presented the Buddha's story in a form resembling the Christian Gospels. Carus was acclaimed among Asian clerics for his understanding of Buddhism. In a letter to S. Sonoda in San Francisco, Carus wrote ""breathe the true spirit of Buddhism and yet be adapted to Western ways of thought"".

Early spread
In 1887, The Buddhist Ray appeared, a Santa Cruz, California-based magazine published and edited by Phillangi Dasa, born Herman Carl (or Carl Herman) Veetering (or Vettering), a recluse about whom little is known. The Ray's tone was ""ironic, light, saucy, self-assured ... one-hundred-percent American Buddhist"". It ceased publication in 1894. 
In 1893, the Parliament of the World's Religions hosted a number of Buddhist delegates, including the Zen master Soyen Shaku and the Sri Lankan Buddhist revivalist Anagarika Dharmapala. Shaku contrasted the idea of karma as a principle of causality with the ""Prime Mover"" nature of the Christian God, while Dharmapala challenged the idea of Christianity as a ""universal religion"" by comparing it to the more ancient and ""universal"" teachings of the Buddha.
In 1900 six white San Franciscans, working with Japanese Jodo Shinshu missionaries, established the Dharma Sangha of Buddha and published a bimonthly magazine, The Light of Dharma. In Illinois, Paul Carus wrote more books about Buddhism and set portions of Buddhist scripture to Western classical music.
By 1970, most all sects of Asian Buddhism were present in America. Don Morreale's 1988 catalogue of Buddhist America: Centers, Retreats, Practices had 350 pages of listings.

Dwight Goddard
One American who attempted to establish an American Buddhist movement was Dwight Goddard (1861–1939). Goddard was a Christian missionary to China when he first came in contact with Buddhism. In 1928, he spent a year living at a Zen monastery in Japan. In 1934, he founded ""The Followers of Buddha, an American Brotherhood"", with the goal of applying the traditional monastic structure of Buddhism more strictly than Senzaki and Sokei-an. The group was largely unsuccessful: no Americans were recruited to join as monks and attempts failed to attract a Chinese Chan (Zen) master to come to the United States. However, Goddard's efforts as an author and publisher bore considerable fruit. In 1930, he began publishing ZEN: A Buddhist Magazine. In 1932, he collaborated with D. T. Suzuki on a translation of the Lankavatara Sutra. That same year, he published the first edition of A Buddhist Bible, an anthology of Buddhist scriptures focusing on those used in Chinese and Japanese Zen.

Zen
Japanese Rinzai
Zen was introduced to the United States by Japanese priests who were sent to serve local immigrant groups. A small group also came to study the American culture and way of life.

Early Rinzai-teachers
In 1893, Soyen Shaku was invited to speak at the Parliament of the World's Religions held in Chicago. During his talks, Shaku he challenged his mostly Christian audience's notions of religion and presented Zen Buddhism as rational, nontheistic, and compatible with modern science. In 1905, Shaku was invited to stay in the United States by a wealthy American couple. He lived for nine months near San Francisco, where he established a small zendo in the home of Alexander and Ida Russell and gave regular zazen lessons, making him the first Zen Buddhist priest to teach in North America.
Shaku was followed by Nyogen Senzaki, a young monk from Shaku's home temple in Japan. Senzaki briefly worked for the Russells and then as a hotel porter, manager and eventually, owner. In 1922 Senzaki rented a hall and gave an English talk on a paper by Shaku; his periodic talks at different locations became known as the ""floating zendo"". Senzaki established an itinerant sitting hall from San Francisco to Los Angeles in California, where he taught until his death in 1958.
Sokatsu Shaku, one of Shaku's senior students, arrived in late 1906, founding a Zen meditation center called Ryomokyo-kai. One of his disciples, Shigetsu Sasaki, better known under his monastic name Sokei-an, came to New York to teach. In 1931, his small group incorporated as the Buddhist Society of America, later renamed the First Zen Institute of America. By the late 1930s, one of his most active supporters was Ruth Fuller Everett, an American socialite and the mother-in-law of Alan Watts. Shortly before Sokei-an's death in 1945, he and Everett would wed, at which point she took the name Ruth Fuller Sasaki.

D.T. Suzuki
D.T. Suzuki had a great literary impact. Through English language essays and books, such as Essays in Zen Buddhism (1927), he became a visible expositor of Zen Buddhism and its unofficial ambassador to Western readers. In 1951, Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki returned to the United States to take a visiting professorship at Columbia University, where his open lectures attracted members of the literary, artistic, and cultural elite.

Beat Zen
In the mid-1950s, writers associated with the Beat Generation took a serious interest in Zen, including Gary Snyder, Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and Kenneth Rexroth, which increased its visibility. Prior to that, Philip Whalen had interest as early as 1946, and D. T. Suzuki began lecturing on Buddhism at Columbia in 1950. By 1958, anticipating Kerouac's publication of The Dharma Bums by three months, Time magazine said, ""Zen Buddhism is growing more chic by the minute.""

Contemporary Rinzai
Contemporary Rinzai Zen teachers in United States have included Kyozan Joshu Sasaki Roshi, Eido Tai Shimano Roshi, and Omori Sogen Roshi (d. 1994). Sasaki founded the Mount Baldy Zen Center and its branches after coming to Los Angeles from Japan in 1962. One of his students is the Canadian poet and musician Leonard Cohen. Eido Roshi founded Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-ji, a training center in New York state. Omori Roshi founded Daihonzan Chozen-ji, the first Rinzai headquarters temple established outside Japan, in Honolulu; under his students Tenshin Tanouye Roshi and Dogen Hosokawa Roshi and their dharma heirs, several other training centers were established including Daiyuzenji in Chicago and Korinji in Wisconsin.
In 1998 Sherry Chayat, born in Brooklyn, became the first American woman to receive transmission in the Rinzai school of Buddhism.

Japanese Sōtō
Soyu Matsuoka
In the 1930s Soyu Matsuoka-roshi was sent to America by Sōtōshū, to establish the Sōtō Zen tradition in the United States. He established the Chicago Buddhist Temple in 1949. Matsuoka-roshi also served as superintendent and abbot of the Long Beach Zen Buddhist Temple and Zen Center. He relocated from Chicago to establish a temple at Long Beach in 1971 after leaving the Zen Buddhist Temple of Chicago to his dharma heir Kongo Richard Langlois, Roshi. He returned to Chicago in 1995, where he died in 1998.

Shunryu Suzuki
Sōtō Zen priest Shunryu Suzuki (no relation to D.T. Suzuki), who was the son of a Sōtō priest, was sent to San Francisco in the late 1950s on a three-year temporary assignment to care for an established Japanese congregation at the Sōtō temple, Soko-ji. Suzuki also taught zazen or sitting meditation which soon attracted American students and ""beatniks"", who formed a core of students who in 1962 would create the San Francisco Zen Center and its eventual network of highly influential Zen centers across the country, including the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, the first Buddhist monastery in the Western world. He provided innovation and creativity during San Francisco's countercultural movement of the 1960s but he died in 1971. His low-key teaching style was described in the popular book Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind, a compilation of his talks.

Tozen Akiyama
Ordained in 1974 in Japan by Tosui Ohta, came to the United States in 1983, initially posted to Zenshuji in Los Angeles. In 1985 he became the abbot of Milwaukee Zen Center, which he led and developed until 2000. He has three dharma heirs: Jisho Warner in California, abiding teacher of Stone Creek Zen Center; Tonen Sara O'Connor in Wisconsin, former head priest of Milwaukee Zen Center; and Toshu Neatrour in Idaho.

White Plum Sangha
Taizan Maezumi arrived as a young priest to serve at Zenshuji, the North American Sōtō sect headquarters in Los Angeles, in 1956. Maezumi received dharma transmission (shiho) from Baian Hakujun Kuroda, his father and high-ranked Sōtō priest, in 1955. By the mid-1960s he had formed a regular zazen group. In 1967, he and his supporters founded the Zen Center of Los Angeles. Further, he received teaching permission (inka) from Koryu Osaka – a Rinzai teacher – and from Yasutani Hakuun of the Sanbo Kyodan. Maezumi, in turn, had several American dharma heirs, such as Bernie Glassman, John Daido Loori, Charlotte Joko Beck, William Nyogen Yeo, and Dennis Genpo Merzel. His successors and their network of centers became the White Plum Sangha. In 2006 Merle Kodo Boyd, born in Texas, became the first African-American woman ever to receive Dharma transmission in Zen Buddhism.

Sanbo Kyodan
Sanbo Kyodan is a contemporary Japanese Zen lineage which had an impact in the West disproportionate to its size in Japan. It is rooted in the reformist teachings of Harada Daiun Sogaku (1871–1961) and his disciple Yasutani Hakuun (1885–1971), who argued that the existing Zen institutions of Japan (Sōtō and Rinzai sects) had become complacent and were generally unable to convey real Dharma.

Philip Kapleau
Sanbo Kyodan's first American member was Philip Kapleau, who first traveled to Japan in 1945 as a court reporter for the war crimes trials. In 1953, he returned to Japan, where he met with Nakagawa Soen, a protégé of Nyogen Senzaki. In 1965, he published a book, The Three Pillars of Zen, which recorded a set of talks by Yasutani outlining his approach to practice, along with transcripts of dokusan interviews and some additional texts. In 1965 Kapleau returned to America and, in 1966, established the Rochester Zen Center in Rochester, New York. In 1967, Kapleau had a falling-out with Yasutani over Kapleau's moves to Americanize his temple, after which it became independent of Sanbo Kyodan. One of Kapleau's early disciples was Toni Packer, who left Rochester in 1981 to found a nonsectarian meditation center, not specifically Buddhist or Zen.

Robert Aitken
Robert Aitken was introduced to Zen as a prisoner in Japan during World War II. After returning to the United States, he studied with Nyogen Senzaki in Los Angeles in the early 1950s. In 1959, while still a Zen student, he founded the Diamond Sangha, a zendo in Honolulu, Hawaii. Aitken became a dharma heir of Yamada's, authored more than ten books, and developed the Diamond Sangha into an international network with temples in the United States, Argentina, Germany, and Australia. In 1995, he and his organization split with Sanbo Kyodan in response to reorganization of the latter following Yamada's death. The Pacific Zen Institute led by John Tarrant, Aitken's first Dharma successor, continues as an independent Zen line.

Chinese Chán
There are also Zen teachers of Chinese Chán, Korean Seon, and Vietnamese Thien.

Hsuan Hua
In 1962, Hsuan Hua moved to San Francisco's Chinatown, where, in addition to Zen, he taught Chinese Pure Land, Tiantai, Vinaya, and Vajrayana Buddhism. Initially, his students were mostly westerners, but he eventually attracted a range of followers.

Sheng-yen
Sheng-yen first visited the United States in 1978 under the sponsorship of the Buddhist Association of the United States, an organization of Chinese American Buddhists. In 1980, he founded the Chán Meditation Society in Queens, New York. In 1985, he founded the Chung-hwa Institute of Buddhist Studies in Taiwan, which sponsors Chinese Zen activities in the United States.

Korean Seon
Seung Sahn was a temple abbot in Seoul. After living in Hong Kong and Japan, he moved to the US in 1972 (not speaking any English) to establish the Kwan Um School of Zen. Shortly after arriving in Providence, he attracted students and founded the Providence Zen Center. The Kwan Um School has more than 100 Zen centers on six continents.
Another Korean Zen teacher, Samu Sunim, founded Toronto's Zen Buddhist Temple in 1971. He was head of the Buddhist Society for Compassionate Wisdom, which has temples in Ann Arbor, Chicago, Toronto, Mexico City, and New York City, along with a retreat center in Upstate New York. 
Hye Am (1884–1985) brought lineage Dharma to the United States. Hye Am's Dharma successor, Myo Vong founded the Western Son Academy (1976), and his Korean disciple, Pohwa Sunim, founded World Zen Fellowship (1994) which includes various Zen centers in the United States, such as the Potomac Zen Sangha, the Patriarchal Zen Society and the Baltimore Zen Center.
Recently, Korean Buddhist monks have come to the United States to spread the Dharma. They are establishing temples and zen (Korean, 'Seon') centers all around the United States. For example, Hyeonho established the Goryosah Temple in Los Angeles in 1979, and Muil Woohak founded the Budzen Center in New York.

Vietnamese Thien
Vietnamese Zen (Thiền) teachers in America include Thích Thiên-Ân and Thích Nhất Hạnh. Thích Thiên-Ân came to America in 1966 as a visiting professor at UCLA and taught traditional Thiền meditation.

Thích Nhất Hạnh
Thích Nhất Hạnh was a monk in Vietnam during the Vietnam War. In 1966, he left Vietnam in exile and founded the Plum Village Monastery in France. In his books and talks, Thích Nhất Hạnh emphasizes mindfulness (sati) as the most important practice in daily life. His monastic students live and practice at three centers in the United States: Deer Park Monastery in Escondido, California, Blue Cliff Monastery in Pine Bush, New York, and Magnolia Grove Monastery in Batesville, Mississippi.

Tibetan Buddhism
Perhaps the most widely visible Buddhist leader in the world is Tenzin Gyatso, the current Dalai Lama, who first visited the United States in 1979. As the exiled political leader of Tibet, he has become a popular cause célèbre, attracting celebrity religious followers such as Richard Gere and Adam Yauch. His early life was depicted in Hollywood films such as Kundun and Seven Years in Tibet. An early Western-born Tibetan Buddhist monk was Robert A. F. Thurman, now an academic supporter of the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama maintains a North American headquarters in Ithaca, New York.
The Dalai Lama's family has strong ties to America. His brother Thubten Norbu fled China after being asked to assassinate his brother. He was himself a Lama, the Takster Rinpoche, and an abbot of the Kumbum Monastery in Tibet's Amdo region. He settled in Bloomington, Indiana, where he later founded the Tibetan Mongolian Buddhist Cultural Center and Kumbum Chamtse Ling Temple. Since the death of the Takster Rinpoche it has served as a Kumbum of the West, with the current Arija Rinpochere serving as its leader.
Dilowa Gegen (Diluu Khudagt) was the first lama to immigrate to the United States in 1949 as a political refugee and joined Owen Lattimore's Mongolia Project. He was born in Tudevtei, Zavkhan, Mongolia and was one of the leading figures in declaration of independence of Mongolia. He was exiled from Mongolia, the reason remains unrevealed to this day. After arriving in the US, he joined Johns Hopkins University and founded a monastery in New Jersey.

The first Tibetan Buddhist lama to have American students was Geshe Ngawang Wangyal, a Kalmyk-Mongolian of the Gelug lineage, who came to the United States in 1955 and founded the ""Lamaist Buddhist Monastery of America"" in New Jersey in 1958. Among his students were the future western scholars Robert Thurman, Jeffrey Hopkins, Alexander Berzin and Anne C. Klein. Other early arrivals included Dezhung Rinpoche, a Sakya lama who settled in Seattle, in 1960, and Tarthang Tulku Rinpoche, the first Nyingma teacher in America, who arrived in the US in 1968 and established the ""Tibetan Nyingma Meditation Center"" in Berkeley, California, in 1969.
A well known Tibetan Buddhist lama to live in the United States was Chögyam Trungpa. Trungpa, part of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism, moved to England in 1963, founded a temple in Scotland, and then relocated to Barnet, Vermont, and then Boulder, Colorado, by 1970. He established what he named Dharmadhatu meditation centers, eventually organized under a national umbrella group called Vajradhatu (renamed Shambhala International in February 2000). He developed a series of secular techniques he called Shambhala Training. Following Trungpa's death, his followers at the Rocky Mountain Shambhala Center built the Great Stupa of Dharmakaya, a traditional reliquary monument, near Red Feather Lakes, Colorado, consecrated in 2001.

There are four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism: the Gelug, the Kagyu, the Nyingma, and the Sakya. Of these, the greatest impact in the West was made by the Gelug, led by the Dalai Lama, and the Kagyu, specifically its Karma Kagyu branch, led by the Karmapa. In 1974 Trungpa Rinpoche and Kalu Rinpoche invited the 16th Karmapa to the united States. As of the early 1990s, there were several significant strands of Kagyu practice in the United States: Chögyam Trungpa's Shambhala movement; Karma Triyana Dharmachakra, a network of centers affiliated directly with the Karmapa's North American seat in Woodstock, New York; a network of centers founded by Kalu Rinpoche; a number of centers dedicated to mahamudra study and practice founded by Thrangu Rinpoche. The Drikung Kagyu lineage also has an established presence in the United States. Khenchen Konchog Gyaltsen arrived in the US in 1982 and planted the seeds for multiple Drikung centers across the country. He also paved the way for the arrival of Garchen Rinpoche, who established the Garchen Buddhist Institute in Chino Valley, Arizona. In 1990, Mahamudra Meditation Center was founded by Peter F. Barth, under the guidance of Thrangu Rinpoche and Khenchen Konchog Gyaltsen.
Diamond Way Buddhism founded by Lama Ole Nydahl and Hannah Nydahl, and under the spiritual guidance of Thaye Dorje, is also active in the US. The focus is on making Karma Kagyu teachings and methods available to modern and independent thinkers in the West. In 1972, the 16th Karmapa Rangjung Rigpe Dorje requested Lama Ole Nydhal and Hannah Nydhal to establish Buddhist centers of the Karma Kagyu lineage in the Western world. Lama Ole Nydahl offered Buddhist refuge to tens of thousands of people and founded 640 Buddhist centers around the world.
In the 21st century, the Nyingma lineage is increasingly represented in the West by both Western and Tibetan teachers. Lama Surya Das is a Western-born teacher carrying on the ""great rimé"", a non-sectarian form of Tibetan Buddhism. The late Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche founded centers in Seattle and Brazil. Gochen Tulku Sangak (sometimes spelled ""Sang-Ngag"") Rinpoche is the founder and spiritual director of the first Ewam International Center located in the US. He is also the spiritual director of the Namchak Foundation in Montana and a primary lineage holder of the Namchak lineage. Khandro Rinpoche is a female Tibetan teacher who has a presence in America. Jetsunma Ahkon Lhamo is the first Western woman to be enthroned as a Tulku, and established Nyingma Kunzang Palyul Choling centers in Sedona, Arizona, and Poolesville, Maryland.
The Gelug tradition is represented in America by the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition (FPMT), founded by Lama Thubten Yeshe and Lama Zopa. Gelugpa teacher Geshe Michael Roach, the first American to be awarded a Geshe degree, established centers in New York and at Diamond Mountain University in Arizona.
Sravasti Abbey is the first Tibetan Buddhist monastery for Western monks and nuns in the U.S., established in Washington State by Bhikshuni Thubten Chodron in 2003. It is situated on 300 acres of forest and meadows, 11 miles (18 km) outside of Newport, Washington, near the Idaho state line. It is open to visitors who want to learn about community life in a Tibetan Buddhist monastic setting. The name Sravasti Abbey was chosen by the Dalai Lama. Bhikshuni Thubten Chodron had suggested the name, as Sravasti was the place in India where the Buddha spent 25 rains retreats (varsa in Sanskrit and yarne in Tibetan), and communities of both nuns and monks had resided there. This seemed auspicious to ensure the Buddha's teachings would be abundantly available to both male and female monastics at the monastery.
Sravasti Abbey is notable because it is home to a growing group of fully ordained bhikshunis (Buddhist nuns) practicing in the Tibetan tradition. This is special because the tradition of full ordination for women was not transmitted from India to Tibet. Ordained women practicing in the Tibetan tradition usually hold a novice ordination. Venerable Thubten Chodron, while faithfully following the teachings of her Tibetan teachers, has arranged for her students to seek full ordination as bhikshunis in Taiwan.
In January 2014, the Abbey, which then had seven bhikshunis and three novices, formally began its first winter varsa (three-month monastic retreat), which lasted until April 13, 2014. As far as the Abbey knows, this was the first time a Western bhikshuni sangha practicing in the Tibetan tradition had done this ritual in the United States and in English. On April 19, 2014, the Abbey held its first kathina ceremony to mark the end of the varsa. Also in 2014 the Abbey held its first Pavarana rite at the end of the varsa.  In October 2015 the Annual Western Buddhist Monastic Gathering was held at the Abbey for the first time; it was the 21st such gathering.
In 2006, Geshe Thupten Dorjee, educated at Drepung Loseling Monastery, and poet Sidney Burris founded the Tibetan Cultural Institute of Arkansas, which began offering two weekly meditation courses and bringing monks and scholars to give lectures to the community at large. In 2008, the TEXT (Tibetans in Exile Today) Program at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville began an oral history project to help archive the stories of Tibetans currently living in exile in India. In June 2011, a month after the Dalai Lama visited, TCIA received a donation to build a retreat center and stupa near Crosses, Arkansas.
In 2010 the first Tibetan Buddhist nunnery in North America was established in Vermont, called Vajra Dakini Nunnery, offering novice ordination. The abbot of this nunnery is an American woman named Khenmo Drolma who is the first ""bhikkhunni"", a fully ordained Buddhist nun, in the Drikung Kagyu tradition of Buddhism, having been ordained in Taiwan in 2002. She is also the first westerner, male or female, to be installed as a Buddhist abbot, having been installed as abbot of Vajra Dakini Nunnery in 2004.

Theravada
Theravada is best known for Vipassana, roughly translated as ""insight meditation"", which is an ancient meditative practice described in the Pali Canon of the Theravada school of Buddhism and similar scriptures. Vipassana also refers to a distinct movement which was begun in the 20th century by reformers such as Mahāsi Sayādaw, a Burmese monk. Mahāsi Sayādaw was a Theravada bhikkhu and Vipassana is rooted in the Theravada teachings, but its goal is to simplify ritual and other peripheral activities in order to make meditative practice more effective and available both to monks and to laypeople.

American Theravada Buddhists
In 1965, monks from Sri Lanka established the Washington Buddhist Vihara in Washington, DC, the first Theravada monastic community in the United States. The Vihara was accessible to English-speakers with Vipassana meditation part of its activities. However, the direct influence of the Vipassana movement would not reach the U.S. until a group of Americans returned there in the early 1970s after studying with Vipassana masters in Asia.
Joseph Goldstein, after journeying to Southeast Asia with the Peace Corps, lived in Bodhgaya as a student of Anagarika Munindra, the head monk of Mahabodhi Temple and himself a student of Māhāsai Sayādaw. Jack Kornfield also worked for the Peace Corps in Southeast Asia, and then studied and ordained in the Thai Forest Tradition under Ajahn Chah, a major figure in 20th-century Thai Buddhism. Sharon Salzberg went to India in 1971 and studied with Dipa Ma, a former Calcutta housewife trained in vipassana by Māhāsai Sayādaw. The Thai Forest Tradition also has a number of branch monasteries in the United States, including Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery (Ajahn Pasanno, Abbot), Metta Forest Monastery (with Thanissaro Bhikkhu as Abbot) and Jetavana Temple Forest Monastery.
Goldstein and Kornfield met in 1974 while teaching at the Naropa Institute in Colorado. The next year, Goldstein, Kornfield, and Salzberg, who had very recently returned from Calcutta, along with Jacqueline Schwarz, founded the Insight Meditation Society on an 80-acre (324,000 m2) property near Barre, Massachusetts. IMS hosted visits by Māhāsi Sayādaw, Munindra, Ajahn Chah, and Dipa Ma. In 1981, Kornfield moved to California, where he founded another Vipassana center, Spirit Rock Meditation Center, in Marin County. In 1985, Larry Rosenberg founded the Cambridge Insight Meditation Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Another Vipassana center is the Vipassana Metta Foundation, located on Maui. ""When a Retreat Center course is in progress, anyone who is not already participating in the retreat is welcome to attend the evening talks about the teachings, known as Dharma talks. Those with insight meditation experience are also welcome to attend group sittings."" Dharma talks are available for free download, a service provided by Dharma Seed.
In 1989, the Insight Meditation Center established the Barre Center for Buddhist Studies near the IMS headquarters, to promote scholarly investigation of Buddhism. Its first director was Mu Soeng, a former Korean Zen monk.
In the early 1990s, Ajahn Amaro made several teaching trips to northern California. Many who attended his meditation retreats became enthusiastic about the possibility of establishing a permanent monastic community in the area. In the meantime, Amaravati Monastery in England received a substantial donation of land in Mendocino County from Chan Master Hsuan Hua. The land was allocated to establish a forest monastery. Abhayagiri Monastery was established and placed in the hands of a group of lay practitioners, the Sanghapala Foundation. Ajahn Pasanno moved to California on New Year's Eve of 1997 to share the abbotship of Abhayagiri Monastery, Redwood Valley, California, with Ajahn Amaro.
In 1997 Dhamma Cetiya Vihara in Boston was founded by Ven. Gotami of Thailand, then a 10 precept nun. Ven. Gotami received full ordination in 2000, at which time her dwelling became America's first Theravada Buddhist bhikkhuni vihara. ""Vihara"" translates as monastery or nunnery, and may be both dwelling and community center where one or more bhikkhus or bhikkhunis offer teachings on Buddhist scriptures, conduct traditional ceremonies, teach meditation, offer counseling and other community services, receive alms, and reside. More recently established Theravada bhikkhuni viharas include: Mahapajapati Monastery where several nuns (bhikkhunis and novices) live together in the desert of southern California near Joshua Tree, founded by Ven. Gunasari Bhikkhuni of Burma in 2008; Aranya Bodhi Hermitage founded by Ven. Tathaaloka Bhikkhuni in the forest near Jenner, CA, with Ven. Sobhana Bhikkhuni as Prioress, which opened officially in July 2010, where several bhikkhunis reside together along with trainees and lay supporters; and Sati Saraniya in Ontario, founded by Ven. Medhanandi in appx 2009, where two bhikkhunis reside. In 2009 Aloka Vihara Forest Monastery in the Sierra Foothills of California was created by Ayya Anandabodhi and Ayya Santacitta. (There are also quiet residences of individual bhikkhunis where they may receive visitors and give teachings, such as the residence of Ven. Amma Thanasanti Bhikkhuni in 2009–2010 in Colorado Springs; and the Los Angeles residence of Ven. Susila Bhikkhuni; and the residence of Ven. Wimala Bhikkhuni in the mid-west.)
In 2010, in Northern California, four novice nuns were given the full bhikkhuni ordination in the Thai Theravada tradition, which included the double ordination ceremony. Bhante Gunaratana and other monks and nuns were in attendance. It was the first such ordination ever in the Western hemisphere.
Bhante Gunaratana is currently the abbot of the Bhavana Society, a monastery and meditation retreat center that he founded in High View, West Virginia.

S. N. Goenka
S. N. Goenka was a Burmese-born meditation teacher of the Vipassana movement. His teacher, Sayagyi U Ba Khin of Burma, was a contemporary of Māhāsi Sayādaw's, and taught a style of Buddhism with similar emphasis on simplicity and accessibility to laypeople. Goenka established a method of instruction popular in Asia and throughout the world. In 1981, he established the Vipassana Research Institute in Igatpuri, India, and his students built several centers in North America.

Association of American Buddhists
The Association of American Buddhists was a group which promotes Buddhism through publications, ordination of monks, and classes.
Organized in 1960 by American practitioners of Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana Buddhism, it does not espouse any particular school or schools of Buddhism. It respects all Buddhist traditions as equal, and encourages unity of Buddhism in thought and practice. It states that a different, American, form of Buddhism is possible, and that the cultural forms attached to the older schools of Buddhism need not necessarily be followed by westerners.

Women and Buddhism
Rita M. Gross, a feminist religious scholar, claims that multiple people converted to Buddhism in the 1960s and 1970s as an attempt to combat traditional American values. However, in their conversion, they have created a new form of Buddhism distinctly Western in thought and practice. Democratization and the rise of women in leadership positions have been among the most influential characteristics of American Buddhism. However, another one of these characteristics is rationalism, which has allowed Buddhists to come to terms with the scientific and technological advances of the 21st century. Engagement in social issues, such as global warming, domestic violence, poverty and discrimination, has also shaped Buddhism in America. Privatization of ritual practices into home life has embodied Buddhism in America. The idea of living in the ""present life"" rather than focusing on the future or the past is also another characteristic of American Buddhism.
American Buddhism was able to embed these new religious ideals into such a historically rich religious tradition and culture due to the high conversion rate in the late 20th century. Three important factors led to this conversion in America: the importance of religion, societal openness, and spirituality. American culture places a large emphasis on having a personal religious identity as a spiritual and ethical foundation. During the 1960s and onward, society also became more open to other religious practices outside of Protestantism, allowing more people to explore Buddhism. People also became more interested in spiritual and experiential religion rather than the traditional institutional religions of the time.
The mass conversion of the 60s and 70s was also occurring alongside the second-wave feminist movement. While some of the women who became Buddhists at this time were drawn to its ""gender neutral"" teachings, in reality Buddhism is a traditionally patriarchal religion. These two conflicting ideas caused ""uneasiness"" with American Buddhist women. This uneasiness was further justified after 1983, when some male Buddhist teachers were exposed as ""sexual adventurers and abusers of power."" This spurred action among women in the American Buddhist community. After much dialogue within the community, including a series of conferences entitled ""The Feminine in Buddhism"", Sandy Boucher, a feminist-Buddhist teacher, interviewed over one hundred Buddhist women. She determined from their experiences and her own that American Buddhism has ""the possibility for the creation of a religion fully inclusive of women's realities, in which women hold both institutional and spiritual leadership.""
In recent years, there is a strong presence of women in American Buddhism, and a number of women are even in leadership roles. This also may be due to the fact that American Buddhism tends to stress democratization over the traditional hierarchical structure of Buddhism in Asia. One study of Theravada Buddhist centers in the U.S., however, found that although men and women thought that Buddhist teachings were gender-blind, there were still distinct gender roles in the organization, including more male guest teachers and more women volunteering as cooks and cleaners.
In 1936, Sunya Gladys Pratt was ordained as a Buddhist minister in the Shin tradition in the Tacoma, Washington.
In 1976, Karuna Dharma became the first fully ordained female member of the Buddhist monastic community in the U.S.
In 1981, Ani Pema Chodron, an American woman, was ordained as a bhikkhuni in a lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. Pema Chödrön was the first American woman to be ordained as a Buddhist nun in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition.
In 1988, Jetsunma Ahkon Lhamo, an American woman formerly called Catharine Burroughs, became the first Western woman to be named a reincarnate lama.
In 1998, Sherry Chayat became the first American woman to receive transmission in the Rinzai school of Buddhism.
In 2002, Khenmo Drolma, an American woman, became the first bhikkhuni in the Drikung Kagyu lineage of Buddhism, traveling to Taiwan to be ordained. In 2004 she became the first westerner of either sex to be installed as an abbot in the Drikung Kagyu lineage of Buddhism, being installed as the abbot of the Vajra Dakini Nunnery in Vermont (America's first Tibetan Buddhist nunnery) in 2004.
In 2003, Ayya Sudhamma Bhikkhuni became the first American-born woman to gain bhikkhuni ordination in the Theravada school in Sri Lanka.
In 2006, for the first time in American history, a Buddhist ordination was held where an American woman (Sister Khanti-Khema) took the Samaneri (novice) vows with an American monk (Bhante Vimalaramsi) presiding. This was done for the Buddhist American Forest Tradition at the Dhamma Sukha Meditation Center in Missouri. Also in 2006, Merle Kodo Boyd, born in Texas, became the first African-American woman ever to receive Dharma transmission in Zen Buddhism.
In 2010, the first Tibetan Buddhist nunnery in America (Vajra Dakini Nunnery in Vermont), offering novice ordination in the Drikung Kagyu lineage of Buddhism, was officially consecrated.
In 2022, Terri Omori is appointed the first female president of the 12,000 member strong Buddhist Churches of America.

Contemporary developments
Engaged Buddhism
Socially engaged Buddhism has developed in Buddhism in the West. While some critics assert the term is redundant, as it is mistaken to believe that Buddhism in the past has not affected and been affected by the surrounding society, others have suggested that Buddhism is sometimes seen as too passive toward public life. This is particularly true in the West, where almost all converts to Buddhism come to it outside of an existing family or community tradition. Engaged Buddhism is an attempt to apply Buddhist values to larger social problems, including war and environmental concerns. The term was coined by Thích Nhất Hạnh, during his years as a peace activist in Vietnam. 
The Buddhist Peace Fellowship was founded in 1978 by Robert Aitken, Anne Aitken, Nelson Foster, and others and received early assistance from Gary Snyder, Jack Kornfield, and Joanna Macy. 
Another engaged Buddhist group is the Zen Peacemaker Order, founded in 1996 by Bernie Glassman and Sandra Jishu Holmes.
In 2007, the American Buddhist scholar-monk, Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi, was invited to write an editorial essay for the Buddhist magazine Buddhadharma. In his essay, he called attention to the narrowly inward focus of American Buddhism, which has been pursued to the neglect of the active dimension of Buddhist compassion expressed through programs of social engagement. Several of Ven. Bodhi's students who read the essay felt a desire to follow up on his suggestions. After a few rounds of discussions, they resolved to form a Buddhist relief organization dedicated to alleviating the suffering of the poor and disadvantaged in the developing world. At the initial meetings, seeking a point of focus, they decided to direct their relief efforts at the problem of global hunger, especially by supporting local efforts by those in developing countries to achieve self-sufficiency through improved food productivity. Contacts were made with leaders and members of other Buddhist communities in the greater New York area, and before long Buddhist Global Relief emerged as an inter-denominational organization comprising people of different Buddhist groups who share the vision of a Buddhism actively committed to the task of alleviating social and economic suffering.

Misconduct
A number of groups and individuals have been implicated in scandals. Sandra Bell has analysed the scandals at Vajradhatu and the San Francisco Zen Center and concluded that these kinds of scandals are most likely to occur in organisations that are in transition between the pure forms of charismatic authority that brought them into being and more rational, corporate forms of organization"". She also highlights the student-teacher dynamic and the significance of a spiritual leader in the West, where lay Buddhist are likely focused on practices such as meditation. This teacher must know the student to guide them through difficulties, and the student must be trusting and open with the teacher, this can be a powerful opportunity but also opens the door to potential issues. 
Ford states that no one can express the ""hurt and dismay"" these events brought to each center, and that the centers have in a number of cases emerged stronger because they no longer depend on a ""single charismatic leader"".
Robert Sharf also mentions charisma from which institutional power is derived, and the need to balance charismatic authority with institutional authority. Elaborate analyses of these scandals are made by Stuart Lachs, who mentions the uncritical acceptance of religious narratives, such as lineages and dharma transmission, which aid in giving uncritical charismatic powers to teachers and leaders.
Following is a partial list from reliable sources, limited to the United States and by no means all-inclusive. 

In 1983, the San Francisco Zen Center experienced a sex scandal resulting in the resignation of abbot Richard Baker.
Taizan Maezumi slept with several of his students at the Zen Center of Los Angeles and he died of alcoholism.
In 1988, Seung Sahn had sexual affairs with several of his students in the Kwan Um School of Zen.
Tibetan Buddhist teacher Chögyam Trungpa openly had sexual relationships with numbers of female members of his sangha, and died of health complications from his quite public alcoholism.
Trungpa's Dharma heir Ösel Tendzin contracted and later died from complications of the AIDS virus. Knowing himself to be infected, Tendzin had unprotected sex with at least two of his male students. One of them later died of AIDS.
In 2010, Shasta Abbey abbot and successor to Houn Jiyu-Kennett Eko Little resigned and subsequently disrobed after admitting to forming a sexual relationship with one of the members of the lay congregation.
In 2010, Eido Tai Shimano retired from the Zen Studies Society after admitting to sexual liaisons.
In 2011 because of sexual misconduct, Dennis Merzel said he would disrobe as a Buddhist priest and resign as an elder of the White Plum Asanga.
Several women have accused Joshu Sasaki of making sexual advances over the course of decades, and scandal struck the Cimarron Zen Center in Los Angeles.

Accreditation
Definitions and policies may differ greatly between different schools or sects: for example, ""many, perhaps most"" Soto priests ""see no distinction between ordination and Dharma transmission"". Disagreement and misunderstanding exist on this point, among lay practitioners and Zen teachers alike.
James Ford writes,

[S]urprising numbers of people use the titles Zen teacher, master, roshi and sensei without any obvious connections to Zen [...] Often they obfuscate their Zen connections, raising the very real question whether they have any authentic relationship to the Zen world at all. In my studies I've run across literally dozens of such cases.
James Ford claims that about eighty percent of authentic teachers in the United States belong to the American Zen Teachers Association or the Soto Zen Buddhist Association and are listed on their websites. This can help a prospective student sort out who is a ""normative stream"" teacher from someone who is perhaps not, but of course twenty percent do not participate.

Demographics of Buddhism in the United States
Numbers of Buddhists
Accurate counts of Buddhists in the United States are difficult. Self-description has pitfalls. Because Buddhism is a cultural concept, individuals who self-describe as Buddhists may have little knowledge or commitment to Buddhism as a religion or practice; on the other hand, others may be deeply involved in meditation and committed to the Dharma, but may refuse the label ""Buddhist"". In the 1990s, Robert A. F. Thurman estimated there were 5 to 6 million Buddhists in America.
In a 2007 Pew Research Center survey, at 0.7% Buddhism was the third largest religion in the US after Christianity (78.4%), no religion (10.3%) and Judaism (1.7%). In 2012 on the occasion of a visit from the Dalai Lama, U-T San Diego said there are 1.2 million Buddhist practitioners in the U.S., and of them 40% live in Southern California.
In 2008 the ""Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life Religious Landscape Survey"" estimated American Buddhists at 0.7% of the American population. During the same year the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS), estimated this same figure at 0.5%. ARIS estimated that the number of adherents rose by 170% between 1990 and 2000, reaching 1.2 million followers in 2008. According to William Wilson Quinn ""by all indications that remarkable rate of growth continues unabated."" But according to Robert Thurman, 

Scholars are unsure whether the reports are accurate, as Americans who might dabble in various forms of Buddhism may not identify themselves as Buddhist on a survey. That makes it difficult to quantify the number of Buddhists in the United States.
Others argued, in 2012, that Buddhists made up 1 percent of the American population (about three million people).  By the year 2050 Buddhism is projected to become the third largest major religious group in North America, after Christianity and Islam.

Demographics of Buddhist Converts
A sociological survey conducted in 1999 found that relative to the US population as a whole, Buddhist converts are proportionately more likely to be white, upper middle class, highly educated, and left-leaning in their political views. In terms of race, only 10% of survey respondents indicated they were a race other than white, a matter that has been cause of some concern among Buddhist leaders. Nearly a third of the respondents were college graduates, and more than half held advanced degrees. Politically, 60% identified themselves as Democrats, and Green Party affiliations outnumbered Republicans by 3 to 1. Buddhist converts were also proportionately more likely to have come from Catholic, and especially Jewish backgrounds. More than half of these adherents came to Buddhism through reading books on the topic, with the rest coming by way of martial arts and friends or acquaintances. The average age of the respondents was 46. Daily meditation was their most commonly cited Buddhist practice, with most meditating 30 minutes a day or more.   
In 2015 a Pew Foundation survey found 67% of American Buddhists were raised in a religion other than Buddhism. 61% said their spouse has a religion other than Buddhism. It also showed that one-third of Buddhists in America are of Asian descent, while the remaining three-fourths are converts to Buddhism. The survey was conducted only in English and Spanish, and may under-estimate Buddhist immigrants who speak Asian languages. A 2012 Pew study found Buddhism is practiced by 15% of surveyed Chinese Americans, 6% of Koreans, 25% of Japanese, 43% of Vietnamese and 1% of Filipinos.

Ethnic divide
Although the 2008 Pew Landscape Study suggested white Americans made up the majority of Buddhists in the United States, subsequent research has refuted this conclusion, first on the study's small data set, second on significant methodological errors, and third on subsequent research published by Pew in the 2012 survey of religious life of Asian Americans. Based on this latter study's data, Asian American Buddhists make up approximately 67–69% of all Buddhists in the United States.
Discussion about Buddhism in America has sometimes focused on the issue of the visible ethnic divide separating ethnic Buddhist congregations from import Buddhist groups. Although multiple Zen and Tibetan Buddhist temples were founded by Asians, they now attract fewer Asian-Americans. With the exception of Sōka Gakkai, almost all active Buddhist groups in America are either ethnic or import Buddhism based on the demographics of their membership. There is often limited contact between Buddhists of different ethnic groups.
However, the cultural divide should not necessarily be seen as pernicious. It is often argued that the differences between Buddhist groups arise benignly from the differing needs and interests of those involved. Convert Buddhists tend to be interested in meditation and philosophy, in some cases eschewing the trappings of religiosity altogether. On the other hand, for immigrants and their descendants, preserving tradition and maintaining a social framework assume a much greater relative importance, making their approach to religion naturally more conservative. Further, based on a survey of Asian-American Buddhists in San Francisco, ""many Asian-American Buddhists view non-Asian Buddhism as still in a formative, experimental stage"" and yet they believe that it ""could eventually mature into a religious expression of exceptional quality"".
Additional questions come from the demographics within import Buddhism. The majority of American converts practicing at Buddhist centers are white, often from Christian or Jewish backgrounds. Only Sōka Gakkai has attracted significant numbers of African-American or Latino members. A variety of ideas have been broached regarding the nature, causes, and significance of this racial uniformity. Journalist Clark Strand noted

…that it has tried to recruit [African-Americans] at all makes Sōka Gakkai International utterly unique in American Buddhism.
Strand, writing for Tricycle (an American Buddhist journal) in 2004, notes that SGI has specifically targeted African-Americans, Latinos and Asians, and other writers have noted that this approach has begun to spread, with Vipassana and Theravada retreats aimed at non-white practitioners led by a handful of specific teachers.
A question is the degree of importance ascribed to discrimination, which is suggested to be mostly unconscious, on the part of white converts toward potential minority converts. To some extent, the racial divide indicates a class divide, because convert Buddhists tend to be more educated. Among African American Buddhists who commented on the dynamics of the racial divide in convert Buddhism are Jan Willis and Charles R. Johnson.
A Pew study shows that Americans tend to be less biased towards Buddhists when compared to other religions, such as Christianity, to which 18% of people were biased, when only 14% were biased towards Buddhists. American Buddhists are often not raised as Buddhists, with 32% of American Buddhists being raised Protestant, and 22% being raised Catholic, which means that over half of the American Buddhists were converted at some point in time. Also, Buddhism has had to adapt to America in order to garner more followers so that the concept would not seem so foreign, so they adopted ""Catholic"" words such as ""worship"" and ""churches"".

Buddhist education in the United States
Chögyam Trungpa founded Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado, a four-year Buddhist college in the US (now Naropa University) in 1974. Allen Ginsberg was an initial faculty member, christening the institute's poetry department the ""Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics"". Now Naropa University, the school offers accredited degrees in a number of subjects, many not directly related to Buddhism.
The University of the West is affiliated with Hsi Lai Temple and was previously Hsi Lai University. Soka University of America, in Aliso Viejo California, was founded by the Sōka Gakkai as a secular school committed to philosophic Buddhism. The City of Ten Thousand Buddhas is the site of Dharma Realm Buddhist University, a four-year college teaching courses primarily related to Buddhism but including some general-interest subjects. The Institute of Buddhist Studies in Berkeley, California, in addition to offering a master's degree in Buddhist Studies acts as the ministerial training arm of the Buddhist Churches of America and is affiliated with the Graduate Theological Union. The school moved into the Jodo Shinshu Center in Berkeley.
The first Buddhist high school in the United States, Developing Virtue Secondary School, was founded in 1981 by the Dharma Realm Buddhist Association at their branch monastery in the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas in Ukiah, California. In 1997, the Purple Lotus Buddhist School offered elementary-level classes in Union City, California, affiliated with the True Buddha School; it added a middle school in 1999 and a high school in 2001. Another Buddhist high school, Tinicum Art and Science now The Lotus School of Liberal Arts, which combines Zen practice and traditional liberal arts, opened in Ottsville, Pennsylvania, in 1998. It is associated informally with the World Shim Gum Do Association in Boston. The Pacific Buddhist Academy opened in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 2003. It shares a campus with the Hongwanji Mission School, an elementary and middle school; both schools affiliated with the Honpa Hongwanji Jodo Shinshu mission.
Juniper Foundation, founded in 2003, holds that Buddhist methods must become integrated into modern culture just as they were in other cultures. Juniper Foundation calls its approach ""Buddhist training for modern life"" and it emphasizes meditation, balancing emotions, cultivating compassion and developing insight as four building blocks of Buddhist training.

Statistics
U.S. states by Buddhist population
Hawaii has the largest Buddhist population by percentage, amounting to 8% of the state's population. California follows Hawaii with 2%. Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wyoming have a Buddhist population of 1%.
The Buddhist population rapidly increased in the 1960s with the change in Asian immigration law to the United States. By the 1980's, multiple Buddhist communities began to sprout throughout the country.

Buddhism in American Overseas territories
The following is the percentage of Buddhists in the U.S. territories as of 2010:

Types of Buddhism in the United States
Three broad types of American Buddhism are found in the United States:

The oldest and largest of these is ""immigrant"" or ""ethnic Buddhism"", those Buddhist traditions that came to America with immigrants who were already practitioners and that largely remained with those immigrants and their descendants.
The next oldest and arguably the most visible group Prebish refers to as ""import Buddhists"", because they came to America largely in response to interested American converts who sought them out, either by going abroad or by supporting foreign teachers; this is sometimes also called ""elite Buddhism"" because its practitioners, especially early ones, tended to come from social elites.
A trend in Buddhism is ""export"" or ""evangelical Buddhist"" groups based in another country who actively recruit members in the US from various backgrounds. Modern Buddhism is not just an American phenomenon.
This typology has been the subject of debate among scholars who have noted the problematic nature of equating ""ethnic"" Buddhists with Asian immigrants which elides the ethnicity or cultural specificity of white American Buddhists.

Immigrant Buddhism
Buddhism was introduced into the US by Asian immigrants in the 19th century, when significant numbers of immigrants from East Asia began to arrive in the New World. In the United States, immigrants from China entered around 1820, but began to arrive in large numbers following the 1849 California Gold Rush.
Immigrant Buddhist congregations in North America are as diverse as the different peoples of Asian Buddhist extraction who settled there. The US is home to Sri Lankan Buddhists, Chinese Buddhists, Japanese Buddhists, Korean Buddhists, Thai Buddhists, Cambodian Buddhists, Vietnamese Buddhists and Buddhists with family backgrounds in most Buddhist countries and regions. The Immigration Act of 1965 increased the number of immigrants arriving from China, Vietnam and the Theravada-practicing countries of Southeast Asia.

Chinese immigration
The first Buddhist temple in America was built in 1853 in San Francisco by the Sze Yap Company, a Chinese American fraternal society. Another society, the Ning Yeong Company, built a second in 1854; by 1875, there were eight temples, and by 1900 approximately 400 Chinese temples on the west coast of the United States, most of them containing some Buddhist elements. Unfortunately a casualty of racism, these temples were often the subject of suspicion and ignorance by the rest of the population, and were dismissively called joss houses.

Japanese and Korean immigration
The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 curtailed growth of the Chinese American population, but large-scale immigration from Japan began in the late 1880s and from Korea around 1903. In both cases, immigration was at first primarily to Hawai‘i. Populations from other Asian Buddhist countries followed, and in each case, the new communities established Buddhist temples and organizations. For instance, the first sanctioned Japanese temple in Hawai‘i, the Hāmākua Bukkyo Kaido (later renamed as the Hāmākua Jodo Mission), was built in 1896 by the Jōdo-shū school under the guidance of Reverend Gakuo Okabe. In 1898, Japanese missionaries and immigrants established a Young Men's Buddhist Association, and the Rev. Sōryū Kagahi was dispatched from Japan to be the first Buddhist missionary to Hawai‘i. The first Japanese Buddhist temple in the continental U.S. was built in San Francisco in 1899, and the first in Canada was built at the Ishikawa Hotel in Vancouver in 1905. The first Buddhist clergy to take up residence in the continental U.S. were Shuye Sonoda and Kakuryo Nishimjima, missionaries from Japan who arrived in 1899.

Contemporary Immigrant Buddhism
Japanese Buddhism
Buddhist Churches of America
The Buddhist Churches of America and the Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawaii are immigrant Buddhist organizations in the United States. The BCA is an affiliate of Japan's Nishi Hongwanji, a sect of Jōdo Shinshū, which is, in turn, a form of Pure Land Buddhism. Tracing its roots to the Young Men's Buddhist Association founded in San Francisco at the end of the 19th century and the Buddhist Mission of North America founded in 1899, it took its current form in 1944. All of the Buddhist Mission's leadership, along with almost the entire Japanese American population, had been interned during World War II. The name Buddhist Churches of America was adopted at Topaz War Relocation Center in Utah; the word ""church"" was used in analogy to a Christian house of worship. After internment ended, some members returned to the West Coast and revitalized churches there, while a number of others moved to the Midwest and built new churches. During the 1960s and 1970s, the BCA was in a growth phase and was very successful at fund-raising. It also published two periodicals, one in Japanese and one in English. However, since 1980, BCA membership declined. The 36 temples in the state of Hawaii of the Honpa Hongwanji Mission have a similar history. 
While a majority of the Buddhist Churches of America's membership are ethnically Japanese, some members have non-Asian backgrounds. Thus, it has limited aspects of export Buddhism. As involvement by its ethnic community declined, internal discussions advocated attracting the broader public.

Nichiren buddhism
Soka Gakkai, which means ""Value Creation Society"", is one of three sects of Nichiren Buddhism. It is considered a new religious movement from Japan that expanded after World War II. Soka Gakkai came to the United States with Daisaku Ikeda in the mid-20th century. Because of a rift with Nichiren Shōshū in 1991, the SGI has no priests of its own. Its main religious practice is chanting the mantra Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō and sections of the Lotus Sutra. Unlike schools such as Zen, Vipassanā, and Tibetan Buddhism, Soka Gakkai Buddhists do not practice meditative techniques other than chanting.

Taiwanese Buddhism
Another US Buddhist institution is Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California. Hsi Lai is the American headquarters of Fo Guang Shan, a modern Buddhist group in Taiwan. Hsi Lai was built in 1988 at a cost of $10 million and is often described as the largest Buddhist temple in the Western hemisphere. Although it caters primarily to Chinese Americans, it also has regular services and outreach programs in English.

Growth of Buddhist philosophy in America
While Asian immigrants were arriving, some American intellectuals examined Buddhism, based primarily on information from British colonies in India and East Asia.
In the last century, numbers of Asian Buddhist masters and teachers have immigrated to the U.S. in order to propagate their beliefs and practices. Most have belonged to three major Buddhist traditions or cultures: Zen, Tibetan, and Theravadan.

Early translations
The Englishmen William Jones and Charles Wilkins translated Sanskrit texts into English. The American Transcendentalists Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Walt Whitman, took an interest in Hindu and Buddhist philosophy. They were among the first western writers to have access to translated Hindu and Buddhist texts. In 1844, The Dial, a small literary publication edited by Thoreau and Emerson, published an English version of a portion of the Lotus Sutra; it had been translated by Dial business manager Elizabeth Palmer Peabody from a French version recently completed by Eugène Burnouf. His Indian readings may have influenced his later experiments in simple living: at one point in Walden Thoreau wrote: ""I realized what the Orientals meant by contemplation and the forsaking of works."" Poet Walt Whitman also references Indian religions in his writing. In Whitman's well-known poem ""Passage to India"", he refers to Indian rivers, history and theology.

Theosophical Society
An early American to publicly convert to Buddhism was Henry Steel Olcott. Olcott, a former U.S. army colonel during the Civil War, had grown interested in reports of supernatural phenomena that were popular in the late 19th century. In 1875, he, Helena Blavatsky, and William Quan Judge founded the Theosophical Society, dedicated to the study of the occult and influenced by Hindu and Buddhist scriptures. The leaders claimed to believe that they were in contact, via visions and messages, with a secret order of adepts called the ""Himalayan Brotherhood"" or ""the Masters"". In 1879, Olcott and Blavatsky traveled to India and in 1880, to Sri Lanka, where they were met enthusiastically by local Buddhists, who saw them as allies against an aggressive Christian missionary movement. On May 25, Olcott and Blavatsky took the pancasila vows of a lay Buddhist before a monk and a large crowd. Although most of the Theosophists appear to have counted themselves as Buddhists, they held idiosyncratic beliefs that separated them from known Buddhist traditions; only Olcott was enthusiastic about following mainstream Buddhism. He returned twice to Sri Lanka, where he promoted Buddhist education, and visited Japan and Burma. Olcott authored a Buddhist Catechism, stating his view of the basic tenets of the religion.
Several publications increased knowledge of Buddhism in 19th-century America. In 1879, Edwin Arnold, an English aristocrat, published The Light of Asia, an epic poem he had written about the life and teachings of the Buddha, expounded with much wealth of local color and not a little felicity of versification. The book became immensely popular in the United States, going through eighty editions and selling more than 500,000 copies.

Paul Carus
Paul Carus, a German American philosopher and theologian, was at work on a more scholarly prose treatment of the same subject. Carus was the director of Open Court Publishing Company, an academic publisher specializing in philosophy, science, and religion, and editor of The Monist, a journal with a similar focus, both based in La Salle, Illinois. In 1894, Carus published The Gospel of Buddha, compiled from a variety of Asian texts which, true to its name, presented the Buddha's story in a form resembling the Christian Gospels. Carus was acclaimed among Asian clerics for his understanding of Buddhism. In a letter to S. Sonoda in San Francisco, Carus wrote ""breathe the true spirit of Buddhism and yet be adapted to Western ways of thought"".

Early spread
In 1887, The Buddhist Ray appeared, a Santa Cruz, California-based magazine published and edited by Phillangi Dasa, born Herman Carl (or Carl Herman) Veetering (or Vettering), a recluse about whom little is known. The Ray's tone was ""ironic, light, saucy, self-assured ... one-hundred-percent American Buddhist"". It ceased publication in 1894. 
In 1893, the Parliament of the World's Religions hosted a number of Buddhist delegates, including the Zen master Soyen Shaku and the Sri Lankan Buddhist revivalist Anagarika Dharmapala. Shaku contrasted the idea of karma as a principle of causality with the ""Prime Mover"" nature of the Christian God, while Dharmapala challenged the idea of Christianity as a ""universal religion"" by comparing it to the more ancient and ""universal"" teachings of the Buddha.
In 1900 six white San Franciscans, working with Japanese Jodo Shinshu missionaries, established the Dharma Sangha of Buddha and published a bimonthly magazine, The Light of Dharma. In Illinois, Paul Carus wrote more books about Buddhism and set portions of Buddhist scripture to Western classical music.
By 1970, most all sects of Asian Buddhism were present in America. Don Morreale's 1988 catalogue of Buddhist America: Centers, Retreats, Practices had 350 pages of listings.

Dwight Goddard
One American who attempted to establish an American Buddhist movement was Dwight Goddard (1861–1939). Goddard was a Christian missionary to China when he first came in contact with Buddhism. In 1928, he spent a year living at a Zen monastery in Japan. In 1934, he founded ""The Followers of Buddha, an American Brotherhood"", with the goal of applying the traditional monastic structure of Buddhism more strictly than Senzaki and Sokei-an. The group was largely unsuccessful: no Americans were recruited to join as monks and attempts failed to attract a Chinese Chan (Zen) master to come to the United States. However, Goddard's efforts as an author and publisher bore considerable fruit. In 1930, he began publishing ZEN: A Buddhist Magazine. In 1932, he collaborated with D. T. Suzuki on a translation of the Lankavatara Sutra. That same year, he published the first edition of A Buddhist Bible, an anthology of Buddhist scriptures focusing on those used in Chinese and Japanese Zen.

Zen
Japanese Rinzai
Zen was introduced to the United States by Japanese priests who were sent to serve local immigrant groups. A small group also came to study the American culture and way of life.

Early Rinzai-teachers
In 1893, Soyen Shaku was invited to speak at the Parliament of the World's Religions held in Chicago. During his talks, Shaku he challenged his mostly Christian audience's notions of religion and presented Zen Buddhism as rational, nontheistic, and compatible with modern science. In 1905, Shaku was invited to stay in the United States by a wealthy American couple. He lived for nine months near San Francisco, where he established a small zendo in the home of Alexander and Ida Russell and gave regular zazen lessons, making him the first Zen Buddhist priest to teach in North America.
Shaku was followed by Nyogen Senzaki, a young monk from Shaku's home temple in Japan. Senzaki briefly worked for the Russells and then as a hotel porter, manager and eventually, owner. In 1922 Senzaki rented a hall and gave an English talk on a paper by Shaku; his periodic talks at different locations became known as the ""floating zendo"". Senzaki established an itinerant sitting hall from San Francisco to Los Angeles in California, where he taught until his death in 1958.
Sokatsu Shaku, one of Shaku's senior students, arrived in late 1906, founding a Zen meditation center called Ryomokyo-kai. One of his disciples, Shigetsu Sasaki, better known under his monastic name Sokei-an, came to New York to teach. In 1931, his small group incorporated as the Buddhist Society of America, later renamed the First Zen Institute of America. By the late 1930s, one of his most active supporters was Ruth Fuller Everett, an American socialite and the mother-in-law of Alan Watts. Shortly before Sokei-an's death in 1945, he and Everett would wed, at which point she took the name Ruth Fuller Sasaki.

D.T. Suzuki
D.T. Suzuki had a great literary impact. Through English language essays and books, such as Essays in Zen Buddhism (1927), he became a visible expositor of Zen Buddhism and its unofficial ambassador to Western readers. In 1951, Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki returned to the United States to take a visiting professorship at Columbia University, where his open lectures attracted members of the literary, artistic, and cultural elite.

Beat Zen
In the mid-1950s, writers associated with the Beat Generation took a serious interest in Zen, including Gary Snyder, Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and Kenneth Rexroth, which increased its visibility. Prior to that, Philip Whalen had interest as early as 1946, and D. T. Suzuki began lecturing on Buddhism at Columbia in 1950. By 1958, anticipating Kerouac's publication of The Dharma Bums by three months, Time magazine said, ""Zen Buddhism is growing more chic by the minute.""

Contemporary Rinzai
Contemporary Rinzai Zen teachers in United States have included Kyozan Joshu Sasaki Roshi, Eido Tai Shimano Roshi, and Omori Sogen Roshi (d. 1994). Sasaki founded the Mount Baldy Zen Center and its branches after coming to Los Angeles from Japan in 1962. One of his students is the Canadian poet and musician Leonard Cohen. Eido Roshi founded Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-ji, a training center in New York state. Omori Roshi founded Daihonzan Chozen-ji, the first Rinzai headquarters temple established outside Japan, in Honolulu; under his students Tenshin Tanouye Roshi and Dogen Hosokawa Roshi and their dharma heirs, several other training centers were established including Daiyuzenji in Chicago and Korinji in Wisconsin.
In 1998 Sherry Chayat, born in Brooklyn, became the first American woman to receive transmission in the Rinzai school of Buddhism.

Japanese Sōtō
Soyu Matsuoka
In the 1930s Soyu Matsuoka-roshi was sent to America by Sōtōshū, to establish the Sōtō Zen tradition in the United States. He established the Chicago Buddhist Temple in 1949. Matsuoka-roshi also served as superintendent and abbot of the Long Beach Zen Buddhist Temple and Zen Center. He relocated from Chicago to establish a temple at Long Beach in 1971 after leaving the Zen Buddhist Temple of Chicago to his dharma heir Kongo Richard Langlois, Roshi. He returned to Chicago in 1995, where he died in 1998.

Shunryu Suzuki
Sōtō Zen priest Shunryu Suzuki (no relation to D.T. Suzuki), who was the son of a Sōtō priest, was sent to San Francisco in the late 1950s on a three-year temporary assignment to care for an established Japanese congregation at the Sōtō temple, Soko-ji. Suzuki also taught zazen or sitting meditation which soon attracted American students and ""beatniks"", who formed a core of students who in 1962 would create the San Francisco Zen Center and its eventual network of highly influential Zen centers across the country, including the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, the first Buddhist monastery in the Western world. He provided innovation and creativity during San Francisco's countercultural movement of the 1960s but he died in 1971. His low-key teaching style was described in the popular book Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind, a compilation of his talks.

Tozen Akiyama
Ordained in 1974 in Japan by Tosui Ohta, came to the United States in 1983, initially posted to Zenshuji in Los Angeles. In 1985 he became the abbot of Milwaukee Zen Center, which he led and developed until 2000. He has three dharma heirs: Jisho Warner in California, abiding teacher of Stone Creek Zen Center; Tonen Sara O'Connor in Wisconsin, former head priest of Milwaukee Zen Center; and Toshu Neatrour in Idaho.

White Plum Sangha
Taizan Maezumi arrived as a young priest to serve at Zenshuji, the North American Sōtō sect headquarters in Los Angeles, in 1956. Maezumi received dharma transmission (shiho) from Baian Hakujun Kuroda, his father and high-ranked Sōtō priest, in 1955. By the mid-1960s he had formed a regular zazen group. In 1967, he and his supporters founded the Zen Center of Los Angeles. Further, he received teaching permission (inka) from Koryu Osaka – a Rinzai teacher – and from Yasutani Hakuun of the Sanbo Kyodan. Maezumi, in turn, had several American dharma heirs, such as Bernie Glassman, John Daido Loori, Charlotte Joko Beck, William Nyogen Yeo, and Dennis Genpo Merzel. His successors and their network of centers became the White Plum Sangha. In 2006 Merle Kodo Boyd, born in Texas, became the first African-American woman ever to receive Dharma transmission in Zen Buddhism.

Sanbo Kyodan
Sanbo Kyodan is a contemporary Japanese Zen lineage which had an impact in the West disproportionate to its size in Japan. It is rooted in the reformist teachings of Harada Daiun Sogaku (1871–1961) and his disciple Yasutani Hakuun (1885–1971), who argued that the existing Zen institutions of Japan (Sōtō and Rinzai sects) had become complacent and were generally unable to convey real Dharma.

Philip Kapleau
Sanbo Kyodan's first American member was Philip Kapleau, who first traveled to Japan in 1945 as a court reporter for the war crimes trials. In 1953, he returned to Japan, where he met with Nakagawa Soen, a protégé of Nyogen Senzaki. In 1965, he published a book, The Three Pillars of Zen, which recorded a set of talks by Yasutani outlining his approach to practice, along with transcripts of dokusan interviews and some additional texts. In 1965 Kapleau returned to America and, in 1966, established the Rochester Zen Center in Rochester, New York. In 1967, Kapleau had a falling-out with Yasutani over Kapleau's moves to Americanize his temple, after which it became independent of Sanbo Kyodan. One of Kapleau's early disciples was Toni Packer, who left Rochester in 1981 to found a nonsectarian meditation center, not specifically Buddhist or Zen.

Robert Aitken
Robert Aitken was introduced to Zen as a prisoner in Japan during World War II. After returning to the United States, he studied with Nyogen Senzaki in Los Angeles in the early 1950s. In 1959, while still a Zen student, he founded the Diamond Sangha, a zendo in Honolulu, Hawaii. Aitken became a dharma heir of Yamada's, authored more than ten books, and developed the Diamond Sangha into an international network with temples in the United States, Argentina, Germany, and Australia. In 1995, he and his organization split with Sanbo Kyodan in response to reorganization of the latter following Yamada's death. The Pacific Zen Institute led by John Tarrant, Aitken's first Dharma successor, continues as an independent Zen line.

Chinese Chán
There are also Zen teachers of Chinese Chán, Korean Seon, and Vietnamese Thien.

Hsuan Hua
In 1962, Hsuan Hua moved to San Francisco's Chinatown, where, in addition to Zen, he taught Chinese Pure Land, Tiantai, Vinaya, and Vajrayana Buddhism. Initially, his students were mostly westerners, but he eventually attracted a range of followers.

Sheng-yen
Sheng-yen first visited the United States in 1978 under the sponsorship of the Buddhist Association of the United States, an organization of Chinese American Buddhists. In 1980, he founded the Chán Meditation Society in Queens, New York. In 1985, he founded the Chung-hwa Institute of Buddhist Studies in Taiwan, which sponsors Chinese Zen activities in the United States.

Korean Seon
Seung Sahn was a temple abbot in Seoul. After living in Hong Kong and Japan, he moved to the US in 1972 (not speaking any English) to establish the Kwan Um School of Zen. Shortly after arriving in Providence, he attracted students and founded the Providence Zen Center. The Kwan Um School has more than 100 Zen centers on six continents.
Another Korean Zen teacher, Samu Sunim, founded Toronto's Zen Buddhist Temple in 1971. He was head of the Buddhist Society for Compassionate Wisdom, which has temples in Ann Arbor, Chicago, Toronto, Mexico City, and New York City, along with a retreat center in Upstate New York. 
Hye Am (1884–1985) brought lineage Dharma to the United States. Hye Am's Dharma successor, Myo Vong founded the Western Son Academy (1976), and his Korean disciple, Pohwa Sunim, founded World Zen Fellowship (1994) which includes various Zen centers in the United States, such as the Potomac Zen Sangha, the Patriarchal Zen Society and the Baltimore Zen Center.
Recently, Korean Buddhist monks have come to the United States to spread the Dharma. They are establishing temples and zen (Korean, 'Seon') centers all around the United States. For example, Hyeonho established the Goryosah Temple in Los Angeles in 1979, and Muil Woohak founded the Budzen Center in New York.

Vietnamese Thien
Vietnamese Zen (Thiền) teachers in America include Thích Thiên-Ân and Thích Nhất Hạnh. Thích Thiên-Ân came to America in 1966 as a visiting professor at UCLA and taught traditional Thiền meditation.

Thích Nhất Hạnh
Thích Nhất Hạnh was a monk in Vietnam during the Vietnam War. In 1966, he left Vietnam in exile and founded the Plum Village Monastery in France. In his books and talks, Thích Nhất Hạnh emphasizes mindfulness (sati) as the most important practice in daily life. His monastic students live and practice at three centers in the United States: Deer Park Monastery in Escondido, California, Blue Cliff Monastery in Pine Bush, New York, and Magnolia Grove Monastery in Batesville, Mississippi.

Tibetan Buddhism
Perhaps the most widely visible Buddhist leader in the world is Tenzin Gyatso, the current Dalai Lama, who first visited the United States in 1979. As the exiled political leader of Tibet, he has become a popular cause célèbre, attracting celebrity religious followers such as Richard Gere and Adam Yauch. His early life was depicted in Hollywood films such as Kundun and Seven Years in Tibet. An early Western-born Tibetan Buddhist monk was Robert A. F. Thurman, now an academic supporter of the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama maintains a North American headquarters in Ithaca, New York.
The Dalai Lama's family has strong ties to America. His brother Thubten Norbu fled China after being asked to assassinate his brother. He was himself a Lama, the Takster Rinpoche, and an abbot of the Kumbum Monastery in Tibet's Amdo region. He settled in Bloomington, Indiana, where he later founded the Tibetan Mongolian Buddhist Cultural Center and Kumbum Chamtse Ling Temple. Since the death of the Takster Rinpoche it has served as a Kumbum of the West, with the current Arija Rinpochere serving as its leader.
Dilowa Gegen (Diluu Khudagt) was the first lama to immigrate to the United States in 1949 as a political refugee and joined Owen Lattimore's Mongolia Project. He was born in Tudevtei, Zavkhan, Mongolia and was one of the leading figures in declaration of independence of Mongolia. He was exiled from Mongolia, the reason remains unrevealed to this day. After arriving in the US, he joined Johns Hopkins University and founded a monastery in New Jersey.

The first Tibetan Buddhist lama to have American students was Geshe Ngawang Wangyal, a Kalmyk-Mongolian of the Gelug lineage, who came to the United States in 1955 and founded the ""Lamaist Buddhist Monastery of America"" in New Jersey in 1958. Among his students were the future western scholars Robert Thurman, Jeffrey Hopkins, Alexander Berzin and Anne C. Klein. Other early arrivals included Dezhung Rinpoche, a Sakya lama who settled in Seattle, in 1960, and Tarthang Tulku Rinpoche, the first Nyingma teacher in America, who arrived in the US in 1968 and established the ""Tibetan Nyingma Meditation Center"" in Berkeley, California, in 1969.
A well known Tibetan Buddhist lama to live in the United States was Chögyam Trungpa. Trungpa, part of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism, moved to England in 1963, founded a temple in Scotland, and then relocated to Barnet, Vermont, and then Boulder, Colorado, by 1970. He established what he named Dharmadhatu meditation centers, eventually organized under a national umbrella group called Vajradhatu (renamed Shambhala International in February 2000). He developed a series of secular techniques he called Shambhala Training. Following Trungpa's death, his followers at the Rocky Mountain Shambhala Center built the Great Stupa of Dharmakaya, a traditional reliquary monument, near Red Feather Lakes, Colorado, consecrated in 2001.

There are four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism: the Gelug, the Kagyu, the Nyingma, and the Sakya. Of these, the greatest impact in the West was made by the Gelug, led by the Dalai Lama, and the Kagyu, specifically its Karma Kagyu branch, led by the Karmapa. In 1974 Trungpa Rinpoche and Kalu Rinpoche invited the 16th Karmapa to the united States. As of the early 1990s, there were several significant strands of Kagyu practice in the United States: Chögyam Trungpa's Shambhala movement; Karma Triyana Dharmachakra, a network of centers affiliated directly with the Karmapa's North American seat in Woodstock, New York; a network of centers founded by Kalu Rinpoche; a number of centers dedicated to mahamudra study and practice founded by Thrangu Rinpoche. The Drikung Kagyu lineage also has an established presence in the United States. Khenchen Konchog Gyaltsen arrived in the US in 1982 and planted the seeds for multiple Drikung centers across the country. He also paved the way for the arrival of Garchen Rinpoche, who established the Garchen Buddhist Institute in Chino Valley, Arizona. In 1990, Mahamudra Meditation Center was founded by Peter F. Barth, under the guidance of Thrangu Rinpoche and Khenchen Konchog Gyaltsen.
Diamond Way Buddhism founded by Lama Ole Nydahl and Hannah Nydahl, and under the spiritual guidance of Thaye Dorje, is also active in the US. The focus is on making Karma Kagyu teachings and methods available to modern and independent thinkers in the West. In 1972, the 16th Karmapa Rangjung Rigpe Dorje requested Lama Ole Nydhal and Hannah Nydhal to establish Buddhist centers of the Karma Kagyu lineage in the Western world. Lama Ole Nydahl offered Buddhist refuge to tens of thousands of people and founded 640 Buddhist centers around the world.
In the 21st century, the Nyingma lineage is increasingly represented in the West by both Western and Tibetan teachers. Lama Surya Das is a Western-born teacher carrying on the ""great rimé"", a non-sectarian form of Tibetan Buddhism. The late Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche founded centers in Seattle and Brazil. Gochen Tulku Sangak (sometimes spelled ""Sang-Ngag"") Rinpoche is the founder and spiritual director of the first Ewam International Center located in the US. He is also the spiritual director of the Namchak Foundation in Montana and a primary lineage holder of the Namchak lineage. Khandro Rinpoche is a female Tibetan teacher who has a presence in America. Jetsunma Ahkon Lhamo is the first Western woman to be enthroned as a Tulku, and established Nyingma Kunzang Palyul Choling centers in Sedona, Arizona, and Poolesville, Maryland.
The Gelug tradition is represented in America by the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition (FPMT), founded by Lama Thubten Yeshe and Lama Zopa. Gelugpa teacher Geshe Michael Roach, the first American to be awarded a Geshe degree, established centers in New York and at Diamond Mountain University in Arizona.
Sravasti Abbey is the first Tibetan Buddhist monastery for Western monks and nuns in the U.S., established in Washington State by Bhikshuni Thubten Chodron in 2003. It is situated on 300 acres of forest and meadows, 11 miles (18 km) outside of Newport, Washington, near the Idaho state line. It is open to visitors who want to learn about community life in a Tibetan Buddhist monastic setting. The name Sravasti Abbey was chosen by the Dalai Lama. Bhikshuni Thubten Chodron had suggested the name, as Sravasti was the place in India where the Buddha spent 25 rains retreats (varsa in Sanskrit and yarne in Tibetan), and communities of both nuns and monks had resided there. This seemed auspicious to ensure the Buddha's teachings would be abundantly available to both male and female monastics at the monastery.
Sravasti Abbey is notable because it is home to a growing group of fully ordained bhikshunis (Buddhist nuns) practicing in the Tibetan tradition. This is special because the tradition of full ordination for women was not transmitted from India to Tibet. Ordained women practicing in the Tibetan tradition usually hold a novice ordination. Venerable Thubten Chodron, while faithfully following the teachings of her Tibetan teachers, has arranged for her students to seek full ordination as bhikshunis in Taiwan.
In January 2014, the Abbey, which then had seven bhikshunis and three novices, formally began its first winter varsa (three-month monastic retreat), which lasted until April 13, 2014. As far as the Abbey knows, this was the first time a Western bhikshuni sangha practicing in the Tibetan tradition had done this ritual in the United States and in English. On April 19, 2014, the Abbey held its first kathina ceremony to mark the end of the varsa. Also in 2014 the Abbey held its first Pavarana rite at the end of the varsa.  In October 2015 the Annual Western Buddhist Monastic Gathering was held at the Abbey for the first time; it was the 21st such gathering.
In 2006, Geshe Thupten Dorjee, educated at Drepung Loseling Monastery, and poet Sidney Burris founded the Tibetan Cultural Institute of Arkansas, which began offering two weekly meditation courses and bringing monks and scholars to give lectures to the community at large. In 2008, the TEXT (Tibetans in Exile Today) Program at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville began an oral history project to help archive the stories of Tibetans currently living in exile in India. In June 2011, a month after the Dalai Lama visited, TCIA received a donation to build a retreat center and stupa near Crosses, Arkansas.
In 2010 the first Tibetan Buddhist nunnery in North America was established in Vermont, called Vajra Dakini Nunnery, offering novice ordination. The abbot of this nunnery is an American woman named Khenmo Drolma who is the first ""bhikkhunni"", a fully ordained Buddhist nun, in the Drikung Kagyu tradition of Buddhism, having been ordained in Taiwan in 2002. She is also the first westerner, male or female, to be installed as a Buddhist abbot, having been installed as abbot of Vajra Dakini Nunnery in 2004.

Theravada
Theravada is best known for Vipassana, roughly translated as ""insight meditation"", which is an ancient meditative practice described in the Pali Canon of the Theravada school of Buddhism and similar scriptures. Vipassana also refers to a distinct movement which was begun in the 20th century by reformers such as Mahāsi Sayādaw, a Burmese monk. Mahāsi Sayādaw was a Theravada bhikkhu and Vipassana is rooted in the Theravada teachings, but its goal is to simplify ritual and other peripheral activities in order to make meditative practice more effective and available both to monks and to laypeople.

American Theravada Buddhists
In 1965, monks from Sri Lanka established the Washington Buddhist Vihara in Washington, DC, the first Theravada monastic community in the United States. The Vihara was accessible to English-speakers with Vipassana meditation part of its activities. However, the direct influence of the Vipassana movement would not reach the U.S. until a group of Americans returned there in the early 1970s after studying with Vipassana masters in Asia.
Joseph Goldstein, after journeying to Southeast Asia with the Peace Corps, lived in Bodhgaya as a student of Anagarika Munindra, the head monk of Mahabodhi Temple and himself a student of Māhāsai Sayādaw. Jack Kornfield also worked for the Peace Corps in Southeast Asia, and then studied and ordained in the Thai Forest Tradition under Ajahn Chah, a major figure in 20th-century Thai Buddhism. Sharon Salzberg went to India in 1971 and studied with Dipa Ma, a former Calcutta housewife trained in vipassana by Māhāsai Sayādaw. The Thai Forest Tradition also has a number of branch monasteries in the United States, including Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery (Ajahn Pasanno, Abbot), Metta Forest Monastery (with Thanissaro Bhikkhu as Abbot) and Jetavana Temple Forest Monastery.
Goldstein and Kornfield met in 1974 while teaching at the Naropa Institute in Colorado. The next year, Goldstein, Kornfield, and Salzberg, who had very recently returned from Calcutta, along with Jacqueline Schwarz, founded the Insight Meditation Society on an 80-acre (324,000 m2) property near Barre, Massachusetts. IMS hosted visits by Māhāsi Sayādaw, Munindra, Ajahn Chah, and Dipa Ma. In 1981, Kornfield moved to California, where he founded another Vipassana center, Spirit Rock Meditation Center, in Marin County. In 1985, Larry Rosenberg founded the Cambridge Insight Meditation Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Another Vipassana center is the Vipassana Metta Foundation, located on Maui. ""When a Retreat Center course is in progress, anyone who is not already participating in the retreat is welcome to attend the evening talks about the teachings, known as Dharma talks. Those with insight meditation experience are also welcome to attend group sittings."" Dharma talks are available for free download, a service provided by Dharma Seed.
In 1989, the Insight Meditation Center established the Barre Center for Buddhist Studies near the IMS headquarters, to promote scholarly investigation of Buddhism. Its first director was Mu Soeng, a former Korean Zen monk.
In the early 1990s, Ajahn Amaro made several teaching trips to northern California. Many who attended his meditation retreats became enthusiastic about the possibility of establishing a permanent monastic community in the area. In the meantime, Amaravati Monastery in England received a substantial donation of land in Mendocino County from Chan Master Hsuan Hua. The land was allocated to establish a forest monastery. Abhayagiri Monastery was established and placed in the hands of a group of lay practitioners, the Sanghapala Foundation. Ajahn Pasanno moved to California on New Year's Eve of 1997 to share the abbotship of Abhayagiri Monastery, Redwood Valley, California, with Ajahn Amaro.
In 1997 Dhamma Cetiya Vihara in Boston was founded by Ven. Gotami of Thailand, then a 10 precept nun. Ven. Gotami received full ordination in 2000, at which time her dwelling became America's first Theravada Buddhist bhikkhuni vihara. ""Vihara"" translates as monastery or nunnery, and may be both dwelling and community center where one or more bhikkhus or bhikkhunis offer teachings on Buddhist scriptures, conduct traditional ceremonies, teach meditation, offer counseling and other community services, receive alms, and reside. More recently established Theravada bhikkhuni viharas include: Mahapajapati Monastery where several nuns (bhikkhunis and novices) live together in the desert of southern California near Joshua Tree, founded by Ven. Gunasari Bhikkhuni of Burma in 2008; Aranya Bodhi Hermitage founded by Ven. Tathaaloka Bhikkhuni in the forest near Jenner, CA, with Ven. Sobhana Bhikkhuni as Prioress, which opened officially in July 2010, where several bhikkhunis reside together along with trainees and lay supporters; and Sati Saraniya in Ontario, founded by Ven. Medhanandi in appx 2009, where two bhikkhunis reside. In 2009 Aloka Vihara Forest Monastery in the Sierra Foothills of California was created by Ayya Anandabodhi and Ayya Santacitta. (There are also quiet residences of individual bhikkhunis where they may receive visitors and give teachings, such as the residence of Ven. Amma Thanasanti Bhikkhuni in 2009–2010 in Colorado Springs; and the Los Angeles residence of Ven. Susila Bhikkhuni; and the residence of Ven. Wimala Bhikkhuni in the mid-west.)
In 2010, in Northern California, four novice nuns were given the full bhikkhuni ordination in the Thai Theravada tradition, which included the double ordination ceremony. Bhante Gunaratana and other monks and nuns were in attendance. It was the first such ordination ever in the Western hemisphere.
Bhante Gunaratana is currently the abbot of the Bhavana Society, a monastery and meditation retreat center that he founded in High View, West Virginia.

S. N. Goenka
S. N. Goenka was a Burmese-born meditation teacher of the Vipassana movement. His teacher, Sayagyi U Ba Khin of Burma, was a contemporary of Māhāsi Sayādaw's, and taught a style of Buddhism with similar emphasis on simplicity and accessibility to laypeople. Goenka established a method of instruction popular in Asia and throughout the world. In 1981, he established the Vipassana Research Institute in Igatpuri, India, and his students built several centers in North America.

Association of American Buddhists
The Association of American Buddhists was a group which promotes Buddhism through publications, ordination of monks, and classes.
Organized in 1960 by American practitioners of Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana Buddhism, it does not espouse any particular school or schools of Buddhism. It respects all Buddhist traditions as equal, and encourages unity of Buddhism in thought and practice. It states that a different, American, form of Buddhism is possible, and that the cultural forms attached to the older schools of Buddhism need not necessarily be followed by westerners.

Women and Buddhism
Rita M. Gross, a feminist religious scholar, claims that multiple people converted to Buddhism in the 1960s and 1970s as an attempt to combat traditional American values. However, in their conversion, they have created a new form of Buddhism distinctly Western in thought and practice. Democratization and the rise of women in leadership positions have been among the most influential characteristics of American Buddhism. However, another one of these characteristics is rationalism, which has allowed Buddhists to come to terms with the scientific and technological advances of the 21st century. Engagement in social issues, such as global warming, domestic violence, poverty and discrimination, has also shaped Buddhism in America. Privatization of ritual practices into home life has embodied Buddhism in America. The idea of living in the ""present life"" rather than focusing on the future or the past is also another characteristic of American Buddhism.
American Buddhism was able to embed these new religious ideals into such a historically rich religious tradition and culture due to the high conversion rate in the late 20th century. Three important factors led to this conversion in America: the importance of religion, societal openness, and spirituality. American culture places a large emphasis on having a personal religious identity as a spiritual and ethical foundation. During the 1960s and onward, society also became more open to other religious practices outside of Protestantism, allowing more people to explore Buddhism. People also became more interested in spiritual and experiential religion rather than the traditional institutional religions of the time.
The mass conversion of the 60s and 70s was also occurring alongside the second-wave feminist movement. While some of the women who became Buddhists at this time were drawn to its ""gender neutral"" teachings, in reality Buddhism is a traditionally patriarchal religion. These two conflicting ideas caused ""uneasiness"" with American Buddhist women. This uneasiness was further justified after 1983, when some male Buddhist teachers were exposed as ""sexual adventurers and abusers of power."" This spurred action among women in the American Buddhist community. After much dialogue within the community, including a series of conferences entitled ""The Feminine in Buddhism"", Sandy Boucher, a feminist-Buddhist teacher, interviewed over one hundred Buddhist women. She determined from their experiences and her own that American Buddhism has ""the possibility for the creation of a religion fully inclusive of women's realities, in which women hold both institutional and spiritual leadership.""
In recent years, there is a strong presence of women in American Buddhism, and a number of women are even in leadership roles. This also may be due to the fact that American Buddhism tends to stress democratization over the traditional hierarchical structure of Buddhism in Asia. One study of Theravada Buddhist centers in the U.S., however, found that although men and women thought that Buddhist teachings were gender-blind, there were still distinct gender roles in the organization, including more male guest teachers and more women volunteering as cooks and cleaners.
In 1936, Sunya Gladys Pratt was ordained as a Buddhist minister in the Shin tradition in the Tacoma, Washington.
In 1976, Karuna Dharma became the first fully ordained female member of the Buddhist monastic community in the U.S.
In 1981, Ani Pema Chodron, an American woman, was ordained as a bhikkhuni in a lineage of Tibetan Buddhism. Pema Chödrön was the first American woman to be ordained as a Buddhist nun in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition.
In 1988, Jetsunma Ahkon Lhamo, an American woman formerly called Catharine Burroughs, became the first Western woman to be named a reincarnate lama.
In 1998, Sherry Chayat became the first American woman to receive transmission in the Rinzai school of Buddhism.
In 2002, Khenmo Drolma, an American woman, became the first bhikkhuni in the Drikung Kagyu lineage of Buddhism, traveling to Taiwan to be ordained. In 2004 she became the first westerner of either sex to be installed as an abbot in the Drikung Kagyu lineage of Buddhism, being installed as the abbot of the Vajra Dakini Nunnery in Vermont (America's first Tibetan Buddhist nunnery) in 2004.
In 2003, Ayya Sudhamma Bhikkhuni became the first American-born woman to gain bhikkhuni ordination in the Theravada school in Sri Lanka.
In 2006, for the first time in American history, a Buddhist ordination was held where an American woman (Sister Khanti-Khema) took the Samaneri (novice) vows with an American monk (Bhante Vimalaramsi) presiding. This was done for the Buddhist American Forest Tradition at the Dhamma Sukha Meditation Center in Missouri. Also in 2006, Merle Kodo Boyd, born in Texas, became the first African-American woman ever to receive Dharma transmission in Zen Buddhism.
In 2010, the first Tibetan Buddhist nunnery in America (Vajra Dakini Nunnery in Vermont), offering novice ordination in the Drikung Kagyu lineage of Buddhism, was officially consecrated.
In 2022, Terri Omori is appointed the first female president of the 12,000 member strong Buddhist Churches of America.

Contemporary developments
Engaged Buddhism
Socially engaged Buddhism has developed in Buddhism in the West. While some critics assert the term is redundant, as it is mistaken to believe that Buddhism in the past has not affected and been affected by the surrounding society, others have suggested that Buddhism is sometimes seen as too passive toward public life. This is particularly true in the West, where almost all converts to Buddhism come to it outside of an existing family or community tradition. Engaged Buddhism is an attempt to apply Buddhist values to larger social problems, including war and environmental concerns. The term was coined by Thích Nhất Hạnh, during his years as a peace activist in Vietnam. 
The Buddhist Peace Fellowship was founded in 1978 by Robert Aitken, Anne Aitken, Nelson Foster, and others and received early assistance from Gary Snyder, Jack Kornfield, and Joanna Macy. 
Another engaged Buddhist group is the Zen Peacemaker Order, founded in 1996 by Bernie Glassman and Sandra Jishu Holmes.
In 2007, the American Buddhist scholar-monk, Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi, was invited to write an editorial essay for the Buddhist magazine Buddhadharma. In his essay, he called attention to the narrowly inward focus of American Buddhism, which has been pursued to the neglect of the active dimension of Buddhist compassion expressed through programs of social engagement. Several of Ven. Bodhi's students who read the essay felt a desire to follow up on his suggestions. After a few rounds of discussions, they resolved to form a Buddhist relief organization dedicated to alleviating the suffering of the poor and disadvantaged in the developing world. At the initial meetings, seeking a point of focus, they decided to direct their relief efforts at the problem of global hunger, especially by supporting local efforts by those in developing countries to achieve self-sufficiency through improved food productivity. Contacts were made with leaders and members of other Buddhist communities in the greater New York area, and before long Buddhist Global Relief emerged as an inter-denominational organization comprising people of different Buddhist groups who share the vision of a Buddhism actively committed to the task of alleviating social and economic suffering.

Misconduct
A number of groups and individuals have been implicated in scandals. Sandra Bell has analysed the scandals at Vajradhatu and the San Francisco Zen Center and concluded that these kinds of scandals are most likely to occur in organisations that are in transition between the pure forms of charismatic authority that brought them into being and more rational, corporate forms of organization"". She also highlights the student-teacher dynamic and the significance of a spiritual leader in the West, where lay Buddhist are likely focused on practices such as meditation. This teacher must know the student to guide them through difficulties, and the student must be trusting and open with the teacher, this can be a powerful opportunity but also opens the door to potential issues. 
Ford states that no one can express the ""hurt and dismay"" these events brought to each center, and that the centers have in a number of cases emerged stronger because they no longer depend on a ""single charismatic leader"".
Robert Sharf also mentions charisma from which institutional power is derived, and the need to balance charismatic authority with institutional authority. Elaborate analyses of these scandals are made by Stuart Lachs, who mentions the uncritical acceptance of religious narratives, such as lineages and dharma transmission, which aid in giving uncritical charismatic powers to teachers and leaders.
Following is a partial list from reliable sources, limited to the United States and by no means all-inclusive. 

In 1983, the San Francisco Zen Center experienced a sex scandal resulting in the resignation of abbot Richard Baker.
Taizan Maezumi slept with several of his students at the Zen Center of Los Angeles and he died of alcoholism.
In 1988, Seung Sahn had sexual affairs with several of his students in the Kwan Um School of Zen.
Tibetan Buddhist teacher Chögyam Trungpa openly had sexual relationships with numbers of female members of his sangha, and died of health complications from his quite public alcoholism.
Trungpa's Dharma heir Ösel Tendzin contracted and later died from complications of the AIDS virus. Knowing himself to be infected, Tendzin had unprotected sex with at least two of his male students. One of them later died of AIDS.
In 2010, Shasta Abbey abbot and successor to Houn Jiyu-Kennett Eko Little resigned and subsequently disrobed after admitting to forming a sexual relationship with one of the members of the lay congregation.
In 2010, Eido Tai Shimano retired from the Zen Studies Society after admitting to sexual liaisons.
In 2011 because of sexual misconduct, Dennis Merzel said he would disrobe as a Buddhist priest and resign as an elder of the White Plum Asanga.
Several women have accused Joshu Sasaki of making sexual advances over the course of decades, and scandal struck the Cimarron Zen Center in Los Angeles.

Accreditation
Definitions and policies may differ greatly between different schools or sects: for example, ""many, perhaps most"" Soto priests ""see no distinction between ordination and Dharma transmission"". Disagreement and misunderstanding exist on this point, among lay practitioners and Zen teachers alike.
James Ford writes,

[S]urprising numbers of people use the titles Zen teacher, master, roshi and sensei without any obvious connections to Zen [...] Often they obfuscate their Zen connections, raising the very real question whether they have any authentic relationship to the Zen world at all. In my studies I've run across literally dozens of such cases.
James Ford claims that about eighty percent of authentic teachers in the United States belong to the American Zen Teachers Association or the Soto Zen Buddhist Association and are listed on their websites. This can help a prospective student sort out who is a ""normative stream"" teacher from someone who is perhaps not, but of course twenty percent do not participate.

Demographics of Buddhism in the United States
Numbers of Buddhists
Accurate counts of Buddhists in the United States are difficult. Self-description has pitfalls. Because Buddhism is a cultural concept, individuals who self-describe as Buddhists may have little knowledge or commitment to Buddhism as a religion or practice; on the other hand, others may be deeply involved in meditation and committed to the Dharma, but may refuse the label ""Buddhist"". In the 1990s, Robert A. F. Thurman estimated there were 5 to 6 million Buddhists in America.
In a 2007 Pew Research Center survey, at 0.7% Buddhism was the third largest religion in the US after Christianity (78.4%), no religion (10.3%) and Judaism (1.7%). In 2012 on the occasion of a visit from the Dalai Lama, U-T San Diego said there are 1.2 million Buddhist practitioners in the U.S., and of them 40% live in Southern California.
In 2008 the ""Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life Religious Landscape Survey"" estimated American Buddhists at 0.7% of the American population. During the same year the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS), estimated this same figure at 0.5%. ARIS estimated that the number of adherents rose by 170% between 1990 and 2000, reaching 1.2 million followers in 2008. According to William Wilson Quinn ""by all indications that remarkable rate of growth continues unabated."" But according to Robert Thurman, 

Scholars are unsure whether the reports are accurate, as Americans who might dabble in various forms of Buddhism may not identify themselves as Buddhist on a survey. That makes it difficult to quantify the number of Buddhists in the United States.
Others argued, in 2012, that Buddhists made up 1 percent of the American population (about three million people).  By the year 2050 Buddhism is projected to become the third largest major religious group in North America, after Christianity and Islam.

Demographics of Buddhist Converts
A sociological survey conducted in 1999 found that relative to the US population as a whole, Buddhist converts are proportionately more likely to be white, upper middle class, highly educated, and left-leaning in their political views. In terms of race, only 10% of survey respondents indicated they were a race other than white, a matter that has been cause of some concern among Buddhist leaders. Nearly a third of the respondents were college graduates, and more than half held advanced degrees. Politically, 60% identified themselves as Democrats, and Green Party affiliations outnumbered Republicans by 3 to 1. Buddhist converts were also proportionately more likely to have come from Catholic, and especially Jewish backgrounds. More than half of these adherents came to Buddhism through reading books on the topic, with the rest coming by way of martial arts and friends or acquaintances. The average age of the respondents was 46. Daily meditation was their most commonly cited Buddhist practice, with most meditating 30 minutes a day or more.   
In 2015 a Pew Foundation survey found 67% of American Buddhists were raised in a religion other than Buddhism. 61% said their spouse has a religion other than Buddhism. It also showed that one-third of Buddhists in America are of Asian descent, while the remaining three-fourths are converts to Buddhism. The survey was conducted only in English and Spanish, and may under-estimate Buddhist immigrants who speak Asian languages. A 2012 Pew study found Buddhism is practiced by 15% of surveyed Chinese Americans, 6% of Koreans, 25% of Japanese, 43% of Vietnamese and 1% of Filipinos.

Ethnic divide
Although the 2008 Pew Landscape Study suggested white Americans made up the majority of Buddhists in the United States, subsequent research has refuted this conclusion, first on the study's small data set, second on significant methodological errors, and third on subsequent research published by Pew in the 2012 survey of religious life of Asian Americans. Based on this latter study's data, Asian American Buddhists make up approximately 67–69% of all Buddhists in the United States.
Discussion about Buddhism in America has sometimes focused on the issue of the visible ethnic divide separating ethnic Buddhist congregations from import Buddhist groups. Although multiple Zen and Tibetan Buddhist temples were founded by Asians, they now attract fewer Asian-Americans. With the exception of Sōka Gakkai, almost all active Buddhist groups in America are either ethnic or import Buddhism based on the demographics of their membership. There is often limited contact between Buddhists of different ethnic groups.
However, the cultural divide should not necessarily be seen as pernicious. It is often argued that the differences between Buddhist groups arise benignly from the differing needs and interests of those involved. Convert Buddhists tend to be interested in meditation and philosophy, in some cases eschewing the trappings of religiosity altogether. On the other hand, for immigrants and their descendants, preserving tradition and maintaining a social framework assume a much greater relative importance, making their approach to religion naturally more conservative. Further, based on a survey of Asian-American Buddhists in San Francisco, ""many Asian-American Buddhists view non-Asian Buddhism as still in a formative, experimental stage"" and yet they believe that it ""could eventually mature into a religious expression of exceptional quality"".
Additional questions come from the demographics within import Buddhism. The majority of American converts practicing at Buddhist centers are white, often from Christian or Jewish backgrounds. Only Sōka Gakkai has attracted significant numbers of African-American or Latino members. A variety of ideas have been broached regarding the nature, causes, and significance of this racial uniformity. Journalist Clark Strand noted

…that it has tried to recruit [African-Americans] at all makes Sōka Gakkai International utterly unique in American Buddhism.
Strand, writing for Tricycle (an American Buddhist journal) in 2004, notes that SGI has specifically targeted African-Americans, Latinos and Asians, and other writers have noted that this approach has begun to spread, with Vipassana and Theravada retreats aimed at non-white practitioners led by a handful of specific teachers.
A question is the degree of importance ascribed to discrimination, which is suggested to be mostly unconscious, on the part of white converts toward potential minority converts. To some extent, the racial divide indicates a class divide, because convert Buddhists tend to be more educated. Among African American Buddhists who commented on the dynamics of the racial divide in convert Buddhism are Jan Willis and Charles R. Johnson.
A Pew study shows that Americans tend to be less biased towards Buddhists when compared to other religions, such as Christianity, to which 18% of people were biased, when only 14% were biased towards Buddhists. American Buddhists are often not raised as Buddhists, with 32% of American Buddhists being raised Protestant, and 22% being raised Catholic, which means that over half of the American Buddhists were converted at some point in time. Also, Buddhism has had to adapt to America in order to garner more followers so that the concept would not seem so foreign, so they adopted ""Catholic"" words such as ""worship"" and ""churches"".

Buddhist education in the United States
Chögyam Trungpa founded Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado, a four-year Buddhist college in the US (now Naropa University) in 1974. Allen Ginsberg was an initial faculty member, christening the institute's poetry department the ""Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics"". Now Naropa University, the school offers accredited degrees in a number of subjects, many not directly related to Buddhism.
The University of the West is affiliated with Hsi Lai Temple and was previously Hsi Lai University. Soka University of America, in Aliso Viejo California, was founded by the Sōka Gakkai as a secular school committed to philosophic Buddhism. The City of Ten Thousand Buddhas is the site of Dharma Realm Buddhist University, a four-year college teaching courses primarily related to Buddhism but including some general-interest subjects. The Institute of Buddhist Studies in Berkeley, California, in addition to offering a master's degree in Buddhist Studies acts as the ministerial training arm of the Buddhist Churches of America and is affiliated with the Graduate Theological Union. The school moved into the Jodo Shinshu Center in Berkeley.
The first Buddhist high school in the United States, Developing Virtue Secondary School, was founded in 1981 by the Dharma Realm Buddhist Association at their branch monastery in the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas in Ukiah, California. In 1997, the Purple Lotus Buddhist School offered elementary-level classes in Union City, California, affiliated with the True Buddha School; it added a middle school in 1999 and a high school in 2001. Another Buddhist high school, Tinicum Art and Science now The Lotus School of Liberal Arts, which combines Zen practice and traditional liberal arts, opened in Ottsville, Pennsylvania, in 1998. It is associated informally with the World Shim Gum Do Association in Boston. The Pacific Buddhist Academy opened in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 2003. It shares a campus with the Hongwanji Mission School, an elementary and middle school; both schools affiliated with the Honpa Hongwanji Jodo Shinshu mission.
Juniper Foundation, founded in 2003, holds that Buddhist methods must become integrated into modern culture just as they were in other cultures. Juniper Foundation calls its approach ""Buddhist training for modern life"" and it emphasizes meditation, balancing emotions, cultivating compassion and developing insight as four building blocks of Buddhist training.

Jain immigration began in earnest in the late 1960s and continues to the present day.

History
In 1893, Virachand Gandhi became the first Jain delegate to visit the United States, representing Jainism in the first ever Parliament of World Religions. As the first practicing Jain to speak publicly in the United States on Jainism, he is a key figure in the history of American Jainism. The first St. Louis Jain temple in the United States was built for the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. After the fair, the temple moved to Las Vegas and later to Los Angeles. It is now owned by the Jain Center of Southern California. Adherents of Jainism first arrived in the United States in 1944. Jain immigration began in earnest in the late 1960s after the passage of the Immigration Act of 1965. The United States has since become a center of the Jain diaspora.

The first former Jain monastic to travel to the United States, Chitrabhanu, arrived in 1971. He gave several lectures about Jainism at Harvard University and established a Jain center in New York City. The first monk who traveled outside India by use of mechanical means was Acharya Sushil Kumar who arrived in the United States in 1975. He established multiple Jain centers, including International Mahavira Jain Mission popularly known as Siddhachalam. In the 1980s, he and Chitrabhanu inspired the founding of Federation of Jain Associations in North America to support the Jain community in the United States and Canada.
As of 2010 the United States contained the most Jain temples of any country in the Jain diaspora. At least one third of the Jains living outside India live in the United States, numbering close to 150,000. Jain temples in the United States, which numbered 26 as of 2006, frequently incorporate marble and arches in a style reminiscent of Rajasthan architecture. There are almost 100 distinct Jain congregations in the United States.
Many Jains in the United States are professionals. They also frequently volunteer at animal welfare organizations. Many Jains also attend Hindu temples and Hindu events.

Jain sects
According to The Pluralism Project at Harvard University, ""Most American Jains agree that the sectarian streams of Jainism that have been significant in India for 2,000 years are fast losing their currency in 20th century America...The sectarian divisions of the Jain tradition have been left behind as Jain Americans concentrate on the difficult task of appropriating the tradition in a new environment."" As noted below, many Jain temples in the United States contain images from both the Digambara and Śvētāmbara traditions. Jain conventions and gatherings in America feature teachings from both sects.

Federation of Jain Associations in North America and Siddhachalam
The Federation of Jain Associations in North America is an umbrella organization of local American and Canadian Jain congregations to preserve, practice, and promote Jainism and the Jain way of life. Siddhachalam in New Jersey is the first pilgrimage site for Jains outside India, bringing together all Jains in one place for worship, study and reflection.

Jain symbols
The Federation of Jain Associations in North America uses a modified version of the standard Jain symbol, the Jain emblem. It replaces the swastika with an om because the former is not considered a pious symbol in the western world.

Jain studies
Florida International University hosts the Bhagwan Mahavir Professorship in Jain Studies, the first Jain Studies chair at a North American university. In 2016, the Jain Society and Rice University signed a memorandum of understanding to establish a post-doctoral fellowship in Jain studies.

American Jain centers
Category:Jain temples in the United States

The Jain Center of America was the first Jain center in the United States. It opened in New York City in 1982. Since then, over 100 Jain centers and temples have opened in America. Most Jain centers are complexes that include a main temple housing Digambara and Śvētāmbara images, libraries, meeting rooms, guest rooms, and so forth.

Overview
Native American religions were prevalent in the pre-Columbian era, including state religions. Common concept is the supernatural world of deities, spirits and wonders, such as the Algonquian manitou or the Lakotaʼs wakan, as well as Great Spirit, Fifth World, world tree, and the red road among many Indians.
Before the Christian influence, in most American religions was known High God—a supreme Creator and Teacher, such as the Inca god Viracocha in South America, or sky deity/Great Spirit who represents all other spiritual beings, for instance, the Pawnee god Tirawa in North America. The supreme beings closely associated with the World Tree, or world pole/pillar—the central cultic symbol in the great rites of the main regions especially of Northern America. Other traditional pre-Modern religious rites were hunting, gathering, planting, and war ceremonies.
During the 16th–21st centuries, Native American spirituality had numerous new indigenist revitalization movements that divided to fundamentalist and reform.
Generally fundamentalist movements favoured a return to traditional ways and rejected the changes brought by the modern states, in North America they include the Pueblo Revolt (1680s), the Shawnee Prophet Movement (1805–1811), the Cherokee Prophet Movement (1811–1813), the Red Stick War (1813–1814), White Path's Rebellion (1826), the Winnebago Prophet Movement (1830–1832), the first Ghost Dance (1869–1870) and the second Ghost Dance (1889–1890), and the Snake movements among the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Muscogee Creek Indians during the 1890s.
Generally syncretic reform movements include the Yaqui Religion (1500–present), the Longhouse Religion (1797–present), the Munsee Prophetess Movement (1804–1805), the Kickapoo Prophet Movement (1815–present), the Cherokee Keetoowah Society (1858–present), the Washat Dreamers Religion (1850–present), the Indian Shakers (1881–present), the Native American Church (1800s–present), the Shoshoni Sun Dance (1890–present), the New Tidings religion or Wocekiye of the Canadian Sioux (1900–present), and Ojibwe Drummer Movement (contemporary).
Beginning in the 1600s, European Christians, both Catholics and those of various Protestant denominations, sought to convert Native American tribes from their pre-existing beliefs to Christianity. After the United States gained independence in the late 1700s, its government continued to suppress Indigenous practices and promote forcible conversion. American and Canadian government agencies and religious organizations often cooperated in these forcible conversion efforts. In many cases, violence was used as a tool of suppression, as in the government's violent eradication of Ghost Dance and Sun Dance practitioners in 1890s. Thus, Canada lifted its prohibition against the practice of the Sun Dance full ceremony only in 1951.
By the turn of the 20th century, the American government began to turn to less violent means of suppressing Native American religious beliefs. A series of federal laws was passed banning traditional Indigenous practices such as feasts, Sun Dance ceremonies and the use of the sweat lodge, among others. This government persecution and prosecution officially continued until 1978 with the passage of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (AIRFA), although it has been argued that the AIRFA had little real effect on the protection of Native religious beliefs.
Another significant system of religious suppression was the removal of Native American children from their families into a system of government-funded and church-operated American Indian boarding schools (also known as residential schools). In these schools, Native children were forced through violence and oppression to learn European Christian beliefs, the values of mainstream white culture, and the English language, while simultaneously being forbidden to speak their own languages and practice their own cultural beliefs. This system of forcible conversion and suppression of Indigenous languages and cultures continued through the 1970s.
Some non-Native anthropologists estimate membership in traditional Native American religions in the 21st century to be about 9000 people. Since Native Americans practicing traditional ceremonies do not usually have public organizations or membership rolls, these ""members"" estimates are likely substantially lower than the actual numbers of people who participate in traditional ceremonies. Native American spiritual leaders also note that these academic estimates substantially underestimate the numbers of participants because a century of US Federal government persecution and prosecutions of traditional ceremonies caused believers to practice their religions in secrecy. Many adherents of traditional spiritual ways also attend Christian services, at least some of the time, which can also affect statistics. Since the 80 years of those prior legal persecutions ended with AIRFA, some sacred sites in the United States are now protected areas under law.

Regional and pan-Native traditions
Alaska and Far North
The living in the North American Arctic and sub-Arctic Alaska Natives and many Indigenous peoples in Canada mainly practice hunter-gatherer religious cults. Traditional Alaskan shamanism involve mediation between people and spirits, souls, and other immortal beings.

Western North America
Western North America includes such cultural areas as Northwest Coast, Plateau, Great Basin, and a region of the Indigenous peoples of California.

Earth Lodge Religion
The Earth Lodge Religion was founded in northern California and southern Oregon tribes such as the Wintun. It spread to tribes such as the Achomawi, Shasta, and Siletz, to name a few. It was also known as the ""Warm House Dance"" among the Pomo. It predicted occurrences similar to those predicted by the Ghost Dance, such as the return of ancestors or the world's end. The Earth Lodge Religion impacted the later religious practice, the Dream Dance, belonging to the Klamath and the Modoc.

Washat Dreamers Religion
The Washat Dreamers Religion, also called the Waashat Religion/Faith, the Waasaní (Washani) Religion, Seven Drum Religion, and the Longhouse religion (separate from the Iroquois Longhouse religion) is a faith still persisting in some modern Native communities. Washani, meaning ""dancers"" or ""worship"", was a reform response to pressures from American settlers at the time for Natives to relocate or become ""civilized"". The Wanapum Indian Smohalla (c. 1815 – 1895) originally built the religion in 1850 in the Columbia River region of modern-day Washington, and over time it has spread across the Pacific Northwest. Smohalla claimed that he had received visions in his dreams, where he had visited the spirit world and had been sent back to teach his people. He preached a reform return to the original way of life of hunter-gatherer lifestyle as opposed to agriculturalism, before the influence of colonizers, emphasizing abstinence from alcohol and cleansing themselves of white influences. Smohalla was sometimes called Yuyunipitqana, meaning ""Shouting Mountain"", because it was said that his wisdom came from a mountain speaking within his soul.
The religion combined elements of Christianity with Native beliefs, teaching similar origin stories as Catholicism and holding Sunday as a holy day, while still ultimately pushing away from the so-called civilized man that white people idealized. Despite this, Smohalla rejected the Christian Puritanical ideal of a strong work ethic and plowing the land. Two notable quotes of Smohalla's ""You ask me to plough the ground! Shall I take a knife and tear my mother's bosom?"" and ""My young men shall never work. Men who work can not dream, and wisdom comes to us in dreams,"" demonstrates these tenets. The Native-inspired elements of the religion involved the Waashat Dance, a dance which involves seven drummers, a salmon feast, use of eagle and swan feathers and a sacred song sung every seventh day.
The Dreamer Faith foreshadowed the later Ghost Dances of the plains peoples, another religion which sought to rid Natives of white people and their influences through peaceful religion. These kinds of religions made it difficult to assimilate or control the tribes by the United States, as the U.S. was trying to convert the Plains tribes from hunter-gatherers to farmers; farming was believed to be more civilized and a better use of the land. They wanted to remake the Natives, but found a problem with those who followed the Waashat Religion: ""Their model of a man is an Indian; They aspire to be Indian and nothing else."" (T. B. Odeneal) Smohalla was eventually jailed in an effort to quell a potential uprising of Native peoples, but his religion has continued to survive without him.

Indian Shaker Church
Also known as Tschida, the Indian Shaker Church was influenced by the Waashat Religion and founded by John Slocum, a Squaxin Island member. The name comes from the shaking and twitching motions used by the participants to brush off their sins. The religion combines Christianity with traditional Indian teachings.

Great Plains
The Great Plains is home to religious traditions of more than fifty Plains Indians nations that are some of the most varied and complex in Northern America.

Ghost Dance
The Ghost Dance movement of the late 1800s was a religious revitalization movement in the Western United States. Initially founded as a local ceremony in Nevada, by the Paiute prophet Wodziwob, the movement did not gain widespread popularity until 1889–1890, when the Ghost Dance Religion was founded by Wovoka (Jack Wilson), who was also Northern Paiute. The Ghost Dance was created in a time of genocide, to save the lives of the Native Americans by enabling them to survive the current and coming catastrophes, by calling the dead to fight on their behalf, and to help them drive the colonists out of their lands.
In December 1888, Wovoka, who was thought to be the son of the medicine man Tavibo (Numu-tibo'o), fell sick with a fever during an eclipse of the sun, which occurred on January 1, 1889. Upon his recovery, he claimed that he had visited the spirit world and the Supreme Being and predicted that the world would soon end, then be restored to a pure state in the presence of the Messiah. All Native Americans would inherit this world, including those who were already dead, in order to live eternally without suffering. In order to reach this reality, Wovoka stated that all Native Americans should live honestly, and shun the ways of whites (especially the consumption of alcohol). He called for meditation, prayer, singing, and dancing as an alternative to mourning the dead, for they would soon resurrect. Wovoka's followers saw him as a form of the messiah and he became known as the ""Red Man's Christ.""
Tavibo had participated in the Ghost Dance of 1870 and had a similar vision of the Great Spirit of Earth removing all white men, and then of an earthquake removing all human beings. Tavibo's vision concluded that Native Americans would return to live in a restored environment and that only believers in his revelations would be resurrected.
This religion spread to many tribes on reservations in the West, including the Shoshone, Arapaho, Cheyenne, and Sioux (Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota). In fact, some bands of Lakota and Dakota were so desperate for hope during this period of forced relocation and genocide that, after making a pilgrimage to the Nevada Ghost Dance in 1889–1890, they became more militant in their resistance to the white colonists. Each Nation that adopted the Ghost Dance way provided their own understanding to the ceremony, which included the prediction that the white people would disappear, die, or be driven back across the sea. A Ghost Dance gathering at Wounded Knee in December 1890 was invaded by the Seventh Cavalry, who massacred unarmed Lakota and Dakota people, primarily women, children and the elderly.
The earliest Ghost Dance heavily influenced religions such as the Earth Lodge, Bole-Maru Religion, and the Dream Dance. The Caddo Nation and several other communities still practice the Ghost Dance today, though usually in secret.

Wocekiye
Wocekiye is a faith and practice among Dakota and Lakota peoples engaged in both the traditional Dakota and Lakota religion as well as forms of Christianity.

North-Eastern America
The most prominent tribes of the Northeast Woodlands in the U.S. and Canada are Algonquin, Iroquoian and Siouan-speaking peoples.

Hudson Bay Interior/Subarctic
The Cree, including Omushkego, beliefs similar to Anishinaabe traditional beliefs, different structure.

Great Lakes Region
Midewiwin or the Grand Medicine Society and Wabunowin or the Dawn Society are a traditional religious organisations of the Anishinaabe (Ojibwe) and some others of the Natives of the Maritimes, New England and Great Lakes regions.

Longhouse Religion
The Longhouse Religion is the popular name of the religious movement known as The Code of Handsome Lake or Gaihwi:io (""Good Message""), founded in 1797/1799 by the Seneca prophet Handsome Lake (Sganyodaiyoʔ). He combines and reinterprets elements of traditional Seneca beliefs with a revised code such as must refrain from drinking, selling of land, intensive animal farming and witchcraft meant to revive traditional consciousness after a long period of cultural disintegration following colonization.

South-Eastern North America
The native religions of the U.S. region are held in common among the Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands, who mainly practiced the Green Corn Ceremony and other agriculture cults.

Keetoowah Society
The Cherokee Keetoowah Society is a reform religious and political organisation formed in 1858 and re-established ca. 1900 that intended to preserve and practice traditional Cherokee spiritual beliefs or ""old ways"" of tribal life, based on religious nationalism.

Four Mothers Society
The Four Mothers Society is a religious in nature traditionalist organisation of Muscogee, Cherokee, Choctaw and Chickasaw peoples that formally founded about 1895 and remains active today.

South-Western North America
The native nations of the Southwestern U.S. and Mexico mainly practiced maize and other agriculture cults.

Mexicayotl
Mexicayotl (Nahuatl word meaning ""Essence of the Mexican"", ""Mexicanity""; Spanish: Mexicanidad; see -yotl) is a movement reviving the indigenous religion, philosophy and traditions of ancient Mexico (Aztec religion and Aztec philosophy) amongst the indigenous peoples of Mexico.
The movement came to light in the 1950s, led by Mexico City intellectuals, but has grown significantly on a grassroots level only in more recent times, also spreading to the Chicanos of North America. Their rituals involve the mitotiliztli. The followers, called Mexicatl (singular) and Mexicah (plural), or simply Mexica, are mostly urban and suburban people.
The Mexicayotl movement started in the 1950s with the founding of the group Nueva Mexicanidad by Antonio Velasco Piña. In the same years, Rodolfo Nieva López founded the Movimiento Confederado Restaurador de la Cultura del Anáhuac, the co-founder of which was Francisco Jimenez Sanchez who in later decades became a spiritual leader of the Mexicayotl movement, endowed with the honorific Tlacaelel. He had a deep influence in shaping the movement, founding the In Kaltonal (""House of the Sun"", also called Native Mexican Church) in the 1970s.
From the 1970s onwards Mexcayotl has grown developing in a web of local worship and community groups (called calpulli or kalpulli) and spreading to the Mexican Americans or Chicanos in the United States. It has also developed strong ties with Mexican national identity movements and Chicano nationalism. Sanchez's Native Mexican Church (which is a confederation of calpullis) was officially recognized by the government of Mexico in 2007.

Mesoamerica
Two of the most widely known examples of faith of the Indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica are the Aztec and Maya state religions sponsored the monism of the upper classes.

South America
Religious traditions of the Indigenous peoples of South America from different regions are very varied. The most outstanding contrast appears between the highly developed Andean faiths with priesthood and empire-ruling cults and the religious beliefs of the tribes in the eastern lowlands. Caral–Supe civilization in Peru has been recognized as one of the cradles of civilization and oldest-known civilization in the Americas.

An example of modern syncretistic events is the dance and parade Diablada (""Dance of the Devils"") which traditionally honored the indigenous Uru terrible god Tiw.

Pan-Native traditions and ceremonies
Especially among native North Americans, can be found several pan-Native ceremonies and traditions, both all-North American, such as powwow meetings, and regional, like the Sun Dance.

Native American Church
The Peyote Religion (legally termed and more properly known as the Native American Church), also sometimes called the ""Peyote Road"" or the ""Peyote Way"", is a reformed religious tradition involving the ceremonial and sacred use of Lophophora williamsii (peyote). Use of peyote for religious purposes is thousands of years old and some have thought it to have originated within one of the following tribes: the Carrizo, the Coahuiltecan, the Lipan Apache, the Mescalero Apache, the Karankawa, or the Caddo, the Navajo, the Tonkawa, with the Plains Cree, Carrizo, and the Lipan Apache being the three most likely sources. In Mexico the Huichol, Tepehuán, and other Native Mexicans use peyote.

Sun Dance
The Sun Dance is a religious ceremony and reform movement, 1890 the Shoshone tribe in origin, practiced by a number of Native American peoples in the U.S. and Canada, primarily those of the Plains Nations. Each tribe that has some type of sun dance ceremony that has their own distinct practices and ceremonial protocols. In many cases, the ceremony is held in private and is not open to the public. Most details of the ceremony are kept from public knowledge out of great respect for, and the desire for protection of, the traditional ways. Many of the ceremonies have features in common, such as specific dances and songs, the use of drums, the ceremonial pipe, praying, fasting and, in some cases, the piercing of the skin as a sacrifice.
In Canada, the Plains Cree call this ceremony the Thirst Dance; the Saulteaux call it the Rain Dance; and the Blackfoot (Siksika, Kainai, and Piikani) call it the Medicine Dance. It is also practiced by the Canadian Dakota and Nakoda, and the Dene.

Stomp Dance
Green Corn Ceremony
The Green Corn Ceremony is an annual ceremony practiced among various Native American peoples associated with the beginning of the yearly corn harvest.

Religious leaders
Leaders in Native religions include Popé, who led the Pueblo revolt in 1675, Quautlatas, who inspired the Tepehuan Revolt against the Spanish in 1616, Neolin, Tenskwatawa, Kenekuk, Smohalla, John Slocum, Wovoka, Black Elk and many others.

From time to time important religious leaders organized revivals. In Indiana in 1805, Tenskwatawa (called the Shawnee Prophet by Americans) led a religious revival following a smallpox epidemic and a series of witch-hunts. His beliefs were based on the earlier teachings of the Lenape prophets, Scattamek and Neolin, who predicted a coming apocalypse that would destroy the European-American settlers. Tenskwatawa urged the tribes to reject the ways of the Americans: to give up firearms, liquor, American style clothing, to pay traders only half the value of their debts, and to refrain from ceding any more lands to the United States. The revival led to warfare led by his brother Tecumseh against the white settlers. Juan de la Cruz Puc became seen as a prophet between the Yucatec Maya during the Caste War. Juan's sermons and prophecies were preserved in the A'almaj T'aan (Cruzo'ob Bible) and are still relevant between the Yucatec Maya people.

Congressional legislation
American Indian Religious Freedom Act
The American Indian Religious Freedom Act is a United States federal law and a joint resolution of Congress that provides protection for tribal culture and traditional religious rights such as access to sacred sites, freedom to worship through traditional ceremony, and use and possession of sacred objects for Native Americans, Inuit, Aleut, and Native Hawaiians. It was passed on August 11, 1978.

Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act
The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), Pub.L. 101–601, 104 Stat. 3048, is a United States federal law passed on 16 November 1990 requiring federal agencies and institutions that receive federal funding to return Native American cultural items and human remains to their respective peoples. Cultural items include funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony.

Religious Freedom Restoration Act
The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (also known as RFRA), is a 1993 United States federal law aimed at preventing laws that substantially burden a person's free exercise of religion. It was held unconstitutional as applied to the states in the City of Boerne v. Flores decision in 1997, which ruled that the RFRA is not a proper exercise of Congress's enforcement power. However, it continues to be applied to the federal government – for instance, in Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal – because Congress has broad authority to carve out exemptions from federal laws and regulations that it itself has authorized. In response to City of Boerne v. Flores, some individual states passed State Religious Freedom Restoration Acts that apply to state governments and local municipalities.

Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly during its 61st session at UN Headquarters in New York City on 13 September 2007. Article 31, in particular, emphasizes that Indigenous Peoples have the right to their cultural heritage, including ceremonial knowledge, as protected intellectual property.

Sacred sites
The Native Sacred sites could be described as ""specific, discrete, narrowly delineated location on Federal land that is identified by an Indian tribe, or Indian individual determined to be an appropriately authoritative representative of an Indian religion, as sacred by virtue of its established religious significance to, or ceremonial use by, an Indian religion"".

Among non-Natives
Among non-American Native modern pagans in a number of countries, there is a loosely formed movement called Indianism or Powwow. If in American countries, non-Natives by origin can somehow join authentic ceremonies and, at least, can revitalize same components in their own traditions, then in other parts of the world, such as Russia, neo-pagans are uniting into their own new religious movement. Its adherents, based on romanticized ideas drawn from classic adventure literature and other sources, strive to follow the worldview and way of life of American Natives. Each participant personally chooses a favorite tribe, takes a new spiritual name, and rallies (powwow) are organized in summer country camps.
In addition, there is Neoshamanism, a broad universalist new religious movement, which based on some practices derived from Native American shamanisms and associated with teachings and organisations of Carlos Castaneda and Michael Harner in the U.S. and Mestre Irineu and Mestre Gabriel in Brazil.

Terminology
Definition
There is ""considerable disagreement as to the precise definition and the proper usage"" of the term modern paganism. Even within the academic field of pagan studies, there is no consensus about how contemporary paganism can best be defined. Most scholars describe modern paganism as a broad array of different religions, not a single one. The category of modern paganism could be compared to the categories of Abrahamic religions and Indian religions in its structure. A second, less common definition found within pagan studies – promoted by the religious studies scholars Michael F. Strmiska and Graham Harvey – characterises modern paganism as a single religion, of which groups like Wicca, Druidry, and Heathenry are denominations. This perspective has been critiqued, given the lack of core commonalities in issues such as theology, cosmology, ethics, afterlife, holy days, or ritual practices within the pagan movement.
Contemporary paganism has been defined as ""a collection of modern religious, spiritual, and magical traditions that are self-consciously inspired by the pre-Judaic, pre-Christian, and pre-Islamic belief systems of Europe, North Africa, and the Near East."" Thus it has been said that although it is ""a highly diverse phenomenon"", ""an identifiable common element"" nevertheless runs through the pagan movement. Strmiska described paganism as a movement ""dedicated to reviving the polytheistic, nature-worshipping pagan religions of pre-Christian Europe and adapting them for the use of people in modern societies."" The religious studies scholar Wouter Hanegraaff characterised paganism as encompassing ""all those modern movements which are, first, based on the conviction that what Christianity has traditionally denounced as idolatry and superstition actually represents/represented a profound and meaningful religious worldview and, secondly, that a religious practice based on this worldview can and should be revitalized in our modern world.""
Discussing the relationship between the different pagan religions, religious studies scholars Kaarina Aitamurto and Scott Simpson wrote that they were ""like siblings who have taken different paths in life but still retain many visible similarities"". But there has been much ""cross-fertilization"" between these different faiths: many groups have influenced, and been influenced by, other pagan religions, making clear-cut distinctions among them more difficult for scholars to make. The various pagan religions have been academically classified as new religious movements, with the anthropologist Kathryn Rountree describing paganism as a whole as a ""new religious phenomenon"". A number of academics, particularly in North America, consider modern paganism a form of nature religion.

Some practitioners completely eschew the use of the term pagan, preferring to use more specific names for their religion, such as ""Heathen"" or ""Wiccan"". This is because the term pagan originates in Christian terminology, which individuals who object to the term wish to avoid. Some favor the term ""ethnic religion""; the World Pagan Congress, founded in 1998, soon renamed itself the European Congress of Ethnic Religions (ECER), enjoying that term's association with the Greek ethnos and the academic field of ethnology. Within linguistically Slavic areas of Europe, the term ""Native Faith"" is often favored as a synonym for paganism, rendered as Ridnovirstvo in Ukrainian, Rodnoverie in Russian, and Rodzimowierstwo in Polish. Alternately, many practitioners in these regions view ""Native Faith"" as a category within modern paganism that does not encompass all pagan religions. Other terms some pagans favor include ""traditional religion"", ""indigenous religion"", ""nativist religion"", and ""reconstructionism"".
Various pagans who are active in pagan studies, such as Michael York and Prudence Jones, have argued that, due to the similarities of their worldviews, the modern pagan movement can be treated as part of the same global phenomenon as pre-Christian Ancient religions, living Indigenous religions, and world religions like Hinduism, Shinto, and Afro-American religions. They have also suggested that these could all be included under the rubric of ""paganism"". This approach has been received critically by many specialists in religious studies. Critics have pointed out that such claims would cause problems for analytic scholarship by lumping together belief systems with very significant differences, and that the term would serve modern pagan interests by making the movement appear far larger on the world stage. Doyle White writes that modern religions that draw upon the pre-Christian belief systems of other parts of the world, such as Sub-Saharan Africa or the Americas, cannot be seen as part of the contemporary pagan movement, which is ""fundamentally Eurocentric"". Similarly, Strmiska stresses that modern paganism should not be conflated with the belief systems of the world's Indigenous peoples because the latter lived under colonialism and its legacy, and that while some pagan worldviews bear similarities to those of indigenous communities, they stem from ""different cultural, linguistic, and historical backgrounds"".

Reappropriation of ""paganism""
Many scholars have favored the use of ""neopaganism"" to describe this phenomenon, with the prefix ""neo-"" serving to distinguish the modern religions from their ancient, pre-Christian forerunners. Some pagan practitioners also prefer ""neopaganism"", believing that the prefix conveys the reformed nature of the religion, such as its rejection of practices such as animal sacrifice. Conversely, most pagans do not use the word neopagan, with some expressing disapproval of it, arguing that the term ""neo"" offensively disconnects them from what they perceive as their pre-Christian forebears. To avoid causing offense, many scholars in the English-speaking world have begun using the prefixes ""modern"" or ""contemporary"" rather than ""neo"". Several pagan studies scholars, such as Ronald Hutton and Sabina Magliocco, have emphasized the use of the upper-case ""Paganism"" to distinguish the modern movement from the lower-case ""paganism"", a term commonly used for pre-Christian belief systems. In 2015, Rountree opined that this lower case/upper case division was ""now [the] convention"" in pagan studies. Among the critics of the upper-case P are York and Andras Corban-Arthen, president of the ECER. Capitalizing the word, they argue, makes ""Paganism"" appear as the name of a cohesive religion rather than a generic religious category, and comes off as naive, dishonest or as an unwelcome attempt to disrupt the spontaneity and vernacular quality of the movement.

The term ""neo-pagan"" was coined in the 19th century in reference to Renaissance and Romanticist Hellenophile classical revivalism. By the mid-1930s ""neopagan"" was being applied to new religious movements like Jakob Wilhelm Hauer's German Faith Movement and Jan Stachniuk's Polish Zadruga, usually by outsiders and often pejoratively. Pagan as a self-designation appeared in 1964 and 1965, in the publications of the Witchcraft Research Association; at that time, the term was in use by Wiccans in the United States and the United Kingdom, but unconnected to the broader, counterculture pagan movement. The modern popularisation of the terms pagan and neopagan as they are currently understood is largely traced to Oberon Zell-Ravenheart, co-founder of the 1st Neo-Pagan Church of All Worlds who, beginning in 1967 with the early issues of Green Egg, used both terms for the growing movement. This usage has been common since the pagan revival in the 1970s.
According to Strmiska, the reappropriation of the term ""pagan"" by modern pagans served as ""a deliberate act of defiance"" against ""traditional, Christian-dominated society"", allowing them to use it as a source of ""pride and power"". In this, he compared it to the gay liberation movement's reappropriation of the term ""queer"", which had formerly been used only as a term of homophobic abuse. He suggests that part of the term's appeal lay in the fact that a large proportion of pagan converts were raised in Christian families, and that by embracing the term ""pagan"", a word long used for what was ""rejected and reviled by Christian authorities"", a convert summarizes ""in a single word his or her definitive break"" from Christianity. He further suggests that the term gained appeal through its depiction in romanticist and 19th-century European nationalist literature, where it had been imbued with ""a certain mystery and allure"", and that by embracing the word ""pagan"" modern pagans defy past religious intolerance to honor the pre-Christian peoples of Europe and emphasize those societies' cultural and artistic achievements.

Varieties
Eclectic and reconstructive
Modern pagan attitudes differ regarding the source material surrounding pre-Christian belief systems. Strmiska notes that pagan groups can be ""divided along a continuum: at one end are those that aim to reconstruct the ancient religious traditions of a particular ethnic group or a linguistic or geographic area to the highest degree possible; at the other end are those that freely blend traditions of different areas, peoples, and time periods."" Strmiska argues that these two poles could be termed reconstructionism and eclecticism, respectively. Reconstructionists do not altogether reject innovation in their interpretation and adaptation of the source material, however they do believe that the source material conveys greater authenticity and thus should be emphasized. They often follow scholarly debates about the nature of such pre-Christian religions, and some reconstructionists are themselves scholars. Eclectic pagans, conversely, seek general inspiration from the pre-Christian past, and do not attempt to recreate past rites or traditions with specific attention to detail.
On the reconstructionist side can be placed those movements which often favour the designation ""Native Faith"", including Romuva, Heathenry, Roman Traditionalism and Hellenism. On the eclectic side has been placed Wicca, Thelema, Adonism, Druidry, the Goddess Movement, Discordianism and the Radical Faeries.
Strmiska also suggests that this division could be seen as being based on ""discourses of identity"", with reconstructionists emphasizing a deep-rooted sense of place and people, and eclectics embracing a universality and openness toward humanity and the Earth.
Strmiska nevertheless notes that this reconstructionist-eclectic division is ""neither as absolute nor as straightforward as it might appear"". He cites the example of Dievturība, a form of reconstructionist paganism that seeks to revive the pre-Christian religion of the Latvian people, by noting that it exhibits eclectic tendencies by adopting a monotheistic focus and ceremonial structure from Lutheranism. Similarly, while examining neo-shamanism among the Sami people of Northern Scandinavia, Siv Ellen Kraft highlights that despite the religion being reconstructionist in intent, it is highly eclectic in the manner in which it has adopted elements from shamanic traditions in other parts of the world.
In discussing Asatro – a form of Heathenry based in Denmark – Matthew Amster notes that it did not fit clearly within such a framework, because while seeking a reconstructionist form of historical accuracy, Asatro strongly eschewed the emphasis on ethnicity that is common to other reconstructionist groups. While Wicca is identified as an eclectic form of paganism, Strmiska also notes that some Wiccans have moved in a more reconstructionist direction by focusing on a particular ethnic and cultural link, thus developing such variants as Norse Wicca and Celtic Wicca. Concern has also been expressed regarding the utility of the term ""reconstructionism"" when dealing with paganisms in Central and Eastern Europe, because in many of the languages of these regions, equivalents of the term ""reconstructionism"" – such as the Czech Historická rekonstrukce and Lithuanian Istorinė rekonstrukcija – are already used to define the secular hobby of historical re-enactment.

Ecologic and secular
The spectrum of modern paganism includes a range of ecologic and explicitly ecocentric practices, which may overlap with scientific pantheism. Pagans may distinguish their beliefs and practices as a form of religious naturalism or naturalist philosophy, with some engaged as humanistic or atheopagans.

Ethnic and regional
For some pagan groups, ethnicity is central to their religion, and some restrict membership to a single ethnic group. Some critics have described this approach as a form of racism. Other pagan groups allow people of any ethnicity, on the view that the gods and goddesses of a particular region can call anyone to their form of worship. Some such groups feel a particular affinity for the pre-Christian belief systems of a particular region with which they have no ethnic link because they see themselves as reincarnations of people from that society. There is greater focus on ethnicity within the pagan movements in continental Europe than within the pagan movements in North America and the British Isles. Such ethnic paganisms have variously been seen as responses to concerns about foreign ideologies, globalization, cosmopolitanism, and anxieties about cultural erosion.
Although they acknowledged that it was ""a highly simplified model"", Aitamurto and Simpson wrote that there was ""some truth"" to the claim that leftist-oriented forms of paganism were prevalent in North America and the British Isles while rightist-oriented forms of paganism were prevalent in Central and Eastern Europe. They noted that in these latter regions, pagan groups placed an emphasis on ""the centrality of the nation, the ethnic group, or the tribe"". Rountree wrote that it was wrong to assume that ""expressions of Paganism can be categorized straight-forwardly according to region"", but acknowledged that some regional trends were visible, such as the impact of Catholicism on paganism in Southern Europe.

Historicity
Although inspired by the pre-Christian belief systems of the past, modern paganism is not the same phenomenon as these lost traditions and in many respects differs from them considerably. Strmiska stresses that modern paganism is a ""new"", ""modern"" religious movement, even if some of its content derives from ancient sources. Contemporary paganism as practiced in the United States in the 1990s has been described as ""a synthesis of historical inspiration and present-day creativity"".
Eclectic paganism takes an undogmatic religious stance and therefore potentially sees no one as having authority to deem a source apocryphal. Contemporary paganism has therefore been prone to fakelore, especially in recent years as information and misinformation alike have been spread on the Internet and in print media. A number of Wiccan, pagan and even some Traditionalist or Tribalist groups have a history of Grandmother Stories – typically involving initiation by a Grandmother, Grandfather, or other elderly relative who is said to have instructed them in the secret, millennia-old traditions of their ancestors. As this secret wisdom can almost always be traced to recent sources, tellers of these stories have often later admitted they made them up. Strmiska asserts that contemporary paganism could be viewed as a part of the ""much larger phenomenon"" of efforts to revive ""traditional, indigenous, or native religions"" that were occurring across the globe.

Beliefs
Beliefs and practices vary widely among different pagan groups; however, there are a series of core principles common to most, if not all, forms of modern paganism. The English academic Graham Harvey noted that pagans ""rarely indulge in theology"".

Polytheism
One principle of the pagan movement is polytheism, the belief in and veneration of multiple gods or goddesses.
Within the pagan movement, there can be found many deities, both male and female, who have various associations and embody forces of nature, aspects of culture, and facets of human psychology. These deities are typically depicted in human form, and are viewed as having human faults. They are therefore not seen as perfect, but rather are venerated as being wise and powerful. Pagans feel that this understanding of the gods reflected the dynamics of life on Earth, allowing for the expression of humour.
One view in the pagan community is that these polytheistic deities are not viewed as literal entities, but as Jungian archetypes or other psychological constructs that exist in the human psyche. Others adopt the belief that the deities have both a psychological and external existence. Many pagans believe adoption of a polytheistic world-view would be beneficial for western society – replacing the dominant monotheism they see as innately repressive. In fact, many American modern pagans first came to their adopted faiths because it allowed a greater freedom, diversity, and tolerance of worship among the community. This pluralistic perspective has helped the varied factions of modern paganism exist in relative harmony. Most pagans adopt an ethos of ""unity in diversity"" regarding their religious beliefs.
The inclusion of female deities is one facet that distinguishes pagan religions from most of their Abrahamic counterparts.
In Wicca, male and female deities are typically balanced out in a form of duotheism. Among many pagans, there is a strong desire to incorporate the female aspects of the divine in their worship and within their lives, which can partially explain the attitude which sometimes manifests as the veneration of women.
There are exceptions to polytheism in paganism, as seen for instance in the form of Ukrainian paganism promoted by Lev Sylenko, which is devoted to a monotheistic veneration of the god Dazhbog.  As noted above, pagans with naturalistic worldviews may not believe in or work with deities at all.
Pagan religions commonly exhibit a metaphysical concept of an underlying order that pervades the universe, such as the concept of harmonia embraced by Hellenists and that of Wyrd found in Heathenry.

Animism and pantheism
A key part of most pagan worldviews is the holistic concept of a universe that is interconnected. This is connected with a belief in either pantheism or panentheism. In both beliefs, divinity and the material or spiritual universe are one. For pagans, pantheism means that ""divinity is inseparable from nature and that deity is immanent in nature"".
Dennis D. Carpenter noted that the belief in a pantheistic or panentheistic deity has led to the idea of interconnectedness playing a key part in pagans' worldviews. The prominent Reclaiming priestess Starhawk related that a core part of goddess-centred pagan witchcraft was ""the understanding that all being is interrelated, that we are all linked with the cosmos as parts of one living organism. What affects one of us affects us all.""
Another pivotal belief in the contemporary pagan movement is that of animism. This has been interpreted in two distinct ways among the pagan community. First, it can refer to a belief that everything in the universe is imbued with a life force or spiritual energy. In contrast, some contemporary pagans believe that there are specific spirits that inhabit various features in the natural world, and that these can be actively communicated with. Some pagans have reported experiencing communication with spirits dwelling in rocks, plants, trees and animals, as well as power animals or animal spirits who can act as spiritual helpers or guides.
Animism was also a concept common to many pre-Christian European religions, and in adopting it, contemporary pagans are attempting to ""reenter the primeval worldview"" and participate in a view of cosmology ""that is not possible for most Westerners after childhood.""

Nature veneration
All pagan movements place great emphasis on the divinity of nature as a primary source of divine will, and on humanity's membership of the natural world, bound in kinship to all life and the Earth itself. The animistic aspects of pagan theology assert that all things have a soul – not just humans or organic life – so this bond is held with mountains and rivers as well as trees and wild animals. As a result, pagans believe the essence of their spirituality is both ancient and timeless, regardless of the age of specific religious movements. Places of natural beauty are therefore treated as sacred and ideal for ritual, like the nemetons of the ancient Celts.
Many pagans hold that different lands and/or cultures have their own natural religion, with many legitimate interpretations of divinity, and therefore reject religious exclusivism.
While the pagan community has tremendous variety in political views spanning the whole of the political spectrum, environmentalism is often a common feature.

Such views have also led many pagans to revere the planet Earth as Mother Earth, who is often referred to as Gaia after the ancient Greek goddess of the Earth.

Practices
Ritual
Pagan ritual can take place in both a public and private setting.
Contemporary pagan ritual is typically geared towards ""facilitating altered states of awareness or shifting mind-sets"". To induce such altered states of consciousness, pagans use such elements as drumming, visualization, chanting, singing, dancing, and meditation. American folklorist Sabina Magliocco came to the conclusion, based upon her ethnographic fieldwork in California that certain pagan beliefs ""arise from what they experience during religious ecstasy"".
Sociologist Margot Adler highlighted how several pagan groups, like the Reformed Druids of North America and the Erisian movement incorporate a great deal of play in their rituals rather than having them be completely serious and somber. She noted that there are those who would argue that ""the Pagan community is one of the only spiritual communities that is exploring humor, joy, abandonment, even silliness and outrageousness as valid parts of spiritual experience"".
Domestic worship typically takes place in the home and is carried out by either an individual or family group. It typically involves offerings – including bread, cake, flowers, fruit, milk, beer, or wine – being given to images of deities, often accompanied with prayers and songs and the lighting of candles and incense.
Common pagan devotional practices have thus been compared to similar practices in Hinduism, Buddhism, Shinto, Roman Catholicism, and Orthodox Christianity, but contrasted with that in Protestantism, Judaism, and Islam.
Although animal sacrifice was a common part of pre-Christian ritual in Europe, it is rarely practiced in contemporary paganism.

Festival
Paganism's public rituals are generally calendrical, although the pre-Christian festivals that pagans use as a basis varied across Europe. Nevertheless, common to almost all pagan religions is an emphasis on an agricultural cycle and respect for the dead. Common pagan festivals include those marking the summer solstice and winter solstice as well as the start of spring and the harvest. In Wicca and Druidry, a Wheel of the Year has been developed which typically involves eight seasonal festivals.

Magic
The belief in magical rituals and spells is held by a ""significant number"" of contemporary pagans. Among those who believe in it, there are a variety of different views about what magic is. Many modern pagans adhere to the definition of magic provided by Aleister Crowley, the founder of Thelema: ""the Science and Art of causing change to occur in conformity with Will"". Also accepted by many is the related definition purportedly provided by the ceremonial magician Dion Fortune: ""magic is the art and science of changing consciousness according to the Will"".
Among those who practice magic are Wiccans, those who identify as neopagan witches, and practitioners of some forms of revivalist neo-Druidism, the rituals of which are at least partially based upon those of ceremonial magic and freemasonry.

History
Early modern period
Discussions about prevailing, returning or new forms of paganism have existed throughout the modern period. Before the 20th century, Christian institutions regularly used paganism as a term for everything outside of Christianity, Judaism and – from the 18th century – Islam. They frequently associated paganism with idolatry, magic and a general concept of ""false religion"", which for example has made Catholics and Protestants accuse each other of being pagans. Various folk beliefs have periodically been labeled as pagan and churches have demanded that they should be purged. The Western attitude to paganism gradually changed during the early modern period. One reason was increased contacts with areas outside of Europe, which happened through trade, Christian mission and colonization. Increased knowledge of other cultures led to questions of whether their practices even fit into the definitions of religion, and paganism was incorporated in the idea of progress, where it was ranked as a low, undeveloped form of religion. Another reason for change was the circulation of ancient writings such as those attributed to Hermes Trismegistus; this made paganism an intellectual position some Europeans began to self-identify with, starting at the latest in the 15th century with people like Gemistus Pletho, who wanted to establish a new form of Greco-Roman polytheism.
Gemistus Pletho influenced Cosimo de Medici to establish the Florentine Neoplatonic Academy and consequentially Julius Pomponius Laetus (student of Pletho) also advocated for a revival and established the Roman academy which secretly celebrated the Natale di Roma and the birthday of Romulus. The Academy was dissolved in 1468 when Pope Paul II  ordered the arrest and execution of some of the members, Pope Sixtus IV allowed Laetus to open the academy again until the Sack of Rome of the 1527.
Positive identification with paganism became more common in the 18th and 19th centuries, when it tied in with criticism of Christianity and organized religion, rooted in the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment and Romanticism. The approach to paganism varied during this period; Friedrich Schiller's 1788 poem ""Die Götter Griechenlandes"" presents ancient Greek religion as a powerful alternative to Christianity, whereas others took interest in paganism through the concept of the noble savage, often associated with Jean-Jacques Rousseau. During the French Revolution and First French Republic, some public figures incorporated pagan themes in their worldviews. An explicit example was Gabriel André Aucler, who responded to both Christianity and Enlightenment atheism by performing pagan rites and arguing for renewed pagan religiosity in his book La Thréicie (1799).

19th and early 20th centuries
One of the origins of modern pagan movements lies in the romanticist and national liberation movements that developed in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries. The publications of studies into European folk customs and culture by scholars like Johann Gottfried Herder and Jacob Grimm resulted in a wider interest in these subjects and a growth in cultural self-consciousness. At the time, it was commonly believed that almost all such folk customs were survivals from the pre-Christian period. These attitudes would also be exported to North America by European immigrants in these centuries.
The Romantic movement of the 18th century led to the re-discovery of Old Gaelic and Old Norse literature and poetry. The 19th century saw a surge of interest in Germanic paganism with the Viking revival in Victorian Britain and Scandinavia, and the Völkisch movement in Germany. These currents coincided with Romanticist interest in folklore and occultism, the widespread emergence of pagan themes in popular literature, and the rise of nationalism.

The rise of modern paganism was aided by the decline in Christianity throughout many parts of Europe and North America, as well as by the concomitant decline in enforced religious conformity and greater freedom of religion that developed, allowing people to explore a wider range of spiritual options and form religious organisations that could operate free from legal persecution.
Historian Ronald Hutton has argued that many of the motifs of 20th century neo-paganism may be traced back to the utopian, mystical counter-cultures of the late-Victorian and Edwardian periods (also extending in some instances into the 1920s), via the works of amateur folklorists, popular authors, poets, political radicals and alternative lifestylers.
Prior to the spread of the 20th-century modern pagan movements, a notable instance of self-identified paganism was in Sioux writer Zitkala-sa's essay ""Why I Am A Pagan"". Published in the Atlantic Monthly in 1902, the Native American activist and writer outlined her rejection of Christianity (referred to as ""the new superstition"") in favor of a harmony with nature embodied by the Great Spirit. She further recounted her mother's abandonment of Sioux religion and the unsuccessful attempts of a ""native preacher"" to get her to attend the village church.
In the 1920s Margaret Murray theorized that a secret pagan religion had survived the witchcraft persecutions enacted by the ecclesiastical and secular courts. Historians now reject Murray's theory, as she based it partially upon the similarities of the accounts given by those accused of witchcraft; such similarity is now thought to actually derive from there having been a standard set of questions laid out in the witch-hunting manuals used by interrogators.
In the transition between the 1800s and 1900s, efforts to incorporate pagan-Roman rituals into the Italian national identity were made by archaeologist Giacomo Boni and esoteric circles in Rome.
In 1927, philosopher and esotericist Julius Evola founded the Gruppo di Ur in Rome, along with its journal Ur (1927–1928), involving figures like Arturo Reghini. In 1928, Evola published Imperialismo Pagano, advocating Italian political paganism to oppose the Lateran Pacts. The journal resumed in 1929 as Krur.
A mysterious document published in Krur in 1929, attributed to orientalist Leone Caetani, suggested that Italy's World War I victory and the rise of fascism were influenced by Etruscan-Roman rites.

Late 20th century
The 1960s and 1970s saw a resurgence in neo-Druidism as well as the rise of modern Germanic paganism in the United States and in Iceland. In the 1970s, Wicca was notably influenced by feminism, leading to the creation of an eclectic, Goddess-worshipping movement known as Dianic Wicca. The 1979 publication of Margot Adler's Drawing Down the Moon and Starhawk's The Spiral Dance opened a new chapter in public awareness of paganism.
With the growth and spread of large, pagan gatherings and festivals in the 1980s, public varieties of Wicca continued to further diversify into additional, eclectic sub-denominations, often heavily influenced by the New Age and counter-culture movements. These open, unstructured or loosely structured traditions contrast with British Traditional Wicca, which emphasizes secrecy and initiatory lineage.
In 1998, the ECER (European Congress of Ethnic Religions) was founded with the aim of safeguarding pre-Christian or reconstructionist religions. Some of the organizations affiliated with this entity have contributed to the revival of paganism by building temples and organizing rituals and events in collaboration with various organizations.
After the fall of fascism, the public focus on pre-Christian Roman spirituality was mainly promoted by Julius Evola. In the 1970s, interest in pagan Romanity and the Gruppo di Ur resurfaced among youth linked to Evola. He also introduced non-Roman religious concepts like Buddhism, Hinduism, and sexual magic.
The Gruppo dei Dioscuri was formed in Rome, Naples, and Messina, publishing four pamphlets before disappearing from public view, though it continued activities from 1969 and remained active in various Italian regions after its founder's death in 2000.
The Evolian journal Arthos, founded in Genoa in 1972 by Renato del Ponte, expressed significant interest in Roman religion. In 1984, the Gruppo Arx revived Messina's Dioscuri activities, and the Pythagorean Association briefly resurfaced in Calabria and Sicily from 1984 to 1988, publishing Yghìeia.
Other publications include the Genoese Il Basilisco (1979–1989), which released several works on pagan studies, and Politica Romana (1994–2004), seen as a high-level Romano-pagan journal. One prominent figure was actor Roberto Corbiletto, who died in a mysterious fire in 1999.
The 1980s and 1990s also saw an increasing interest in serious academic research and reconstructionist pagan traditions. The establishment and growth of the Internet in the 1990s brought rapid growth to these, and other pagan movements. By the time of the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991, freedom of religion was legally established across Russia and a number of other newly independent states, allowing for the growth in both Christian and non-Christian religions.

Religious paths and movements
Reconstructionist
In contrast to the eclectic traditions, Polytheistic Reconstructionists practice culturally specific ethnic traditions based on folklore, songs and prayers, as well as reconstructions from the historical record. Hellenic, Roman, Kemetic, Celtic, Germanic, Guanche, Baltic and Slavic reconstructionists aim to preserve and revive the practices and beliefs of Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, Ancient Egypt, the Celts, the Germanic peoples, the Guanche people, the Balts and the Slavs, respectively.

Germanic
Heathenism, also known as Germanic neopaganism, refers to a series of contemporary pagan traditions based on the historical religions, culture and literature of Germanic-speaking Europe. Heathenry is spread out across northwestern Europe, North America and Australasia, where the descendants of historic Germanic-speaking people now live.
Many Heathen groups adopt variants of Norse mythology as a basis for their beliefs, conceiving of the Earth as on the great world tree Yggdrasil. Heathens believe in multiple polytheistic deities adopted from historical Germanic mythologies. Most are polytheistic realists, believing that the deities are real entities, while others view them as Jungian archetypes.

Celtic
Slavic
Slavic neo-paganism, or Slavic nativism, is a reconstruction of the pre-Christian pagan beliefs of the ancient Slavs, a return to the worship of Perun, Veles, Makosh, etc. based on some historical information and one's own ideas, with borrowings from the teachings and rituals of polytheistic beliefs of other peoples and the occult.

Uralic
Baltic
Greek
Roman
Kemetic
Semitic
Beit Asherah (the house of the Goddess Asherah) was one of the first modern pagan synagogues, founded in the early 1990s by Stephanie Fox, Steven Posch, and Magenta Griffiths (Lady Magenta). Magenta Griffiths is High Priestess of the Beit Asherah coven, and a former board member of the Covenant of the Goddess.

Armenian
Chuvash
The Chuvash people, a Turkic ethnic group native to an area stretching from the Volga Region to Siberia, have experienced a pagan revival since the fall of the Soviet Union. While potentially considered a peculiar form of Tengrism, a related revivalist movement of Central Asian traditional religion, Vattisen Yaly (Chuvash: Ваттисен йӑли, Tradition of the Old) differs significantly: the Chuvash being a heavily Fennicised and Slavified ethnicity and having had exchanges also with other Indo-European ethnicities, their religion shows many similarities with Finnic and Slavic paganisms; moreover, the revival of Vattisen Yaly in recent decades has occurred following modern pagan patterns. Today the followers of the Chuvash Traditional Religion are called ""the true Chuvash"". Their main god is Tura, a deity comparable to the Estonian Taara, the Germanic Thunraz and the pan-Turkic Tengri.

Eclectic
Wicca
Wicca is the largest form of modern paganism, as well as the best-known and most extensively studied.
Religious studies scholar Graham Harvey noted that the poem ""Charge of the Goddess"" remains central to the liturgy of most Wiccan groups. Originally written by Wiccan High Priestess Doreen Valiente in the mid-1950s, the poem allows Wiccans to gain wisdom and experience deity in ""the ordinary things in life.""
Historian Ronald Hutton identified a wide variety of different sources that influenced Wicca's development, including ceremonial magic, folk magic, Romanticist literature, Freemasonry, and the witch-cult theory of English archaeologist Margaret Murray. English esotericist Gerald Gardner was at the forefront of the burgeoning Wiccan movement. He claimed to have been initiated by the New Forest coven in 1939, and that the religion he discovered was a survival of the pagan witch-cult described in Murray's theory. Various forms of Wicca have since evolved or been adapted from Gardner's British Traditional Wicca or Gardnerian Wicca, such as Alexandrian Wicca. Other forms loosely based on Gardner's teachings are Faery Wicca, Kemetic Wicca, Judeo-paganism or jewitchery, and Dianic Wicca or feminist Wicca, which emphasizes the divine feminine, often creating women-only or lesbian-only groups. In the academic community Wicca has also been interpreted as having close affinities with process philosophy.
In the 1990s, Wiccan beliefs and practices were used as a partial basis for a number of US films and television series, such as The Craft, Charmed and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, leading to a surge in teenagers' and young adults' interest and involvement in the religion.

Goddess movement
Goddess spirituality, which is also known as the Goddess movement, is a pagan religion in which a singular, monotheistic Goddess is given predominance. Goddess Spirituality revolves around the sacredness of the female form, and of aspects of women's lives that adherents say have been traditionally neglected in Western society, such as menstruation, sexuality, and maternity.
The Goddess movement draws some of its inspiration from the work of archaeologists such as Marija Gimbutas, whose interpretation of artifacts excavated from ""Old Europe"" points to societies of Neolithic Europe that were matristic or goddess-centered worshipping a female deity of three primary aspects, which has inspired some modern pagan worshippers of the Triple Goddess.
Adherents of the Goddess Spirituality movement typically envision a history of the world that is different from traditional narratives about the past, emphasising the role of women rather than that of men. According to this view, human society was formerly a matriarchy, with communities being egalitarian, pacifistic, and focused on the worship of the Mother goddess, which was subsequently overthrown by violent and warlike patriarchal hordes – usually Indo-European pastoralists who worshipped male sky-gods, and continued to rule through the form of Abrahamic religions, specifically Christianity in the West. Adherents look for elements of this human history in ""theological, anthropological, archaeological, historical, folkloric and hagiographic writings.""

Druidry
Druidry shows similar heterogeneity as Wicca. It draws inspirations from historical Druids, the priest caste of the ancient pagan Celts. Druidry dates to the earliest forms of modern paganism: the Ancient Order of Druids founded in 1781 had many aspects of freemasonry, and has practiced rituals at Stonehenge since 1905. George Watson MacGregor Reid founded the Druid Order in its current form in 1909. In 1964 Ross Nichols established the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids. In the United States, the Ancient Order of Druids in America (AODA) was established in 1912, the Reformed Druids of North America (RDNA) in 1963, and Ár nDraíocht Féin (ADF) in 1983 by Isaac Bonewits.

Eco-paganism and Unitarian Universalism
Eco-paganism and Eco-magic, which are offshoots of direct action environmental groups, strongly emphasize fairy imagery and a belief in the possibility of intercession by the fae (fairies, pixies, gnomes, elves, and other spirits of nature and the Otherworlds).
Some Unitarian Universalists are eclectic pagans. Unitarian Universalists look for spiritual inspiration in a wide variety of religious beliefs. The Covenant of Unitarian Universalist Pagans, or CUUPs, encourages its chapters to ""use practices familiar to members who attend for worship services but not to follow only one tradition of paganism.""

Occultism and ethnic mysticism
In 1925, the Czech esotericist Franz Sättler founded the pagan religion Adonism, devoted to the ancient Greek god Adonis, whom Sättler equated with the Christian Satan, and which purported that the end of the world would come in 2000. Adonism largely died out in the 1930s, but remained an influence on the German occult scene.

Demographics
Establishing precise figures on paganism is difficult. Due to the secrecy and fear of persecution still prevalent among pagans, limited numbers are willing to openly be counted. The decentralised nature of paganism and sheer number of solitary practitioners further complicates matters. Nevertheless, there is a slow growing body of data on the subject. In the US, there are estimated to be between 1 and 1.5 million practitioners.

Europe
Caucasus region
Among Circassians, the Adyghe Habze faith has been revived after the fall of the Soviet Union, and followers of modern pagan faiths were found to constitute 12% in Karachay-Cherkessia and 3% in Kabardino-Balkaria (both republics are multiethnic and also have many non-Circassians, especially Russians and Turkic peoples) In Abkhazia, the Abkhaz native faith has also been revived, and in the 2003 census, 8% of residents identified with it (note again that there are many non-Abkhaz in the state including Georgians, Russians and Armenians); on 3 August 2012 the Council of Priests of Abkhazia was formally constituted in Sukhumi. In North Ossetia, the Uatsdin faith was revived, and in 2012, 29% of the population identified with it (North Ossetia is about 2/3 Ossetian and 1/3 Russian). Modern pagan movements are also present to a lesser degree elsewhere; in Dagestan 2% of the population identified with folk religious movements, while data on modern pagans is unavailable for Chechnya and Ingushetia.

Volga region
The Mari native religion in fact has a continuous existence, but it has co-existed with Orthodox Christianity for centuries and experienced a renewal after the fall of the Soviet Union. A sociological survey conducted in 2004 found that about 15 percent of the population of Mari El consider themselves adherents of the Mari native religion. Since Mari make up just 45 percent of the republic's population of 700,000, this figure means that probably more than a third claim to follow the old religion. The percentage of pagans among the Mari of Bashkortostan and the eastern part of Tatarstan is even higher (up to 69% among women). Mari fled here from forced Christianization in the 17th to 19th centuries. A similar number was claimed by Victor Schnirelmann, for whom between a quarter and a half of the Mari either worship the pagan gods or are members of modern pagan groups.
A modern pagan movement drawing from various syncretic practices that had survived among the Christianised Mari people was initiated in 1990 that was estimated in 2004 to have won the adherence of 2% of the Mordvin people.

Western Europe
A study by Ronald Hutton compared a number of different sources (including membership lists of major UK organizations, attendance at major events, subscriptions to magazines, etc.) and used standard models for extrapolating likely numbers. This estimate accounted for multiple membership overlaps, as well as the number of adherents represented by each attendee of a pagan gathering. Hutton estimated that there are 250,000 modern pagans in the United Kingdom, roughly equivalent to the national Hindu community.
A smaller number is suggested by the results of the 2001 Census, in which a question about religious affiliation was asked for the first time. Respondents were able to write in an affiliation not covered by the checklist of common religions, and a total of 42,262 people from England, Scotland and Wales declared themselves to be pagans by this method. These figures were not released as a matter of course by the Office for National Statistics but were released after an application by the Pagan Federation of Scotland. This is more than many well known traditions such as Rastafarian, Baháʼí and Zoroastrian groups but fewer than the big six of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism and Buddhism. It is also fewer than the adherents of Jediism, whose campaign made their faith the fourth largest religion after Christianity, Islam and Hinduism.

The 2001 UK Census figures did not allow an accurate breakdown of traditions within the pagan heading, as a campaign by the Pagan Federation before the census encouraged Wiccans, Heathens, Druids and others all to use the same write-in term 'pagan' to maximise the numbers reported. However, the 2011 census made it possible to describe oneself as pagan-Wiccan, pagan-Druid and so on. The figures for England and Wales showed 80,153 describing themselves as pagan (or some subgroup thereof). The largest subgroup was Wicca, with 11,766 adherents. The overall numbers of people self-reporting as pagan rose between 2001 and 2011. In 2001, about seven people per 10,000 UK respondents were pagan; in 2011, the number (based on the England and Wales population) was 14.3 people per 10,000 respondents.
Census figures in Ireland do not provide a breakdown of religions outside of the major Christian denominations and other major world religions. A total of 22,497 people stated Other Religion in the 2006 census; and a rough estimate is that there were 2,000–3,000 practicing pagans in Ireland in 2009. Numerous pagan groups – primarily Wiccan and Druidic – exist in Ireland though none is officially recognised by the Government. Irish paganism is often strongly concerned with issues of place and language.

North America
Canada does not provide extremely detailed records of religious adherence. Its statistics service only collects limited religious information each decade. At the 2001 census, there were a recorded 21,080 pagans in Canada.
The United States government does not directly collect religious information. As a result such information is provided by religious institutions and other third-party statistical organisations. Based on the most recent survey by the Pew Research Center, there are approximately one million pagans in the United States. 0.3% of respondents answered ""Pagan"" or ""Wiccan"" when polled.
According to Helen A. Berger's 1995 survey ""The Pagan Census"", most American pagans are middle-class, educated, and live in urban/suburban areas on the East and West coasts.

Oceania
In the 2011 Australian Census, 32,083 respondents identified as pagan. Out of 21,507,717 recorded Australians, they compose approximately 0.15% of the population. The Australian Bureau of Statistics classifies paganism as an affiliation under which several sub-classifications may optionally be specified. This includes animism, nature religion, Druidism, pantheism, and Wicca/Witchcraft. As a result, fairly detailed breakdowns of pagan respondents are available.

In 2006, there were at least 6,804 (0.164%) pagans among New Zealand's population of approximately 4 million. Respondents were given the option to select one or more religious affiliations.

Paganism in society
Propagation
Based upon her study of the pagan community in the United States, the sociologist Margot Adler noted that it is rare for pagan groups to proselytize to gain new converts to their faiths. Instead, she argued that ""in most cases,"" converts first become interested in the movement through ""word of mouth, a discussion between friends, a lecture, a book, an article or a Web site."" She went on to put forward the idea that this typically confirmed ""some original, private experience, so that the most common experience of those who have named themselves pagan is something like 'I finally found a group that has the same religious perceptions I always had.'"" A practicing Wiccan herself, Adler used her own conversion to paganism as a case study, remarking that as a child she had taken a great interest in the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece, and had performed her own devised rituals in dedication to them. When she eventually came across the Wiccan religion many years later, she then found that it confirmed her earlier childhood experiences, and that ""I never converted in the accepted sense. I simply accepted, reaffirmed, and extended a very old experience"".

Folklorist Sabina Magliocco supported this idea, noting that a great many of those Californian pagans whom she interviewed claimed that they had been greatly interested in mythology and folklore as children, imagining a world of ""enchanted nature and magical transformations, filled with lords and ladies, witches and wizards, and humble but often wise peasants"". Magliocco noted that it was this world that pagans ""strive to re-create in some measure"". Further support for Adler's ideas came from American Wiccan priestess Judy Harrow, who noted that among her comrades, there was a feeling that ""you don't become pagan, you discover that you always were"". They have also been supported by Pagan studies scholar Graham Harvey.
Many pagans in North America encounter the movement through their involvement in other hobbies; particularly popular with US pagans are ""golden age-type"" pastimes such as the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA), Star Trek fandom, Doctor Who fandom and comic book fandom. Other ways in which many North American pagans have gotten involved with the movement are through political or ecological activism, such as vegetarian groups, health food stores, or feminist university courses.
Adler went on to note that from those she interviewed and surveyed in the US she could identify a number of common factors that led to people getting involved in paganism: the beauty, vision and imagination that was found within their beliefs and rituals, a sense of intellectual satisfaction and personal growth that they imparted, their support for environmentalism or feminism, and a sense of freedom.

Class, gender and ethnicity
United States
Based upon her work in the United States, Adler found that the pagan movement was ""very diverse"" in its class and ethnic backgrounds. She went on to remark that she had encountered pagans in jobs that ranged from ""fireman to PhD chemist"" but that the one thing she thought made them into an ""elite"" was being avid readers, something that she found to be very common within the pagan community despite the fact that avid readers constituted less than 20% of the general population of the United States at the time. Magliocco came to a somewhat different conclusion based upon her ethnographic research of pagans in California, remarking that the majority were ""white, middle-class, well-educated urbanites"" but that they were united in finding ""artistic inspiration"" within ""folk and indigenous [American] spiritual traditions,""
The sociologist Regina Oboler examined the role of gender in the American pagan community, arguing that although the movement had been constant in its support for the equality of men and women ever since its foundation, there was still an essentialist view of gender ingrained within it, with female deities being accorded traditional western feminine traits and male deities being similarly accorded what western society saw as masculine traits.

Racism and nationalism
Generally, modern pagan currents in Western countries do not advocate nationalist or far-right ideologies. Instead, they advocate individual self-improvement and liberal values of personal freedom, gender equality, and environmental protection. The nationalist sentiments expressed by modern pagans in Western countries are marginal, so the ideas of cosmopolitanism are prevalent. Faith and dogmas give way to active practices, including psychotechnics, which was extensively influenced by neo-Hinduism. In contrast, many areas of post-Soviet modern paganism, including Russian, are occupied not so much with individual self-improvement as they are occupied with social problems, and they also create nationalist ideologies based on the ""invented past"".
Modern paganism is one of the directions in the development of romantic nationalism with its components such as the idealization of a particular people's historical or mythological past, dissatisfaction with modernity, and the ease of transition to a radical stage with the postulation of national superiority.
The ""volksgeist"", which is given great attention within the framework of ethnic nationalism, is often identified with religion, so there is a desire to create or revive one's religion or nationalize one of the world's religions. Heinrich Heine linked nationalism with paganism. The philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev, who shared Heine's opinion, noted the regularity of the tendency of the transition of German antisemitism into anti-Christianity.
At the beginning of the 20th century, the spiritual crisis in Russia led to a fascination with paganism, at first ancient and then Slavic ""native gods,"" which was especially true for the symbolists. The publicist Daniil Pasmanik (1923) wrote that consistent antisemitism should reject Judaism and Christianity. He noted that this trend had already led Germany to worship Odin and, in the future, in his opinion, would inevitably lead Russia to worship Perun.
German occultism and modern paganism arose in the early 20th century, and they became influential through teachings such as Ariosophy, gaining adherents within the far-right Völkisch movement, which eventually culminated in Nazism. The development of such ideas after World War II gave rise to Wotanism, a white nationalist modern pagan movement at the end of the 20th century.

In Germany in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Völkisch movement, characterized by a racist antisemitic ideology of radical ethnic nationalism of the dominant population, spread. The central elements of the worldview were racism and elitism. The movement included a religious modern pagan component. The ideology developed out of German nationalist romanticism. Nazism is considered one of the movements within the völkisch or as strongly influenced by the völkisch. Völkisch consisted of many religiopolitical groups whose leaders and followers were closely associated with each other and the developing Nazi Party. This ideology significantly impacted various aspects of German culture at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.
Liberalism and rationalism, which demystified the time-honored order that accepted authorities and prejudices, also caused an adverse reaction from supporters of the völkisch movement. A negative attitude towards modernity characterizes the writings of German nationalist ""prophets"" such as Paul Delagardie, Julius Lang, and Arthur Moeller van den Bruck. The movement combined a sentimental patriotic interest in German folklore and local history with anti-urban, back-to-the-earth populism. To overcome what they considered the ailment of scientific and rationalistic modernity, the authors of völkisch found a spiritual solution in the essence of the ""people,"" perceived as genuine, intuitive, even ""primitive,"" in the sense of the location of the ""people"" on the level with the original (primordial) cosmic order.
Völkisch thinkers tended to idealize the myth of the ""original nation"", which they believed could still be found in rural Germany, a form of ""primitive democracy freely subject to its natural elite"". The idea of the ""people"" (German: Volk) was subsequently transformed into the idea of ""racial essence"", and Völkisch thinkers understood this term as a life-giving and quasi-eternal essence and not as a sociological category, in the same way as they considered ""Nature"".
Modern pagan ideas were present in Ariosophy, an esoteric teaching created by the Austrian occultists Guido von List and Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels in Austria between 1890 and 1930. The term ""ariosophy"" can also be used generically to describe the ""Aryan""/esoteric teachings of the völkisch subset. The doctrine of Ariosophy was based on pseudoscientific ideas about ""Aryan"" purity and the mystical unity of spirit and body. It was influenced by the German nationalist völkisch movement, the theosophy of Helena Blavatsky, the Austrian pan-German movement, and social Darwinism and its racist conclusions. Ariosophy influenced the ideology of Nazism.
The works of the Ariosophists describe the prehistoric ""Aryan"" golden age when the wise keepers of knowledge learned and taught occult racial teachings and ruled over a ""racially pure"" society. It is alleged that there is an evil conspiracy of anti-German forces, including all ""non-Aryan"" races, Jews, and the Christian church, seeking to destroy the ideal ""Aryan"" German world by freeing the ""non-Aryan"" mob to establish a false equality of the illegitimate (representatives of ""non-Aryan"" races). History, including wars, economic crises, political uncertainty, and the weakening of the power of the German principle, is seen as the result of racial mixing.
The doctrine had followers in Austria and Germany. Occultism in the doctrines of the Ariosophists was of great importance as a sacral justification for an extreme political position and a fundamental rejection of reality, including socio-economic progress. The Ariosophists sought to predict and justify the ""coming era"" of the German world order. To counter the modern world, ""corrupted"" by racial mixing, the Ariosophists created many small circles and secret religious societies to revive the ""lost"" esoteric knowledge and racial virtues of the ancient Germans to create a new pan-German empire.
To recreate the religion of the ancient Germans, List used the Scandinavian epic and the work of contemporary theosophists, in particular Max Ferdinand Sebaldt von Werth, who described the eugenic practices of the ""Aryans"", as well as The Secret Doctrine by Helena Blavatsky and The Lost Lemuria by William Scott-Elliot. Influenced by these works, List used the terms ""Ario-Germans"" and ""race"" instead of ""Germans"" and ""people"", perhaps to emphasize the overlap with the fifth root race in Blavatsky's scheme. List and Lanz developed ideas about the struggle between the ""Aryan race of masters"" and the ""race of slaves"" and about the ancestral home of the ""Aryans"" on the sunken polar island of Arctogea.
In Nazi Germany, Germanic pagan folklore, as a source of primordial moral standards, was revered higher than Christianity associated with Judaism. Many Nazis saw anti-Christianity as a deeper form of antisemitism. Heinrich Himmler spoke of the need to create a ""neo-Germanic religion"" capable of replacing Christianity. The Old Testament was especially repugnant to the Nazis. Adolf Hitler called it ""Satan's Bible"". Rosenberg demanded that it be banned as a ""vehicle of Jewish influence"" and replaced by the Nordic sagas. The Nazi ideology combined the veneration of the ""pagan heritage of the ancestors"" with puritanical, Christian sexual morality, which the ""Nordic"" Apollo was supposed to personify.
White supremacist ideologies and neo-Nazism, including ideas of racism, antisemitism, and anti-LGBTQ, have infiltrated or assimilated many Germanic modern pagan movements such as Odinism and some Ásatrú groups, including the Asatru Folk Assembly. These groups believe that the Germanic beliefs they hold constitute the true Caucasoid ethnic religion.
The issue of race is a major source of contention among modern pagans, especially in the United States. In the modern pagan community, one view is that race is entirely a matter of biological heredity, while the opposite position is that race is a social construct rooted in cultural heritage. In US modern pagan discourse, these views are described as völkische and universalist positions, respectively. The two factions, which Jeffrey Kaplan has called the ""racist"" and ""non-racist"" camps, often clash, with Kaplan claiming that there is a ""virtual civil war"" between them within the American modern pagan community. The division into universalists and völkisch also spread to other countries, but had less impact on the more ethnically homogeneous Iceland. A 2015 survey showed that more modern pagans adhere to universalist ideas than völkisch.
Going beyond this binary classification, religious scholar Mattias Gardell divides modern paganism in the United States into three factions according to their racial stance:

the ""anti-racist"" faction, which denounces any connection between religion and racial identity
the ""radical-racist"" faction, which believes that members of other racial groups should not follow their religion because racial identity is the natural religion of the ""Aryan race""
an ""ethnic"" faction seeking to forge a middle path by recognizing their religion's roots in Northern Europe and its connection to people of Northern European origin
Religious scholar Stephanie von Schnurbein accepted Gardell's tripartite division, and referred to these groups as the ""aracist"", ""racial-religious"", and ""ethnic"" factions, respectively.
Supporters of the universalist and anti-racist approach believe that the deities of Germanic Europe can call anyone to worship them, regardless of ethnic origin. This group rejects the völkisch focus on race, believing that even unintentionally, such an approach can lead to racist attitudes towards people of non-Northern European origin. Practicing universalists such as Stephan Grundy emphasize that ancient northern Europeans married and had children with members of other ethnic groups, and in Norse mythology, the Æsir did the same with the Vanir, jötnar, and humans, so these modern pagans criticize racist views.
Universalists favorably accept practitioners of modern paganism who are not of Northern European origin; for example, The Troth, based in the United States, has Jewish and African American members, and many of its white members have spouses who belong to different racial groups. While some pagans continue to believe that Germanic paganism is an innate religion, universalists have sometimes argued that this paganism is an innate religion for the lands of Northern Europe and not for a particular race. Universalists often complain that some journalists portray modern paganism as an inherently racist movement, so they use the Internet to highlight their opposition to far-right politics.
In Heathenry, the terms ""völkisch"", ""neo-völkisch"", or the Anglicised ""folkish"" are used both as endonyms and exonyms for groups who believe that the religion is closely related to the claimed biological race. Völkisch practitioners consider paganism to be an indigenous religion of a biologically distinct race that is conceptualized as ""White"", ""Nordic"", ""Aryan"", ""Northern European"", or ""English"". Völkisch modern pagans generally regard these classifications as self-evident, despite the academic consensus that race is a cultural construct.
Völkisch groups often use ethnonationalist language and claim that only members of these racial groups are entitled to practice a given religion, taking the pseudoscientific view that ""gods and goddesses are encoded in the DNA"" of the members of a race. Some practitioners explain the idea of linking their race and religion by saying that religion is inextricably linked to the collective unconscious of that race. The American modern pagan Stephen McNallen developed these ideas into a concept he called ""metagenetics"". McNallen and many other members of the modern pagan ""ethnic"" faction explicitly state that they are not racist, although Gardell has noted that their views may be considered racist under specific definitions of the term. Gardell considered many ""ethnic"" modern pagans to be ethnic nationalists.
Many völkisch practitioners disapprove of multiculturalism and racial mixing in modern Europe, advocating racial separatism. In online media, modern pagan völkische often express a belief in the threat of racial miscegenation, which they blame on the social and political establishment, sometimes claiming that their ideas of racial exclusivity are the result of the threat that other ethnic groups pose to ""white"" people. While these groups generally claim to be aiming to revive Germanic paganism, their race-centric views have their origins in 19th-century culture, not antiquity. This group's discourse contains the concepts of ""ancestors"" and ""homeland"", which are understood very vaguely. Researcher Ethan Doyle White characterizes the position of the Odinic Rite and the Odin Brotherhood as ""far right"".
Ethnocentric modern pagans are highly critical of their universalist counterparts, often claiming that the latter have been misled by New Age literature and political correctness. Members of the universalist and ethnocentric factions criticize those who adopt an ""ethnic"" stance. The former view ""ethnic"" modern paganism as a cover for racism, while the latter view its adherents as race traitors for their refusal to fully accept the superiority of the ""white race"".
Some modern pagans of the völkisch movement are white supremacists and outright racists representing a ""radical racist"" faction that uses the names Odinism, Wotanism, and Wodenism. According to Kaplan, these adepts occupy the ""most remote corners"" of modern paganism. The lines between this form of modern paganism and Nazism are ""extremely thin"" because its adherents praise Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, claim that the ""white race"" is threatened with extinction by the efforts of a Jewish world conspiracy, and dismiss Christianity as a work of the Jews.
Many in the inner circle of the terrorist organization The Order, a white supremacist militia operating in the US in the 1980s, called themselves Odinists. Various racist modern pagans supported the Fourteen Words slogan, which was developed by The Order member David Lane. Some racist organizations, such as the Order of Nine Angles and the Black Order, combine elements of modern paganism with Satanism, while other racist modern pagans, such as Wotanist Ron McVan, reject the syncretism of the two religions.
American neo-Nazi William Luther Pierce, the founder of the National Alliance, whose ideas stimulated neo-Nazi terrorism, also created the Cosmotheistic Community Church in 1978. He considered the teaching he created within the framework of this church to be pantheism and leaned towards the ""Panaryan"" Nordic cults. These cults emphasized the idea of a unique closeness of ""white people"" with nature and the natural ""spiritual essence"", which was influenced by the ideas of Savitri Devi. According to the doctrine, each race has its predestined role: ""whites"" are predisposed to strive for God, blacks strive for laziness, and Jews strive for corruption.
In 1985, Pierce purchased a large piece of land at Mill Point in West Virginia, fenced it in with barbed wire, and began selling books on Western culture and Western ""pagan traditions"" there. He aimed to save the ""white race"" away from the federal government. In part, he also drew on British Israelism and the racist religion of Identity Christianity. The ""National Alliance"" met regularly to discuss the ideas of ""cosmotheism"". Pierce dismissed Christianity as ""one of the chief mental illnesses of our people"" through which ""Jewish influence"" spreads. Pierce saw the proposed government after the ""racial revolution"" as religious, which would be ""more like a holy order."" He considered the future religion of the ""white race"" the ""Aryan religion"" – the ""cosmotheism"" that he created.
Sociologist Marlène Laruelle notes the activation of ""Aryan"" modern paganism in the West and Russia. For example, social movements are thus developing that appeal to the Celtic past and call for a return to the ""druidic religions"" of pre-Christian Europe. For the most part, the French and German Nouvelle Droite share the common idea of a pan-European unity based on an ""Aryan"" identity and the desire to part with Christianity, the period of domination of which is seen as two thousand years of ""wandering in darkness.""
Slavic neopaganism (Rodnoverie) has a close connection with Nazism, reproducing its main ideas: the ""Aryan"" idea, including the idea of the northern ancestral home (in Rodnoverie, it is in the Russian North, the Northern Urals, or beyond the Arctic Circle); the connection of their people with the ""Aryans"" or complete identification with them (in Rodnovery, ""Slavic-Aryans""); the antiquity of one's people and its racial or cultural superiority over others; their people (or the ancient ""Aryans"" identified with them) are regarded as cultural tregers, distributors of high culture, founders of great civilizations of antiquity, (in Rodnoverie, Slavic or ""Slavic-Aryan"" ""Vedic"" technological pracivilization, ""taught"" all other peoples), and creators of ancient writing (in Rodnoverie, Slavic runes); ""Aryan"" proto-language (in Rodnoverie, ""Slavic-Aryan"" or Old Slavic), from which all or many other languages of the world originated; reliance on esotericism; orientation to the faith of ancestors (hence paganism); anti-Christianity (the idea that Christians seek to enslave the people) and antisemitism (Jews as ""racial enemies""); ""Aryan"" socialism (an integral part of the ideology of Nazism) as the most natural for its people (in Rodnoverie, the ""original tribal system"" of the Slavs, which is thought of as a kind of ""Aryan"" socialism); symbols and gestures close to or derived from Nazism, etc.
One of the main starting points for the formation of Slavic neopaganism was the search for a rationale for the national idea. Hence follows an increased interest in the origins of national self-consciousness and the national type of religiosity. In the post-Soviet period, in the conditions of the loss of the great ""empire"" (USSR), land, and influence and in search of internal and external enemies, neopaganism became widespread among nationalist ideologues, just like in Germany in the 1930s. In Rodnoverie, the unity of the Russian people was undergoing a new re-mythologization with an appeal for support to the ideas of the ""golden age"", the primordial untainted tradition, and the native land.
Historian Dmitry Shlapentokh wrote that, as in Europe, neopaganism in Russia pushes some of its adherents to antisemitism. This antisemitism is closely related to negative attitudes towards Asians, and this emphasis on racial factors can lead neopagans to neo-Nazism. The tendency of neopagans to antisemitism is a logical development of the ideas of neopaganism and imitation of the Nazis and is also a consequence of some specific conditions of modern Russian politics.
Unlike previous regimes, the current Russian political regime and the ideology of the middle class combine support for Orthodoxy with philosemitism and a positive attitude towards Muslims. These features of the regime contributed to the formation of specific views of neo-Nazi neopagans, which are represented to a large extent among the socially unprotected and marginalized Russian youth. In their opinion, power in Russia was usurped by a cabal of conspirators, including hierarchs of the Orthodox Church, Jews, and Muslims. Contrary to external differences, these forces are believed to have united in their desire to maintain power over the Russian ""Aryans"".
Some associations of neopaganism, in particular Slavic, are evaluated by researchers as extremist, radical nationalists. In Russia, individual neopagan organizations and essays were included in the list of extremist organizations of the Ministry of Justice of Russia and the Federal List of Extremist Materials, respectively.
The historian and ethnologist Victor Schnirelmann considers Russian neopaganism as a direction of Russian nationalism that denies Russian Orthodoxy as an enduring national value and distinguishes two cardinal tasks that Russian neopaganism sets for itself: the salvation of Russian national culture from the leveling influence of modernization and the protection of the natural environment from the impact of modern civilization. According to Schnirelmann, ""Russian neopaganism is a radical variety of conservative ideology, which is distinguished by frank anti-intellectualism and populism.""
Religious scholar Alexei Gaidukov considers it wrong to reduce the diversity of native faith groups to nationalism only – he views the ecological direction of Rodnovery as no less significant. Historian and religious scholar Roman Shizhensky believes Rodnovery poses little danger and law enforcement agencies should deal with radical groups.
The Austrian occultist Guido von List, who created the doctrine of Ariosophy, argued that an ancient developed ""Ario-Germanic"" culture reached its dawn several millennia before Roman colonization and Christianity. According to him, before Charlemagne's forced introduction of Christianity, Wotanism was practiced in what is now the Danubian territory of Germany. List considered Charlemagne the killer of the Saxons in memory of the bloody baptism of the pagans of Northern Germany by him. List considered the entire Christian period as an era of cultural decline, oblivion of the true faith, and unnatural racial mixing, when the ""Aryan"" ruling caste of priest-kings was forced to hide, secretly saving their sacred knowledge, which now became available to List as a full-fledged aristocratic descendant of this caste.
In Slavic neopaganism, there is the idea of an ancient multi-thousand-year-old and developed civilization of the ""Slavs-Aryans"", while the entire Christian period seems to be an era of regression and decline, the enslavement of the ""Aryans"" by foreign missionaries who imposed on them a ""slave"" (Christian) ideology. Rodnovers often regard these missionaries as Jews, ""Judeo-Masons"", or their accomplices. At the same time, the Slavic ""Aryan"" volkhvs or priests had to hide in secret places, preserving the knowledge that was now passed onto their direct descendants, Rodnovers.
The idea of the Jewish-Khazar origin of Prince Vladimir the Great is popular, explaining why he introduced Christianity, an instrument for the enslavement of the ""Aryans"" by Jews, and staged the genocide of the pagan Slavs. Roman Shizhensky singles out the neopagan myth about Vladimir and characterizes it as one of the most ""odious"" neopagan historical myths and one of the leading Russian neopagan myths in terms of worldview significance.
The author of this myth is Valery Yemelyanov, one of the founders of Russian neopaganism, who expounded it in his book Dezionization (1970s). Shizhensky notes that the neopagan myth about Vladimir contradicts scientific work on the issue and the totality of historical sources.
Concerning the trend of convergence of neopagan associations from different countries, Andrey Beskov notes that neopagan nationalism is not an obstacle to ""neopagan internationalism"", and anti-globalism, one of the manifestations of which was the popularity of ethnic religions, itself acquires a global character.

LGBT
The western LGBT community, often marginalized and/or outright rejected by Abrahamic-predominant mainstream religious establishments, has often sought spiritual acceptance and association in neopagan religious/spiritual practice. Pagan-specializing religious scholar Christine Hoff Kraemer wrote, ""Pagans tend to be relatively accepting of same-sex relationships, BDSM, polyamory, transgender people, and other expressions of gender and sexuality that are marginalized by mainstream society."" Conflict naturally arises, however, as some neopagan belief systems and sect ideologies stem from fundamental beliefs in the male–female gender binary, heterosexual pairing, resulting heterosexual reproduction, and/or gender essentialism.
In response, groups and sects inclusive of or specific to LGBT people have developed. Theologian Jone Salomonsen noted in the 1980s and 1990s that the reclaiming movement of San Francisco featured an unusually high number of LGBT people, particularly bisexuals. Margot Adler noted groups whose practices focused on male homosexuality, such as Eddie Buczynski's Minoan Brotherhood, a Wiccan sect that combines the iconography from ancient Minoan religion with a Wiccan theology and an emphasis on men who love men, and the eclectic pagan group known as the Radical Faeries. When Adler asked one gay male pagan what the pagan community offered members of the LGBT community, he replied, ""A place to belong. Community. Acceptance. And a way to connect with all kinds of people – gay, bi, straight, celibate, transgender – in a way that is hard to do in the greater society.""
Transgender existence and acceptability is especially controversial in many neopagan sects. One of the most notable of these is Dianic Wicca. This female-only, radical feminist variant of Wicca allows cisgender lesbians but not transgender women. This is due to Dianic belief in gender essentialism; according to founder Zsuzsanna Budapest, ""you have to have sometimes [sic] in your life a womb, and ovaries and [menstruate] and not die"". This belief and the way it is expressed is often denounced as transphobia and trans-exclusionary radical feminism.
Trans exclusion can also be found in Alexandrian Wicca, whose founder views trans individuals as melancholy people who should seek other beliefs due to the Alexandrian focus on heterosexual reproduction and duality.

Relationship with the New Age movement
Since the 1960s and 1970s, contemporary paganism, or neo-paganism, and the then emergent counterculture, New Age, and hippie movements experienced a degree of cross-pollination. An issue of academic debate has been regarding the connection between these movements. Religious studies scholar Sarah Pike asserted that in the United States, there was a ""significant overlap"" between modern paganism and New Age, while Aidan A. Kelly stated that paganism ""parallels the New Age movement in some ways, differs sharply from it in others, and overlaps it in some minor ways"". Ethan Doyle White stated that while the pagan and New Age movements ""do share commonalities and overlap"", they were nevertheless ""largely distinct phenomena.""
Hanegraaff suggested that whereas various forms of contemporary paganism were not part of the New Age movement – particularly those who pre-dated the movement – other pagan religions and practices could be identified as New Age. Various differences between the two movements have been highlighted; the New Age movement focuses on an improved future, whereas the focus of Paganism is on the pre-Christian past. Similarly, the New Age movement typically propounds a universalist message which sees all religions as fundamentally the same, whereas paganism stresses the difference between monotheistic religions and those embracing a polytheistic or animistic theology. Further, the New Age movement shows little interest in magic and witchcraft, which are conversely core interests of pagan religions such as Wicca.
Many pagans have sought to distance themselves from the New Age movement, even using ""New Age"" as an insult within their community, while conversely many involved in the New Age have expressed criticism of paganism for emphasizing the material world over the spiritual.
Many pagans have expressed criticism of the high fees charged by New Age teachers, something not typically present in the pagan movement.

Relationship with Hinduism
Because of their common links to the Proto-Indo-European culture, many adherents of modern paganism have come to regard Hinduism as a spiritual relative. Some modern pagan literature prominently features comparative religion involving European and Indian traditions. The ECER has made efforts to establish mutual support with Hindu groups, as has the Lithuanian Romuva movement.
In India, a prominent figure who made similar efforts was the Hindu revivalist Ram Swarup, who pointed out parallels between Hinduism and European and Arabic paganism. Swarup reached out to modern pagans in the West and also had an influence on Western converts to Hinduism or pro-Hindu activists, notably David Frawley and Koenraad Elst, who both have described Hinduism as a form of paganism. The modern pagan writer Christopher Gérard has drawn much inspiration from Hinduism and visited Swarup in India. Reviewing Gérard's book Parcours païen in 2001, the historian of religion Jean-François Mayer described Gérard's activities as part of the development of a ""Western-Hindu 'pagan axis'"".

Prejudice and opposition
In the Islamic World, pagans are not considered people of the book, so they do not have the same status as Abrahamic religions in Islamic religious law for example, Muslim men cannot marry pagan women while they are allowed to marry among people of the book; and Muslims can eat meat of halal animals that are slaughtered by people of the book, but not that slaughtered by methods of other religions.
Regarding European paganism, In Modern Paganism in World Cultures: Comparative Perspectives Michael F. Strmiska writes that ""in pagan magazines, websites, and Internet discussion venues, Christianity is frequently denounced as an antinatural, antifemale, sexually and culturally repressive, guilt-ridden, and authoritarian religion that has fostered intolerance, hypocrisy, and persecution throughout the world."" Further, there is a common belief in the pagan community that Christianity and paganism are opposing belief systems. This animosity is flamed by historical conflicts between Christian and pre-Christian religions, as well as the perceived ongoing Christian disdain from Christians. Some pagans have claimed that Christian authorities have never apologized for the religious displacement of Europe's pre-Christian belief systems, particularly following the Roman Catholic Church's apology for past antisemitism in its A Reflection on the Shoah. They also express disapproval of Christianity's continued missionary efforts around the globe at the expense of indigenous and other polytheistic faiths.
Some Christian authors have published books criticizing modern paganism, while other Christian critics have equated paganism with Satanism, which is often portrayed as such in mainstream entertainment industry.
In areas such as the US Bible Belt, where conservative Christian dominance is strong, pagans have faced continued religious persecution. For instance, Strmiska highlighted instances in both the US and UK in which school teachers were fired when their employers discovered that they were pagan.  Thus, many pagans keep their religion private to avoid discrimination and ostracism.

Pagan studies
The earliest academic studies of contemporary paganism were published in the late 1970s and 1980s by scholars like Margot Adler, Marcello Truzzi and Tanya Luhrmann, although it was not until the 1990s that the actual academic field of pagan studies properly developed, pioneered by academics such as Graham Harvey and Chas S. Clifton. Increasing academic interest in paganism has been attributed to the new religious movement's increasing public visibility, as it began interacting with the interfaith movement and holding large public celebrations at sites like Stonehenge.
The first international academic conference on the subject of pagan studies was held at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, North-East England in 1993. It was organised by two British religious studies scholars, Graham Harvey and Charlotte Hardman. In April 1996 a larger conference dealing with contemporary paganism took place at Ambleside in the Lake District. Organised by the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Lancaster, North-West England, it was entitled ""Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s"", and led to the publication of an academic anthology, entitled Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World. In 2004, the first peer-reviewed, academic journal devoted to pagan studies began publication. The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies was edited by Clifton, while the academic publishers AltaMira Press began release of the Pagan Studies Series. From 2008 onward, conferences have been held bringing together scholars specialising in the study of paganism in Central and Eastern Europe.
The relationship between pagan studies scholars and some practising pagans has at times been strained. The Australian academic and practising pagan Caroline Jane Tully argues that many pagans can react negatively to new scholarship regarding historical pre-Christian societies, believing that it is a threat to the structure of their beliefs and to their ""sense of identity"". She furthermore argues that some of those dissatisfied pagans lashed out against academics as a result, particularly on the Internet.

Criticism
Neopaganism has been criticized on a variety of fronts, ranging from pseudohistory to racial issues to institutional issues. As neopaganism is not a unified religion, it means that the criticisms of certain groups often do not apply to other groups. Criticisms of specific neopagan groups range from criticisms of their belief in gender essentialism to criticisms of some belief in nationalism.

William James used the term ""New Thought"" as synonymous with the ""Mind cure movement"", in which he included many sects with diverse origins, such as idealism and Hinduism.

Overview
William James, in The Varieties of Religious Experience (1902), described New Thought:

 [F]or the sake of having a brief designation, I will give the title of the ""Mind-cure movement."" There are various sects of this ""New Thought,"" to use another of the names by which it calls itself; but their agreements are so profound that their differences may be neglected for my present purpose, and I will treat the movement, without apology, as if it were a simple thing.
It is an optimistic scheme of life, with both a speculative and a practical side. In its gradual development during the last quarter of a century, it has taken up into itself a number of contributory elements, and it must now be reckoned with as a genuine religious power. It has reached the stage, for example, when the demand for its literature is great enough for insincere stuff, mechanically produced for the market, to be to a certain extent supplied by publishers – a phenomenon never observed, I imagine, until a religion has got well past its earliest insecure beginnings.

One of the doctrinal sources of Mind-cure is the four Gospels; another is Emersonianism or New England transcendentalism; another is Berkeleyan idealism; another is spiritism, with its messages of ""law"" and ""progress"" and ""development""; another the optimistic popular science evolutionism of which I have recently spoken; and, finally, Hinduism has contributed a strain. But the most characteristic feature of the mind-cure movement is an inspiration much more direct. The leaders in this faith have had an intuitive belief in the all-saving power of healthy-minded attitudes as such, in the conquering efficacy of courage, hope, and trust, and a correlative contempt for doubt, fear, worry, and all nervously precautionary states of mind. Their belief has in a general way been corroborated by the practical experience of their disciples; and this experience forms to-day a mass imposing in amount.

History
Origins
The New Thought movement was based on the teachings of Phineas Quimby (1802–1866), an American mesmerist and healer. Quimby had developed a belief system that included the tenet that illness originated in the mind as a consequence of erroneous beliefs and that a mind open to God's wisdom could overcome any illness. His basic premise was:

The trouble is in the mind, for the body is only the house for the mind to dwell in [...] Therefore, if your mind had been deceived by some invisible enemy into a belief, you have put it into the form of a disease, with or without your knowledge. By my theory or truth, I come in contact with your enemy, and restore you to health and happiness. This I do partly mentally, and partly by talking till I correct the wrong impression and establish the Truth, and the Truth is the cure.
During the late 19th century, the metaphysical healing practices of Quimby mingled with the ""Mental Science"" of Warren Felt Evans, a Swedenborgian minister. Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science, has sometimes been cited as having used Quimby as inspiration for theology. Eddy was a patient of Quimby's and shared his view that disease is rooted in a mental cause. Because of its theism, Christian Science differs from the teachings of Quimby.
In the late 19th century, New Thought was propelled by a number of spiritual thinkers and philosophers and emerged through a variety of religious denominations and churches, particularly the Unity Church and Church of Divine Science (established in 1889 and 1888, respectively), followed by Religious Science (the Institute of Religious Science and Philosophy was established in 1927). Many of its early teachers and students were women; notable among the founders of the movement were Emma Curtis Hopkins, known as the ""teacher of teachers"", Myrtle Fillmore, Malinda Cramer, and Nona L. Brooks; with many of its churches and community centers led by women, from the 1880s to today.

Growth
New Thought is also largely a movement of the printed word.
Prentice Mulford, through writing Your Forces and How to Use Them, a series of essays published during 1886–1892, was pivotal in the development of New Thought thinking, including the Law of Attraction.
In 1906, William Walker Atkinson (1862–1932) wrote and published Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction in the Thought World. Atkinson was the editor of New Thought magazine and the author of more than 100 books on an assortment of religious, spiritual, and occult topics. The following year, Elizabeth Towne, the editor of The Nautilus, published Bruce MacLelland's book Prosperity Through Thought Force, in which he summarized the ""Law of Attraction"" as a New Thought principle, stating ""You are what you think, not what you think you are.""
These magazines were used to reach a large audience then, as others are now. Nautilus magazine, for example, had 45,000 subscribers and a total circulation of 150,000. One Unity Church magazine, Wee Wisdom, was the longest-lived children's magazine in the United States, published from 1893 until 1991. Today, New Thought magazines include Daily Word, published by Unity (Unity.org) and the Religious Science magazine; and Science of Mind, published by the Centers for Spiritual Living.

Major gatherings
The 1915 International New Thought Alliance (INTA) conference – held in conjunction with the Panama–Pacific International Exposition, a world's fair that took place in San Francisco – featured New Thought speakers from far and wide. The PPIE organizers were so favorably impressed by the INTA convention that they declared a special ""New Thought Day"" at the fair and struck a commemorative bronze medal for the occasion, which was presented to the INTA delegates, led by Annie Rix Militz. By 1916, the International New Thought Alliance had encompassed many smaller groups around the world, adopting a creed known as the ""Declaration of Principles"". The Alliance is held together by one central teaching: that people, through the constructive use of their minds, can attain freedom, power, health, prosperity, and all good, molding their bodies as well as the circumstances of their lives. The declaration was revised in 1957, with all references to Christianity removed, and a new statement based on the ""inseparable oneness of God and Man"".

Beliefs
The chief tenets of New Thought are:

Infinite Intelligence or God is omnipotent and omnipresent.
Spirit is the ultimate reality.
True human self-hood is divine.
Divinely attuned thought is a positive force for good.
All disease is mental in origin.
Right thinking has a healing effect.

Evolution of thought
Adherents also generally believe that as humankind gains greater understanding of the world, New Thought itself will evolve to assimilate new knowledge. Alan Anderson and Deb Whitehouse have described New Thought as a ""process"" in which each individual and even the New Thought Movement itself is ""new every moment"". Thomas McFaul has claimed ""continuous revelation"", with new insights being received by individuals continuously over time. Jean Houston has spoken of the ""possible human"", or what we are capable of becoming.

Theological inclusionism
The Home of Truth has, from its inception as the Pacific Coast Metaphysical Bureau in the 1880s, under the leadership of Annie Rix Militz, disseminated the teachings of the Hindu teacher Swami Vivekananda. It is one of the more outspokenly interfaith of New Thought organizations, stating adherence to ""the principle that Truth is Truth where ever it is found and who ever is sharing it"". Joel S. Goldsmith's The Infinite Way incorporates teaching from Christian Science, as well.

Therapeutic ideas
Divine Science, Unity Church, and Religious Science are organizations that developed from the New Thought movement. Each teaches that Infinite Intelligence, or God, is the sole reality. New Thought adherents believe that sickness is the result of the failure to realize this truth. In this line of thinking, healing is accomplished by the affirmation of oneness with the Infinite Intelligence or God.
John Bovee Dods (1795–1862), an early practitioner of New Thought, wrote several books on the idea that disease originates in the electrical impulses of the nervous system and is therefore curable by a change of belief. Later New Thought teachers, such as the early-20th-century author, editor, and publisher William Walker Atkinson, accepted this premise. He connected his idea of mental states of being with his understanding of the new scientific discoveries in electromagnetism and neural processes.

Criticism
The New Thought movement has been criticized as a ""get-rich-quick scheme"" as much of its literature contains esoteric advice to make money.
Although the movement began with roots in feminism and socialism, it increasingly attached itself to far right and racist ideology, arguing that poverty was a sign of spiritual weakness, and that ""for the sake of race improvement... poverty and suffering must not be alleviated by the state.""

Movement
New Thought publishing and educational activities reach approximately 2.5 million people annually. The largest New Thought-oriented denomination is the Japanese Seicho-no-Ie. Other belief systems within the New Thought movement include Jewish Science, Religious Science/Centers for Spiritual Living and Unity. Past denominations have included Psychiana and Father Divine.
Religious Science operates under three main organizations: the Centers for Spiritual Living; the Affiliated New Thought Network; and Global Religious Science Ministries. Ernest Holmes, the founder of Religious Science, stated that Religious Science is not based on any ""authority"" of established beliefs, but rather on ""what it can accomplish"" for the people who practice it. The Science of Mind, authored by Ernest Holmes, while based on a philosophy of being ""open at the top"", focuses extensively on the teachings of Jesus Christ.
Unity, founded by Charles and Myrtle Fillmore, identifies itself as ""Christian New Thought"", focused on ""Christian idealism"", with the Bible as one of its main texts, although not interpreted literally. The other core text is Lessons in Truth by H. Emilie Cady. The Universal Foundation for Better Living, or UFBL, was founded in 1974 by Johnnie Colemon in Chicago, Illinois, after breaking away from the Unity Church for ""blatant racism"".

History
Puritan roots and Congregationalist background
Unitarian Universalism was formed from the consolidation in 1961 of two historically separate Christian denominations, the Universalist Church of America and the American Unitarian Association, both based in the United States; the new organization formed in this merger was the Unitarian Universalist Association. At the time of the North American consolidation, Unitarians and Universalists diverged beyond their roots in liberal Christian theology. They draw from a variety of religious traditions. Individuals may or may not self-identify as Christians or subscribe to Christian beliefs. Unitarian Universalist congregations and fellowships tend to retain some Christian traditions, such as Sunday worship with a sermon and the singing of hymns. The extent to which the elements of any particular faith tradition are incorporated into personal spiritual practice is a matter of individual choice for congregants, in keeping with a creedless, non-dogmatic approach to spirituality and faith development.
New England Unitarians evolved from the Pilgrim Fathers' Congregational Christianity, which was based on a literal reading of the Bible. Liberalizing Unitarians rejected the Trinitarian belief in the tri-personal godhead: Father, Son, and Holy Ghost/Spirit. Instead, they asserted a unitary notion of God. In addition, they rejected the doctrine of original sin, moving away from the Calvinism of the Congregationalists.
New England Universalists rejected the Puritan forefathers' emphasis on the select few, the Elect, who were supposed to be saved from eternal damnation by a just God. Instead Universalists asserted that all people will eventually be reconciled with God.

Universalism
Universalists claim a long history, beginning with several Church Fathers, though some modern scholars question whether these church fathers taught the defining doctrine of Universalism (universal salvation).
This core doctrine asserts that through Christ every single human soul shall be saved, leading to the ""restitution of all things"" (apocatastasis). In 1793, Universalism emerged as a distinct denomination of Christianity in the United States, eventually called the Universalist Church of America. Early American advocates of universal salvation such as Elhanan Winchester, Hosea Ballou and John Murray taught that all souls would achieve salvation, sometimes after a period resembling purgatory. Christian Universalism denies the doctrine of everlasting damnation, and proclaims belief in an entirely loving God who will ultimately redeem all human beings.

Unitarianism
According to Spanish physician, Michael Servetus, he studied the Bible and concluded that the concept of the Trinity, as traditionally conceived, was not biblical. His books On the Errors of the Trinity and Christianismi Restitutio caused much uproar. Servetus was eventually arrested, convicted of heresy, and burned at the stake in Geneva in 1553.
The term ""Unitarian"" entered the English language via Henry Hedworth, who applied it to the teachings of Laelio Sozzini and the Polish Socinians. Unitarian churches were formally established in Transylvania and Poland (by the Socinians) in the second half of the 16th century. There, the first doctrines of religious freedom in Europe were established (in the course of several diets between 1557 and 1568, see Edict of Torda) under the jurisdiction of John Sigismund, King of Hungary and Prince of Transylvania, the only Unitarian monarch. The early Unitarian church not only rejected the Trinity, but also the pre-existence of Christ as well as, in many cases, predestination and original sin as put forward by Augustine of Hippo, and the substitutionary atonement of Christ developed by Anselm of Canterbury and John Calvin. There were several different forms of Christology in the beginnings of the Unitarian movement; ultimately, the dominant Christology became psilanthropism: that Jesus was a man, but one with a unique relationship to God.

Great Britain
Influenced by the Socinian doctrine of the Polish Brethren, the Unitarian minister Samuel Clarke (1675–1729) revised the Book of Common Prayer, removing the Trinitarian Nicene Creed and references to Jesus as God. Theophilus Lindsey also revised the Book of Common Prayer to allow a more tolerant, free Unitarian interpretation. Neither cleric was charged under the Blasphemy Act 1697 that made it an ""offense for any person, educated in or having made profession of the Christian religion, by writing, preaching, teaching or advised speaking, to deny the Holy Trinity"". The Act of Toleration (1689) gave relief to English Dissenters, but excluded Unitarians. The efforts of Clarke and Lindsey met with substantial criticism from the more conservative clergy and laity of the Church of England. In response, in 1774, Lindsey applied for registration of the Essex House as a ""Dissenting place of worship"" with the assistance of barrister John Lee.  On the Sunday following the registration—April 17, 1774—the first true Unitarian congregation discreetly convened in the provisional Essex Street Chapel. In attendance were Lee, Joseph Priestley and the agent of the Massachusetts Colony, Benjamin Franklin. Priestley also founded a reform congregation, but, after his home was burned down in the Priestley Riots, fled with his wife to America, where he became a leading figure in the founding of the church on American soil.
Once laity and clergy relaxed their vehement opposition to the Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813, which finally allowed for protections of dissenting religions, the British and Foreign Unitarian Association was founded in 1825. It has its headquarters in Essex Hall, successor to Lindsey's Essex House.  Two that have been significant in national life are the Cross Street Chapel in Manchester and, Newington Green Unitarian Church in north London. Unitarian congregations in Britain meet under the auspices of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches. There are 170 communities of Unitarians across Britain. The Chief Officer of the British Unitarians was Liz Slade as of 2024.

United States
In the United States, the Unitarian movement began primarily in the Congregational parish churches of New England, which were part of the state church of Massachusetts. These churches, whose buildings may still be seen in many New England town squares, trace their roots to the division of the Puritan colonies into parishes for the administration of their religious needs. In the late 18th century, conflict grew within some of these churches between Unitarian and Trinitarian factions. In 1805, Unitarians gained key faculty positions at Harvard. In 1819 William Ellery Channing preached the ordination sermon for Jared Sparks in Baltimore, outlining the Unitarian position. The American Unitarian Association was founded as a separate denomination in 1825.
By coincidence and unknown to both parties, the AUA was formed on the same day—May 26, 1825—as the British and Foreign Unitarian Association.
In the 19th century, under the influence of Ralph Waldo Emerson (who had been a Unitarian minister) and other transcendentalists, Unitarianism began its long journey from liberal Protestantism to its more pluralist form.

Integration, 1825–1961
After the schism in the Congregational Churches resulting in the foundation (1825) of the American Unitarian Association, some of those churches remained within the Congregational fold and became member congregations of the Congregational organization (later the United Church of Christ), while others voted to become Unitarian. Some of the latter eventually became part of the Unitarian Universalist Association (formed in 1961) during a consolidation of the Unitarian and Universalist churches. Universalist churches in contrast followed a different path, having begun as independent congregations beyond the bounds of the established Puritan churches entirely. The UUA and the United Church of Christ cooperate jointly on social justice initiatives such as the Sexuality Education Advocacy Training project.
In 1961, the American Unitarian Association (AUA) was consolidated with the Universalist Church of America (UCA), thus forming the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA). In the same year, the Canadian Unitarian Council (CUC) formed. The Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) was given corporate status in May 1961 under special acts of legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of New York.
In 1998, the Canadian Unitarian Council and Unitarian Universalist Association dissolved their financial accord, although they continue to cooperate. The CUC had come into being at Meadville Lombard Theological School in 1961. However the continual decline of denominational churches and the almost complete failure of the Universalist movement in Canada had caused the formation of the Council to prompt a plan to merge with the UUA. Opposition to Liberal religious freedom relaxed, so that by 2002 it was agreed to increase autonomy and funding. The amalgamation proved troublesome for the Canadians, a small minority largely ignored, with only 45 congregations and 5,200 members—the Americans were insensitive to cultural differences.

Beliefs and practices
Diversity of beliefs and scriptures
Unitarian Universalism is a religion marked by freedom, reason, and acceptance. As such, Unitarian Universalists practice a non-creedal religion that does not require one to believe in any particular belief or doctrine. Rather than sharing common beliefs, Unitarian Universalists are united by a common history, the affirmation of each person's individual spiritual quest, and a covenant to uphold the community's shared spiritual values.  As such, Unitarian Universalists vary greatly in their beliefs, and a plurality of beliefs often defines Unitarian Universalist congregations.
Unitarian Universalists are encouraged to engage in their own unique spiritual journey and to follow their conscience in their beliefs. Unitarian Universalism is seen as compatible with other spiritual paths, and individual Unitarian Universalists are encouraged to engage in their own spiritual journey, whatever the path. Unitarian Universalists are not required to renounce previous faith traditions to join a Unitarian Universalist congregation. As a result, individual practitioners may simultaneously identify as Unitarian Universalists and other faith traditions.
Although Unitarian Universalism draws its roots from Christian sources, contemporary Unitarian Universalists in North America view their religion as multifaith and drawing on a variety of sources, both religious and secular. Unitarian Universalism encourages its members to draw on the world's religions as well as the words and deeds of prophetic people as inspiration for their spiritual journeys. Although members are cautioned to be aware of possible cultural appropriation of traditions that do not belong to them, Unitarian Universalists are encouraged to find wisdom in a diverse spectrum of religions, customs, and cultures from around the world.

Humanism and beliefs about divinity
Although the predecessors of Unitarian Universalism, Unitarianism and Universalism, find their origin in unorthodox beliefs about the nature of the Christian God, modern Unitarian Universalists hold a variety of views about the nature and existence of deity. Most Unitarian Universalist congregations take no formal stance on whether or not a god or gods exist but leave it up to individual members to decide for themselves what they believe. Unitarian Universalists may be atheists, agnostics, and theists. Among those Unitarian Universalists who use language of divinity, both monotheism and polytheism are common, and Unitarian Universalists hold a variety of beliefs about the nature of the divine.
The diversity of beliefs about divinity in Unitarian Universalism can be accounted for because of the influence of religious humanism on the movement in the late nineteenth century. Although Unitarian Universalists believe that anyone can be a Humanist, regardless of their position on the use of the language of divinity, the rise of religious humanism within Unitarian Universalism enables members to be able to further question the existence and nature of the divine through its encouragement towards reason. Fifteen of the thirty-four signers of Humanist Manifesto I were Unitarians and one was a Universalist. Unitarian Universalists were also a significant presence among the signers of Humanist Manifestos II and III.
Today, the majority of Unitarian Universalists in North America identify as Humanists. Although Humanism is seen as an evolving philosophy where the limits of science and reason are recognized, its tenets continue to play a large role in the thought of Unitarian Universalist congregations. Unitarian Universalist Humanists hold that the naturalism of their Humanism encourages individuals to recognize the awe, beauty, and wonder of the natural world and recognize the interdependence between humans and other beings.

Covenant
In the absence of shared beliefs, Unitarian Universalists often see their religion as a covenantal (as opposed to a creedal) one. Unitarian Universalists see covenants as the promises that bind congregations, communities, and individuals together in a community. In Unitarian Universalism, covenants are mutual promises among individuals and communities about how they will behave and engage with each other. Covenants help create trust and care among Unitarian Universalists and in their congregations.
Rather than creating things people have to do, covenants in Unitarian Universalist communities create freedom by helping members know what to expect from each other. In the words of Unitarian Universalist minister Alice Blair Wesley:

""...authentic human freedom is of necessity, lawful freedom, and because we receive the possibility of freedom as a gift of the way things are, an authentic covenant is: a glad promise to live freely together, insofar as we are able, in accordance with the laws of reality that make our freedom possible. This is true whether the agreement is between just two, as in a union of marriage, or whether the agreement is among millions, as in a free nation, or whether the agreement is among members who gather to be a free congregation.""
The use of covenants in the Unitarian Universalist community dates back to 1646 and the creation of the Cambridge Platform by the Congregational churches of colonial New England, some of whom would later become Unitarians, predecessors of modern Unitarian Universalists. The Platform was the first formal declaration of the principles of church order and governance in colonial North America. Today, many Unitarian Universalist congregations create their own covenants, often called covenants of right relations, to lay out the principles of their congregations formally.

Principles
In the United States, members of the Unitarian Universalist Association covenanted together via the seven Principles and Purposes, a part of Article II of the Unitarian Universalist Association's bylaws. These Principles and Purposes were statements of shared values that Unitarian Universalist congregations agreed to uphold:

The inherent worth and dignity of every person;
Justice, equity and compassion in human relations;
Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our congregations;
A free and responsible search for truth and meaning;
The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our congregations and in society at large;
The goal of world community with peace, liberty, and justice for all;
Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part.
These principles, first adopted in 1960 and later revised in 1984 and 1985, proved so popular that many Unitarian Universalists came to see them as a wisdom source in and of themselves and a guide for participation in Unitarian Universalist congregations.
In June 2024, the UU General Assembly voted to replace the 7 principles in Article II of the UUA bylaws with a new covenant of 6 values, centered on Love.
In Canada, members of the Canadian Unitarian Council affirm the seven principles along with an eighth principle: ""Individual and communal action that accountably dismantles racism and systemic barriers to full inclusion in ourselves and our institutions.""
In the Philippines, where Unitarian Universalism is much more theistically oriented, member congregations of the Unitarian Universalist Church of the Philippines affirm the seven principles, but with the addition of their own first principle: ""There is God. God is love.""

Justice
Unitarian Universalism believes that actions taken to make the world a better place are more important than what a person actually believes, as espoused by a common slogan in Unitarian Universalist congregations, ""Deeds, not creeds."" They hold that belief divorced from action does not change the world and that good intentions often lead to a worse situation in the long term. Unitarian Universalist thinkers have long recognized the need to bring belief and action together and encourage their members to go into the larger world and improve it.
Because of this importance of action, Unitarian Universalists have long been involved in social, economic, and environmental justice movements, both through organizations created by Unitarian Universalists and through local, regional, national, and international grassroots organizing. Many Unitarian Universalists see this work as inseparable from their Unitarian Universalist faith and see their participation in justice movements as a deeply important part of their religious faith.
Historically, the Unitarian Universalist Association's predecessor movements, Unitarianism and Universalism, saw members involved in abolitionism, women's suffrage, pacifism, temperance, and prison reform. Today, Unitarian Universalists are deeply involved in causes such as racial justice and the Black Lives Matter movement,  LGBTQ movements, feminism and women's rights, immigration justice, reproductive rights, climate justice, and economic inequality.

Worship and practices
Diversity of practices
The Unitarian belief that reason, and not creed, defines the search for truth, and the Universalist belief that God embraces all people equally has led to the current Unitarian Universalist belief that truth and spiritual meaning can be found in all faiths. This is reflected in the wide array of spiritual practices found among Unitarian Universalists today. Many Unitarian Universalist congregations include Buddhist-style meditation groups, Jewish Seder, Yom Kippur and Passover dinners, iftaar meals (marking the breaking of Ramadan fast for Muslims), and Christmas Eve/Winter Solstice services. Children's and youth's religious education classes teach about the divinity of the world and the sanctity of world religions. One of its more popular curricula, Neighboring Faiths (formerly Church Across the Street), takes middle and high school participants to visit the places of worship of many faith traditions including a Hindu temple, a Reform or Orthodox synagogue, and a Catholic church.
There is great variety among Unitarian Universalist congregations, with some favoring particular religious beliefs or forms of worship over others, with many more home to an eclectic mix of beliefs. Regardless of their orientation, most congregations are fairly open to differing beliefs, though not always with various faith traditions represented to the same degree.

Diversity of congregations
There is a wide variety in how congregations conceive of themselves, calling themselves ""churches"", ""societies"", ""fellowships"", ""congregations"", or eschew the use of any particular descriptor. Many use the name ""Unitarian Universalist"", (and a few ""Universalist Unitarian""), having gradually adopted this formulation since consolidation in 1961. Others use names that reflect their historic roots by keeping the historical designation ""Unitarian"" or ""Universalist"" (e.g. ""First Unitarian Church""). A few congregations use neither (e.g. Unity Temple). For some congregations, the name can be a clue to their theological orientation. For others, avoidance of the word ""church"" indicates a desire to distance itself from traditional Christian theology. Sometimes the use of another term may simply indicate a congregation's lay-led or relatively new status. However, some Unitarian Universalist congregations have grown to appreciate alternative terms such as fellowship and retained them even though they have grown much larger or lost features sometimes associated with their use (such as, in the case of fellowships, a traditionally lay-led worship model).
Also of note is that there are many more people who identify as Unitarian Universalist on surveys than those who attend Unitarian Universalist congregations (by a factor of four in a recent survey), reflecting those who have never joined (and lapsed members) but nonetheless consider themselves part of the Unitarian Universalist movement.

Elevator speeches
In 2004, UU World magazine asked for contributions of ""elevator speeches"" explaining Unitarian Universalism. These are short speeches that could be made in the course of an elevator ride to those who knew nothing of the religion. Here are examples of the speeches submitted:

 In Unitarian Universalist congregations, we gather in community to support our individual spiritual journeys. We trust that openness to one another's experiences will enhance our understanding of our own links with the divine, with our history, and with one another. 
 Most Unitarian Universalists believe that nobody has a monopoly on all truth, or ultimate proof of the truth of everything in any one belief. Therefore, one's own truth is unprovable, as is that of others. Consequently, we should respect the beliefs of others, as well as their right to hold those beliefs. Conversely, we expect that others should respect our right to our own beliefs. Several UU's then, would likely hold as many different beliefs. Other beliefs they may hold in common are a respect for others, for nature, and for common decency, leading to a particular caring for the poor, the weak and the downtrodden. As a result, issues of justice, including social justice are held in common among most. 
 It's a blessing each of us was born; It matters what we do with our lives; What each of us knows about God is a piece of the truth; We don't have to do it alone.

Worship and ritual
As in theology, Unitarian Universalist worship and ritual are often a combination of elements derived from other faith traditions alongside original practices and symbols. In form, church services might be difficult to distinguish from those of a Protestant church, but they vary widely among congregations.

Symbols
The most common symbol of Unitarian Universalism is the flaming chalice, often framed by two overlapping rings that many interpret as representing Unitarianism and Universalism (the symbol has no official interpretation). The chalice itself has long been a symbol of liberal religion, and indeed liberal Christianity (the Disciples of Christ also use a chalice as their denomination symbol). The flaming chalice was initially the logo of the Unitarian Service Committee during the Second World War. It was created by Austrian artist Hans Deutsch. The holy oil burning in it is a symbol of helpfulness and sacrifice.
Nevertheless, other interpretations have been suggested, such as the chalice used by the followers of Czech Jan Hus, which was supposedly reverential of Eastern Orthodox traditions; although Hus's early National Church was intrinsically an evangelical Protestant. In some agnostic historiographies the flaming chalice displayed a vague resemblance to a cross in some stylized representations, relying on the sepulchral traditions of the Hospitallers.  Many Unitarian Universalist congregations light a chalice at the beginning of worship services. Other symbols include an off-center cross within a circle (a Universalist symbol associated with the Humiliati movement in the 1950s, a group of reformist, liturgically minded clergy seeking to revive Universalism).
Other symbols include a pair of open hands releasing a dove.

Services of worship
Religious services are usually held on Sundays and most closely resemble the form and format of Protestant worship in the Reformed tradition. Services at a vast majority of congregations follow a structure that focuses on a sermon or presentation by a minister, a lay leader of the congregation, or an invited speaker. Sermons may cover a wide range of topics. Since Unitarian Universalists do not recognize a particular text or set of texts as primary or inherently superior, inspiration can be found in many different religious or cultural texts as well as the personal experiences of the minister.
The service also includes hymn-singing, accompanied by organ, piano, or other available instruments, and possibly led by a song leader or choir. The most recent worship songbook published by the denomination, Singing the Journey contains 75 songs and is a supplement to the older Singing the Living Tradition which contains readings as well. Hymns typically sung in Unitarian Universalist services come from a variety of sources—traditional hymn tunes with new or adapted lyrics, spirituals, folk songs from various cultures, or original compositions by Unitarian Universalist musicians are just a few. Instrumental music is also a common feature of the typical worship service, including preludes, offertory music, postludes, or music for contemplation.
Pastoral elements of the service may include a time for sharing Joys and Sorrows/Concerns, where individuals in the congregation are invited to light a candle or say a few words about important events in their personal lives. Many also include a time of meditation or prayer, led by the minister or service leader, both spoken and silent. Responsive readings and stories for children are also typical. Many congregations also allow for a time at the end of the service, called ""talk back"", where members of the congregation can respond to the sermon with their own insights and questions, or even disagree with the viewpoint expressed by the minister or invited speaker.
Many Unitarian Universalist congregations no longer observe the Christian sacraments of baptism, communion, or confirmation, at least in their traditional forms or under their traditional names. Congregations that continue these practices under their more traditional names are often federated churches or members of the Council of Christian Churches within the Unitarian Universalist Association (CCCUUA), or may have active chapters associated with the Unitarian Universalist Christian Fellowship or similar covenant groups. ""Child dedications"" often replace more traditional infant baptisms (such ""dedications"" are sometimes practiced even in ""orthodox"" Christian communities that do not baptize infants for theological reasons). Annual celebrations of Water Communion and Flower Communion may replace or supplement Christian-style communion (though many pluralist and Christian-oriented congregations may celebrate or otherwise make provisions for communion on Christian holy days). Confirmation may be replaced by a ""Coming of Age"" program, in which teenagers explore their individual religious identity, often developing their own credo. After they have completed exploring their spiritual beliefs, they write a speech about it which they then personally deliver to the congregation.
Services can vary widely between congregations, and can incorporate dancing, contemporary music and poetry, readings taken from secular fiction or original works by congregants.

Politics
Historical politics of Unitarians and Universalists
In the 19th century, Unitarians and Universalists were active in abolitionism, the women's movement, the temperance movement, and other social reform movements. The second women's rights convention was held at the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, New York. Additionally, four Presidents of the United States were Unitarians: John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Millard Fillmore, and William Howard Taft.

Politics of Unitarian Universalists
Historically, Unitarian Universalists have often been active in political causes, notably the civil rights movement, the LGBT rights movement, the social justice movement, and the feminist movement.
Susan B. Anthony, a Unitarian and Quaker, was extremely influential in the women's suffrage movement. Unitarian Universalists and Quakers still share many principles. It is therefore common to see Unitarian Universalists and Quakers working together.
Unitarian Universalists were and are still very involved in the fight to end racism in the United States. John Haynes Holmes, a Unitarian minister and social activist at The Community Church of New York—Unitarian Universalist was among the founders of both the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909 and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), chairing the latter for a time. James J. Reeb, a minister at All Souls Church, Unitarian, in Washington, D.C., and a member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, was clubbed in Selma, Alabama on March 8, 1965, and died two days later of massive head trauma. Two weeks after his death, Viola Liuzzo, a Unitarian Universalist civil rights activist, was murdered by white supremacists after her participation in the protest march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. The Selma to Montgomery marches for voting rights are best known for Bloody Sunday, which refers to March 7, 1965, the most violent of the three marches.
The past head of the Unitarian Universalist Association 2001–2009, William G. Sinkford, is African-American, making Unitarian Universalism one of the first traditionally white denominations to be headed by a member of a racial minority.
While political liberals make up a clear majority of Unitarian Universalists, the movement aspires to diversity, and officially welcomes congregants regardless of their political views. Politically conservative Unitarian Universalists point out that neither theological liberalism nor the Principles and Purposes of the UUA require liberal politics. Like the beliefs of Unitarian Universalists, politics are decided by individuals, not by congregations or the denomination.

Several congregations have undertaken a series of organizational, procedural and practical steps to become acknowledged as a ""Welcoming Congregation"": a congregation which has taken specific steps to welcome and integrate gay, lesbian, bisexual & transgender (LGBT) members. Unitarian Universalist ministers perform same-sex unions and now same-sex marriages where legal (and sometimes when not, as a form of civil protest). On June 29, 1984, the Unitarian Universalists became the first major church ""to approve religious blessings on homosexual unions."" Unitarian Universalists have been in the forefront of the work to make same-sex marriages legal in their local states and provinces, as well as on the national level. Gay men, bisexuals, and lesbians are also regularly ordained as ministers, and a number of gay, bisexual, and lesbian ministers have, themselves, now become legally married to their partners. In May 2004, Arlington Street Church, in Boston, Massachusetts, was the site of the first state-sanctioned same-sex marriage in the United States. The official stance of the UUA is for the legalization of same-sex marriage—""Siding with Love"". In 2004 UU minister Debra Haffner of The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing published An Open Letter on Religious Leaders on Marriage Equality to affirm same-sex marriage from a multi-faith perspective. In December 2009, Washington, D.C., Mayor Adrian Fenty signed the bill to legalize same-sex marriage for the District of Columbia in All Souls Church.
Unitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness engages Unitarian Universalist ministers and other leaders to educate them on polyamory. At the 2015 UUA General Assembly, the Association's non-discrimination rule was amended to include the category of ""family and relationship structures""; the UUA has yet to take specific follow-up action on this, however.
Many congregations are heavily involved in projects and efforts aimed at supporting environmental causes and sustainability. These are often termed ""seventh principle"" activities because of the seventh principle quoted above.

Controversies
External
Lack of formal creed
In May 2004, Texas Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn ruled that Unitarian Universalism was not a ""religion"" because it ""does not have one system of belief"", and stripped the Red River Unitarian Universalist Church in Denison, Texas, of its tax-exempt status. However, within weeks, Strayhorn reversed her decision.

Confusion with other groups
There are separate movements and organizations who hold to classical Unitarian or Christian universalist Christian theology and neither belong to the Unitarian Universalist Association nor consider themselves Unitarian Universalists. The American Unitarian Conference and the Christian Universalist Association are the two most significant organizations representing these theological beliefs today. Christians who hold these beliefs tend to consider themselves the true Unitarians or Universalists and heirs of the theological legacy of the original American Unitarian Association or Universalist Church of America, and they do not wish to be confused with Unitarian Universalists. The Unity Church is another denomination that is often confused with Unitarian Universalism.

In 1992, the UUA published statements opposing the BSA's policies of discriminating against homosexuals, atheists, and agnostics; and in 1993, the UUA updated the curriculum guidance of its ""Religion in Life"" emblems program for young people in scouting to include criticism of the BSA policies. On account of the published criticism, in 1998 the BSA withdrew its recognition of UUA's Religion in Life emblem program. Subsequently, the UUA removed the objectionable material from the program curriculum and the BSA renewed recognition of the Religion in Life program. Later, the UUA issued internal, supplemental material to emblems-program workbooks that included general statements critical of discrimination on bases of sexual orientation or personal religious viewpoint. When the BSA learned of those (internal) statements it again withdrew recognition of the UUA Religion in Life emblems program.
In 2004, the Unitarian Universalist Scouters Organization (UUSO), a group not affiliated with the UUA, established their ""Living Your Religion"" emblems program for UU-BSA scouts. Without the knowledge or approval of the UUA, the program was approved by the BSA Religious Relationships committee in 2005. Upon being notified of the UUSO program the UUA issued a statement (March 16, 2005) clarifying that UUSO was not an affiliate organization of the UUA and asserting that, contrary to reports otherwise, UU congregations were still awarding the UUA Religion in Life emblem to their youth members in BSA Scouts—whose emblems then were worn on the Scouts' uniforms without complaint from the BSA. Further, the statement made clear that the UUA still maintained its criticism of both the BSA's ongoing discrimination against gay Scouts and gay Scout leaders and the BSA requirement of a religious litmus test for membership.
Later events made these issues moot: In 2013, BSA opened its membership to gay youth, followed by opening membership to gay adults in 2015, which policy changes resolved the main UUA objection to supporting BSA. The UUSO dissolved in 2015 and by 2016, via a memorandum of understanding, the UUA religious emblems program was again formally recognized by BSA.

Internal
Language of reverence
During the presidency of William Sinkford, debate roiled the Unitarian Universalist (U.U.) movement over his call to return to, or to re-create, an authentic Unitarian Universalist ""language of reverence."" Sinkford suggested that as Unitarian Universalists abandoned traditional religious language they would relinquish, to others, religion's words of power. These other religionists would proceed to dictate their meanings of religious words and language, including scripture, in the public sphere. He advocated that Unitarian Universalists should regain their proper seat at the interfaith table by making this language their own. In response, others saw his idea as an effort to return Unitarian Universalist congregations to more orthodox Christian worship patterns. Indeed, some were concerned that it might be a call to oppose the growing influence among UUs of humanism and atheism, the adherents of which would  be made unwelcome within the community. Sinkford denied such motives, citing the words of Unitarian Universalist humanists as examples of what he meant by ""language of reverence"".
The growth of humanism among Unitarian Universalists stemmed in part from the congregational commitment to reach a universal audience while educating U.U. folk in biblical literacy, many of whom were born into families that eschewed or minimized religious or moral catechisms. (In addition to humanists, these people comprehend atheists and theists, agnostics, skeptics and seekers, non-member affiliates, the religion-alienated and others among the larger UU congregation.)
The debate saw the publication of a book by the UUA Beacon Press, written by former UUA President John Buehrens and titled Understanding the Bible: An Introduction for skeptics, seekers, and religious liberals. Meant to serve as a kind of handbook to be read alongside the Bible, it provides interpretative strategies from a liberal religious perspective for the reader to engage in conversation about the Bible—what it says and what it means today. Positive engagement is intended rather than to relinquish all public conversation to others over interpretation of the Bible. Another important work by Buehrens, with Forrest Church, is A Chosen Faith: An Introduction to Unitarian Universalism, in which the authors present the many sources of the Unitarian Universalist faith.

Borrowing from other religions
The ""borrowing"" of religious rituals from other faith traditions by Unitarian Universalists was discussed at the Unitarian Universalist General Assembly in 2001 during a seminar titled ""Cultural Appropriation: Reckless Borrowing or Appropriate Cultural Sharing"" by the Religious Education Dept, UUA. Of particular discussion was the borrowing rituals and practices that are sacred to specific tribes or using spiritual practices without real context.

Racism
Internal controversy over the hiring of the UUA's Southern Region Lead (a white man from outside the region was hired rather than a Latina woman who resided within the region) led to resignations and apologies in 2017. UUA President Peter Morales, the denomination's first Latino president, resigned amid criticism of his failure to address the diversity controversies. The three co-presidents who took over commissioned a ""racism audit"" to address white supremacy within the denomination. In April 2018, The Washington Post reported that the UUA ""in the past year has been asked to help resolve 15 congregational conflicts involving religious professionals of color"".

India is one of the three countries in the world (Nepal (81%) and Mauritius (48%) being the other two) where Hinduism is the dominant religion.

History of Hinduism
The Vedic culture developed in India in 1500 BCE and 500 BCE. After this period, the Vedic religion merged with local traditions and the renouncer traditions, resulting in the emergence of Hinduism, which has had a profound impact on India's history, culture and philosophy. The name India itself is derived from Sanskrit Sindhu, the historic local appellation for the Indus River.
India saw the rule of both Hindu and Muslim rulers from c. 1200 CE to 1750 CE. The fall of Vijayanagara Empire to Muslim sultans had marked the end of Hindu dominance in the Deccan. Hinduism once again rose to political prestige, under the Maratha Empire.

Partition of India
The 1947 Partition of India gave rise to bloody rioting and indiscriminate inter-communal killing of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs across the Indian subcontinent, specially in Punjab region. An estimated 7.3 million Hindus and Sikhs moved to India and 7.2 million Muslims moved to Pakistan permanently, leading to demographic change of  both the nations to a certain extent. As a result of this, India's Hindu population have increased exponentially from 74.8% in 1941 to 84.1% in 1951 Census respectively. 

""I find no parallel in history for a body of converts and their descendants claiming to be a nation apart from the parent stock.""

Hindu population decline in South Asia
Hinduism dropped from 72% in British Raj of 1891 to 69% in 1921. In 1941 British census, Hindus comprised 69.5% of Undivided India. It further declined to just 66% in Undivided India since Muslims would make up 32% of Undivided India's population in 2024, if not partitioned, respectively.

Demographics
The Hindu population has tripled from 303,675,084 in 1951 to 966,257,353 in 2011, but the Hindu percentage share of total population has declined from 84.1% in 1951 to 79.8% in 2011. When India achieved independence in 1947, Hindus formed roughly 85% of the total population and pre-Partition British India had about 73% of Hindus.

Projections
According to a report by the Pew Research Center (PRC), the Hindu population in India is projected to reach almost 1.3 billion by 2050, within a total population nearing 1.7 billion. Despite this growth, the community proportion within the nation's population is anticipated to decrease by 2.8 percent, declining from 79.5 percent in 2010 to 76.7 percent in 2050, owing to low fertility rate, high mortality rate and emigration, respectively.

Fertility rates
The latest round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), conducted from 2019-2021, has shown a notable change in fertility trends in India. The Total Fertility Rate (TFR), which measures the average number of children per woman, has dropped below the replacement level of 2.1 respectively. Specifically, among Hindus, the TFR stands at 1.9, indicating that on average, each Hindu woman is having fewer than two children in her reproductive lifespan. This trend suggests a significant shift towards smaller family sizes within the Hindu community, reflecting broader demographic changes in the country.

Emigration
A report published in a major Pakistani newspaper indicates that over 5,000 Pakistani Hindus migrate to India annually as refugees. Dr. Abul Barkat, a highly esteemed academic figure affiliated with Dhaka University, has provided insights indicating that an estimated 230,000 Bangladeshi Hindus undertake migration to India annually, with the primary motive of seeking asylum and ensuring personal safety. This migration pattern underscores a notable trend contributing to a substantial influx of refugees from Bangladesh to India.

Law and politics
Demand for Hindu state
Although the Constitution of India has declared the nation as a secular state with no state religion, it has been argued several times that the Indian state privileges Hinduism as state sponsored religion constitutionally, legislatively and culturally. 

The original copy of the Indian constitution has an illustration of Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana in Part III on Fundamental Rights and Rama has been considered as the true guardian of people's rights.
Article 343 (1) of the Indian Constitution also states that, ""The official language of the Union shall be Hindi in Devanagari script"".
Also, Article 48 of Indian constitution prohibits the slaughter of cows or calves (a sacred animal in Hinduism) and it is a criminal offense in most of the states of India.
Some right-wing Hindu organisations like Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Hindu Mahasabha, Bajrang Dal, Vishwa Hindu Parishad etc. have demanded that India should be declared a Hindu nation by constitution to safeguard the rights and life of Hindus in this largest democracy. As of 28 July 2020, there were pleas going on Supreme Court of India to remove the words secular and socialist from the Preamble to the Constitution of India. As far as citizens are concerned, only 7 out of 20 Indian Hindus are in favor of making India a Hindu Nation. Nearly two-thirds of Indian Hindus, constituting 64% of the population, believe that it is very important to be Hindu to be considered truly Indian or a citizen of India respectively.

Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019
The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 is a law passed in India in December 2019. Under the Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, it provides a fast-track to Indian citizenship for undocumented immigrants from neighbouring countries, namely Hindus and five other specific communities: Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Parsis, and Jains, who arrived in India before December 31, 2014. The law has reduced the residency requirement for undocumented immigrants from select religious minorities, including Hindus, from 11 years to 5 years for acquiring Indian citizenship through naturalization. This provision aims to expedite the citizenship process for these specific persecuted minority groups of neighbouring nations of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

History
Origins
The vast majority of the Muslims in India belong to South Asian ethnic groups. However, some Indian Muslims were found with detectable, traceable levels of gene flow from outside, primarily from the Middle East and Central Asia. However, they are found in very low levels. Sources indicate that the castes among Muslims developed as the result of the concept of Kafa'a. Those who are referred to as Ashrafs are presumed to have a superior status derived from their foreign Arab ancestry, while the Ajlafs are assumed to be converts from Hinduism, and have a lower status But According to Islamic teachings, Muslims are regarded as one Ummah, and dividing into sects is considered a sin, as it contradicts the unity and brotherhood emphasized in the Quran and Hadith. The Prophet Muhammad, in his final sermon, stated that no Arab is superior to a non-Arab, neither is a white superior to a black, nor a black to a white, except by piety and good deeds. Which Emphasize the principle of equality among Muslims.
Many of these ulema also believed that it is best to marry within one's own caste. The practice of endogamous marriage in one's caste is strictly observed in India. In two of the three genetic studies referenced here, in which is described that samples were taken from several regions of India's Muslim communities, it was again found that the Muslim population was overwhelmingly similar to the local non-Muslims associated, with some having minor but still detectable levels of gene flow from outside, primarily from Iran and Central Asia, rather than directly from the Arabian peninsula.
Research on the comparison of Y chromosomes of Indian Muslims with other Indian groups was published in 2005. In this study 124 Sunnis and 154 Shias of Uttar Pradesh were randomly selected for their genetic evaluation. Other than Muslims, Hindu higher and middle caste group members were also selected for the genetic analysis. Out of 1021 samples in this study, only 17 samples showed E haplogroup and all of them were Shias. The very minor increased frequency however, does place these Shias, solely with regards to their haplogroups, closer to Iraqis, Turks and Palestinians.

Early history of Islam in India
Trade relations have existed between Arabia and the Indian subcontinent since ancient times. Even in the pre-Islamic era, Arab traders used to visit the Konkan-Gujarat coast and Malabar Coast, which linked them with the ports of Southeast Asia. Newly Islamised Arabs were Islam's first contact with India. Historians Elliot and Dowson say in their book The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians, that the first ship bearing Muslim travellers was seen on the Indian coast as early as 630 CE. H. G. Rawlinson in his book Ancient and Medieval History of India claims that the first Arab Muslims settled on the Indian coast in the last part of the 7th century CE. This fact is corroborated by J. Sturrock in his Madras District Manuals and by Haridas Bhattacharya in Cultural Heritage of India Vol. IV. With the rise of Islam, Arabs emerged as a significant cultural force on the global stage. Through their extensive trade and commerce networks, Arab merchants and traders became key ambassadors of the faith, shared its teachings wherever they traveled.
According to popular tradition, Islam was brought to Lakshadweep islands, situated just to the west of Malabar Coast, by Ubaidullah in 661 CE. His grave is believed to be located on the island of Andrott. A few Umayyad (661–750 CE) coins were discovered from Kothamangalam in the eastern part of Ernakulam district, Kerala. According to Kerala Muslim tradition, the Masjid Zeenath Baksh at Mangalore is one of the oldest mosques in the Indian subcontinent. According to the Legend of Cheraman Perumals, the first Indian mosque was built in 624 CE at Kodungallur in present-day Kerala with the mandate of the last the ruler (the Cheraman Perumal) of Chera dynasty, who converted to Islam during the lifetime of the Islamic prophet Muhammad (c. 570–632). According to Qissat Shakarwati Farmad, the Masjids at Kodungallur, Kollam, Madayi, Barkur, Mangalore, Kasaragod, Kannur, Dharmadam, Panthalayini, and Chaliyam, were built during the era of Malik Dinar, and they are among the oldest Masjids in the Indian subcontinent. It is believed that Malik Dinar died at Thalangara in Kasaragod town.
The first Indian mosque, Cheraman Juma Mosque, is thought to have been built in 629 CE by Malik Deenar although some historians say the first mosque was in Gujarat in between 610 and 623 CE. In Malabar, the Mappilas may have been the first community to convert to Islam. Intensive missionary activities were carried out along the coast and many other natives embraced Islam. According to legend, two travellers from India, Moulai Abdullah (formerly known as Baalam Nath) and Maulai Nuruddin (Rupnath), went to the court of Imam Mustansir (427–487 AH)/(1036–1094 CE) and were so impressed that they converted to Islam and came back to preach in India in 467 AH/1073 CE. Moulai Ahmed was their companion. Abadullah was the first Wali-ul-Hind (saint of India). He came across a married couple named Kaka Akela and Kaki Akela who became his first converts in the Taiyabi (Bohra) community.

Arab–Indian interactions
Historical evidence shows that Arabs and Muslims interacted with Indians from the  early days of Islam and possibly before the arrival of Islam in Arab regions. Arab traders transmitted the numeral system developed by Indians to the Middle East and Europe.
Many Sanskrit books were translated into Arabic as early as the 8th century. George Saliba in his book ""Islamic Science and the Making of the European Renaissance"", writes that ""some major Sanskrit texts began to be translated during the reign of the second Abbasid caliph al-Mansur (r. 754–775), if not before; some texts on logic even before that, and it has been generally accepted that the Persian and Sanskrit texts, few as they were, were indeed the first to be translated.""
Commercial intercourse between Arabia and India had gone on from time immemorial, with for example the sale of dates and aromatic herbs by Arabs traders who came to Indian shores every spring with the advent of the monsoon breeze. People living on the western coast of India were as familiar with the annual coming of Arab traders as they were with the flocks of monsoon birds; they were as ancient a phenomenon as the monsoon itself. However, whereas monsoon birds flew back to Africa after a sojourn of few months, not all traders returned to their homes in the desert; many married Indian women and settled in India.
The advent of Muhammad (569–632 CE) transformed the previously idolatrous and fragmented Arabs into a nation unified by faith and driven by a shared commitment to spreading the message of Islam. Arab merchant seamen, who had long brought goods like dates to South India, now introduced the new religion, which found a warm reception in the region. South Indian communities welcomed the construction of mosques and facilitated cultural integration, including intermarriage between Arabs and local women. This led to the formation of a distinct Indian-Arabian Muslim community. By the early 9th century, Muslim missionaries in Malabar achieved a significant milestone when they inspired the conversion of the local king to Islam.
According to historian Derryl N. Maclean, early connections between Sindh (in present-day Pakistan) and the Shia supporters of Ali can be traced to Hakim ibn Jabalah al-Abdi. A companion of Muhammad, Hakim traveled through Sind to Makran in 649 CE, reporting on the region to the Caliph. A devoted supporter of Ali, Hakim died in the Battle of the Camel alongside Sindhi Jats. He was also a poet and few couplets of his poem in praise of Ali ibn Abu Talib have survived, as reported in Chachnama.
During Ali's leadership, numerous Jats in Sind embraced Islam, influenced by the efforts of figures like Harith ibn Murrah al-Abdi and Sayfi ibn Fil' al-Shaybani, officers in Ali’s army. In 658 CE, they led campaigns against Sindhi bandits, pursuing them as far as Al-Qiqan (modern-day Quetta). Sayfi was later killed in 660 CE near Damascus as one of seven loyal companions of Ali who were beheaded alongside Hujr ibn Adi al-Kindi. in 660 CE, near Damascus.

Political history of Islam in India
Muhammad bin Qasim (672 CE), at the age of 17, was the first Muslim general to invade the Indian subcontinent, managing to reach Sindh. In the first half of the 8th century CE, a series of battles took place between the Umayyad Caliphate and the Indian kingdoms; resulted in Umayyad campaigns in India checked and contained to Sindh. Around the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic empire, the Ghaznavids, under Mahmud of Ghazni (971–1030 CE), was the second, much more ferocious invader, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains. Eventually, under the Ghurids, the Muslim army broke into the North Indian Plains, which lead to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206 by the slaves of the Ghurid dynasty. The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. However, internal squabbling resulted in the decline of the sultanate, and new Muslim sultanates such as the Bengal Sultanate in the east breaking off, while in the Deccan the Urdu-speaking colonists from Delhi, who carried the Urdu language to the Deccan, founded the Bahmanid Empire. In 1339, Shah Mir became the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir, inaugurating the Salatin-i-Kashmir or Shah Mir dynasty.
Under the Delhi Sultanate, there was a synthesis of Indian civilization with that of Islamic civilization, and the integration of the Indian subcontinent with a growing world system and wider international networks spanning large parts of Afro-Eurasia, which had a significant impact on Indian culture and society. The time period of their rule included the earliest forms of Indo-Islamic architecture, increased growth rates in India's population and economy, and the emergence of the Hindustani language. The Delhi Sultanate was also responsible for repelling the Mongol Empire's potentially devastating invasions of India in the 13th and 14th centuries. The period coincided with a greater use of mechanical technology in the Indian subcontinent. From the 13th century onwards, India began widely adopting mechanical technologies from the Islamic world, including water-raising wheels with gears and pulleys, machines with cams and cranks, papermaking technology, and the spinning wheel.

In the early 16th century, northern India, being then under mainly Muslim rulers, fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors. The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule, but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive ruling elites, leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule. Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status. The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency, caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets. The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion, resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture. The Mughal Empire was the world's largest economy in the 17th century, larger than Qing China and Western Europe, with Mughal India producing about a quarter of the world's economic and industrial output.
In the 18th century, Mughal power had become severely limited. By the mid-18th century, the Marathas had routed Mughal armies and invaded several Mughal provinces from the Punjab to Bengal. By this time, the dominant economic powers in the Indian subcontinent were Bengal Subah under the Nawabs of Bengal and the South Indian Kingdom of Mysore under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, before the former was devastated by the Maratha invasions of Bengal, leading to the economy of the Kingdom of Mysore overtaking Bengal. The British East India Company conquered Bengal in 1757 and then Mysore in the late 18th century. The last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah II, had authority over only the city of Old Delhi (Shahjahanabad), before he was exiled to Burma by the British Raj after the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

Role in the Indian independence movement
The contribution of Muslim revolutionaries, poets and writers is documented in the history of India's struggle for independence. Titumir raised a revolt against the British Raj. Abul Kalam Azad, Hakim Ajmal Khan and Rafi Ahmed Kidwai are other Muslims who engaged in this endeavour. Ashfaqulla Khan of Shahjahanpur conspired to loot the British treasury at Kakori(Lucknow) (See Kakori conspiracy). Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan (popularly known as ""Frontier Gandhi"") was a noted nationalist who spent 45 of his 95 years of life in jail; Barakatullah of Bhopal was one of the founders of the Ghadar Party, which created a network of anti-British organisations; Syed Rahmat Shah of the Ghadar Party worked as an underground revolutionary in France and was hanged for his part in the unsuccessful Ghadar Mutiny in 1915; Ali Ahmad Siddiqui of Faizabad (UP) planned the Indian Mutiny in Malaya and Burma, along with Syed Mujtaba Hussain of Jaunpur, and was hanged in 1917; Vakkom Abdul Khadir of Kerala participated in the ""Quit India"" struggle in 1942 and was hanged; Umar Subhani, an industrialist and millionaire from Bombay, provided Mahatma Gandhi with Congress expenses and ultimately died for the cause of independence. Among Muslim women, Hazrat Mahal, Asghari Begum, and Bi Amma contributed in the struggle for independence from the British.

Other famous Muslims who fought for independence against British rule were Abul Kalam Azad, Mahmud al-Hasan of Darul Uloom Deoband, who was implicated in the famous Silk Letter Movement to overthrow the British through an armed struggle, Husain Ahmad Madani, former Shaikhul Hadith of Darul Uloom Deoband, Ubaidullah Sindhi, Hakim Ajmal Khan, Hasrat Mohani, Syed Mahmud, Ahmadullah Shah, Professor Maulavi Barkatullah, Maghfoor Ahmad Ajazi, Zakir Husain, Saifuddin Kitchlew, Vakkom Abdul Khadir, Manzoor Abdul Wahab, Bahadur Shah Zafar, Hakeem Nusrat Husain, Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan, Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai, Colonel Shahnawaz, Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai, Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, Ansar Harwani, Tak Sherwani, Nawab Viqarul Mulk, Nawab Mohsinul Mulk, Mustsafa Husain, V. M. Obaidullah, S.R. Rahim, Badruddin Tyabji, Abid Hasan and Moulvi Abdul Hamid.
Until 1920, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, later the founder of Pakistan, was a member of the Indian National Congress and was part of the independence struggle. Muhammad Iqbal, poet and philosopher, was a strong proponent of Hindu–Muslim unity and an undivided India, perhaps until 1930. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy was also active in the Indian National Congress in Bengal, during his early political career. Mohammad Ali Jouhar and Shaukat Ali struggled for the emancipation of the Muslims in the overall Indian context, and struggled for independence alongside Mahatma Gandhi and Abdul Bari of Firangi Mahal. Until the 1930s, the Muslims of India broadly conducted their politics alongside their countrymen, in the overall context of an undivided India.

Partition of India
I find no parallel in history for a body of converts and their descendants claiming to be a nation apart from the parent stock.

The partition of British India led to the creation of the dominions of Pakistan (that later split into the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the People's Republic of Bangladesh) and India (later Republic of India). The Indian Independence Act 1947 had decided 15 August 1947, as the appointed date for the partition. However, Pakistan celebrates its day of creation on 14 August.
The partition of India was set forth in the Act and resulted in the dissolution of the British Indian Empire and the end of the British Raj. It resulted in a struggle between the newly constituted states of India and Pakistan and displaced up to 12.5 million people with estimates of loss of life varying from several hundred thousand to a million (most estimates of the numbers of people who crossed the boundaries between India and Pakistan in 1947 range between 10 and 12 million). The violent nature of the partition created an atmosphere of mutual hostility and suspicion between India and Pakistan that plagues their relationship to this day.

The partition included the geographical division of the Bengal province into East Bengal, which became part of Pakistan (from 1956, East Pakistan). West Bengal became part of India, and a similar partition of the Punjab province became West Punjab (later the Pakistani Punjab and Islamabad Capital Territory) and East Punjab (later the Indian Punjab, as well as Haryana and Himachal Pradesh).  The partition agreement also included the division of Indian government assets, including the Indian Civil Service, the Indian Army, the Royal Indian Navy, the Indian railways and the central treasury, and other administrative services.
The two self-governing countries of India and Pakistan legally came into existence at the stroke of midnight on 14–15 August 1947. The ceremonies for the transfer of power were held a day earlier in Karachi, at the time the capital of the new state of Pakistan, so that the last British Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten of Burma, could attend both the ceremony in Karachi and the ceremony in Delhi. Thus, Pakistan's Independence Day is celebrated on 14 August and India's on 15 August.
After Partition of India in 1947, two-thirds of the Muslims resided in Pakistan (both east and West Pakistan) but a third resided in India. Based on 1951 census of displaced persons, 7,226,000 Muslims went to Pakistan (both West and East) from India while 7,249,000 Hindus and Sikhs moved to India from Pakistan (both West and East). Some critics allege that British haste in the partition process increased the violence that followed. Because independence was declared prior to the actual Partition, it was up to the new governments of India and Pakistan to keep public order. No large population movements were contemplated; the plan called for safeguards for minorities on both sides of the new border. It was a task at which both states failed. There was a complete breakdown of law and order; many died in riots, massacre, or just from the hardships of their flight to safety. What ensued was one of the largest population movements in recorded history. According to Richard Symonds: At the lowest estimate, half a million people perished and twelve million became homeless.
However, many argue that the British were forced to expedite the Partition by events on the ground. Once in office, Mountbatten quickly became aware if Britain were to avoid involvement in a civil war, which seemed increasingly likely, there was no alternative to partition and a hasty exit from India. Law and order had broken down many times before Partition with much bloodshed on both sides. A massive civil war was looming by the time Mountbatten became Viceroy. After the Second World War, Britain had limited resources, perhaps insufficient to the task of keeping order. Another viewpoint is that while Mountbatten may have been too hasty he had no real options left and achieved the best he could under difficult circumstances. The historian Lawrence James concurs that in 1947 Mountbatten was left with no option but to cut and run. The alternative seemed to be involvement in a potentially bloody civil war from which it would be difficult to get out.

Demographics
With around 204 million Muslims (2019 estimate), India's Muslim population is the world's third-largest and the world's largest Muslim-minority population. India is home to 10.9% of the world's Muslim population.  Indian Muslims have a fertility rate of 2.36, the highest in the nation as per as according to year 2019-21 estimation. In 2023, the Government of India estimated the Muslim population at 19.75 to 20 crore, out of 138.8 to 140.0 crore total population, thus constituting around (14.22%–14.28%) of the nation's population.
Muslim populations (top 5 countries) Est. 2020

Muslims represent a majority of the local population in Lakshadweep (96.2%) and Jammu and Kashmir (68.3%). The largest concentration – about 47% of all Muslims in India, live in the three states of Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Bihar. High concentrations of Muslims are also found in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Delhi, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, and Uttarakhand.

Percentage by states
As of 2021, Muslims comprise the majority of the population in the only Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and in a Union territory Lakshadweep. In 110 minority-concentrated districts, at least a fifth of the population are Muslim.

Population growth rate
Region-wise distribution of Muslims leaving for Pakistan (1951 Census)   -

After India's Independence and the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the Muslim population in India declined from 42,400,000 (13.3%) in 1941 to 35,400,000 (9.8%) in the 1951 census due to the Partition of India. The Pakistan Census, 1951 identified the number of displaced persons in the country at 7,226,600, presumably all Muslims refugees who had entered Pakistan from India. Around 35 million Muslims stayed back after Partition as Jawaharlal Nehru (then the Prime Minister of India) have ensured the confidence that they would be treated fairly in this democratic nation.
In the 1941 Census, there were 94.5 million Muslims living in the Undivided India (inc. Pakistan and Bangladesh), comprising 24 percent of the population. Partition, in fact, has eventually drained India of 60% of its Muslim population respectively. 
Former Minister of Law and Justice of India, Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar during partition, have advocated for a full population exchange between the Muslim and Hindu minorities of India and Pakistan for maintenance of law, order and peace in both the newly formed nations by citing- ""That the transfer of minorities is the only lasting remedy for communal peace is beyond doubt"" in his own written book ""Pakistan or partition of India"" respectively.
However, a complete population exchange did not occur and was made impossible due to the earlier signing of the Liaquat–Nehru Pact in 1950, which sealed the borders of both nations completely. Ultimately, this led to the cessation of migration of refugees from both sides. As a result of this, a large number of Muslims in India, a significant number of Hindus in East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh) and a minuscule number of Hindus in the Sindh province of West Pakistan remained. Meanwhile, the East Punjab state of India and the West Punjab province of Pakistan saw a full population exchange between Muslim and Hindu/Sikh minorities during the time of Partition.

Illegal immigrants
India is the home of some 40,000 illegal Rohingya Muslim refugees, with approximately 18,000 registered with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). But even people with refugee cards are being detained across India due to security concerns. A small number of Uyghurs also reside in India, primarily in Jammu and Kashmir. Around 1,000 illegal Uyghur refugees arrived in India in 1949 to escape the communist regime. On 17 November 2016, Union Minister of State for Home, Kiren Rijiju, stated in the Rajya Sabha that, according to available inputs, there are around 20 million (2 crore) illegal Bangladeshi migrants staying in India. Illegal immigrants in Assam are estimated to number between 16 lakh and 84 lakh, in a total population of 3.12 crore according to the 2011 Census. A report published by DNA has revealed that the Bangladeshi-origin Muslim population has grown to 5–7% in bordering districts of Assam and Bengal simultaneously. Muminul Aowal, an eminent Assamese Muslim Minority Development Board Chairman, has reported that Assam has about 1.3 crore Muslims of which around 90 lakh are of Bangladeshi origin. According to Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, among the 19 lakh individuals excluded from the Assam National Register of Citizens, 7 lakh are Muslims. Dr. Kuntal Kanti Chattoraj, HOD of Geography at P.R.M.S. Mahavidyalaya, Bankura, estimates that around 6.28 million Bangladeshi Muslims have migrated to West Bengal over the decades.

Projections
Muslims in India have a much higher total fertility rate (TFR) compared to that of other religious communities in the country. Because of higher birthrates the percentage of Muslims in India has risen from about 9.8% in 1951 to 14.2% by 2011. However, since 1991, the largest decline in fertility rates among all religious groups in India has occurred among Muslims. The Sachar Committee Report shows that the Muslim Population Growth has slowed down and will be on par with national averages. The Sachar Committee Report estimated that the Muslim proportion will stabilise at between 17% and 21% of the Indian population by 2100. Pew Research Center have projected that India will have 311 million Muslims by 2050, out of total 1.668 billion people, thus constituting 18.4% of the country's population. The United Nations has projected India's population to rise to 170.53 crore by 2050, and then fall to 165.97 crore by 2100.

Religiosity
On 29 June 2021, Pew Research Center reports on Religiosity have been published, where they completed 29,999 face-to-face interviews with non-institutionalized adults ages 18 and older living in 26 states and three union territories across India. They interviewed 3,336 Muslims and found that 79% of those interviewed believed in the existence of God with absolute certainty, 12% believes in the existence of God with less certainty and 6% of the Indian Muslims have declared themselves as Atheists by citing that they don't believe in any God. However 91% of Muslim interviewed have said religion plays a big part in their lives.
CSDS study reports, have found that Indian Muslims have become ‘less religious’ since 2016. In that same year, the study founds that 97 per cent of Muslim respondents have said that they prayed regularly. However, in 2021, it was found that only 86 per cent of Muslim youth prayed regularly which is an absolute decline of 11 percentage points from the last five years respectively.
Social and economic reasons behind population growth

According to sociologists Roger and Patricia Jeffery, socio-economic factors, rather than religious determinism, play a more significant role in explaining the higher birthrates among Indian Muslims. Studies suggest that Muslims in India tend to have lower income levels and educational attainment compared to Hindus. However, B. K. Prasad, a noted Indian sociologist, highlights that due to the higher urbanization among Indian Muslims, their infant mortality rate is about 12% lower than that of Hindus.
However, some sociologists suggest that religious and cultural factors may also contribute to higher birthrates among Muslims in India. Surveys indicate that, on average, Muslim families are more traditional in their approach to family planning, and Muslim women tend to marry at a younger age compared to Hindu women, leading to a longer fertility period.
On the other hand, it is also documented that Muslims tend to adopt family planning measures. A study conducted by K. C. Zacharia in Kerala in 1983 revealed that on average, the number of children born to a Muslim woman was 4.1 while a Hindu woman gave birth to only 2.9 children. Religious customs and marriage practices were cited as some of the reasons behind the high Muslim birth rate. According to Paul Kurtz, Muslims in India are much more resistant to modern contraception than are Hindus and, as a consequence, the decline in fertility rate among Hindu women is much higher compared to that of Muslim women.
The National Family and Health survey conducted in 1998–99 highlighted that Indian Muslim couples consider a substantially higher number of children to be ideal for a family as compared to Hindu couples in India. The same survey also pointed out that percentage of couples actively using family planning measures was more than 49% among Hindus against 37% among Muslims. According to a district wise fertility study by Saswata Ghosh, Muslim TFR (total fertility rate) is closer to that of  the Hindu community in most southern states. Also TFR  tends to be high for both communities in Northern states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. This study was based on the last census of the country from 2011.

Denominations
There are two major denominations amongst Indian Muslims: Sunni and Shia. The majority of Indian Muslims (over 85%) belong to the Sunni branch of Islam, while a minority (over 13%) belong to the Shia branch.

Sunni
The majority of Indian Sunnis follow the Barelvi movement which was founded in 1904 by Ahmed Razi Khan of Bareilly in defense of traditional Islam as understood and practised in South Asia and in reaction to the revivalist attempts of the Deobandi movement. In the 19th century the Deobandi, a revivalist movement in Sunni Islam was established in India. It is named after Deoband a small town northeast of Delhi, where the original madrasa or seminary of the movement was founded. From its early days this movement has been influenced by Wahhabism. 
In the coastal Konkan region of Maharashtra, the local Konkani Muslims follow the Shafi'i school of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence.

Shia
Shia Muslims are a large minority among India's Muslims forming about 13% of the total Muslim population. However, there has been no particular census conducted in India regarding sects, but Indian sources like Times of India and Daily News and Analysis reported Indian Shia population in mid 2005–2006 to be up to 25% of the entire Muslim population of India which accounts them in numbers between 40,000,000 to 50,000,000 of 157,000,000 Indian Muslim population. However, as per an estimation of one reputed Shia NGO Alimaan Trust, India's Shia population in early 2000 was around 30 million with Sayyids comprising just a tenth of the Shia population. According to some national and international sources Indian Shia population is the world's second-largest after Iran.

Bohra
Bohra Shia was established in Gujarat in the second half of the 11th century. This community's belief system originates in Yemen, evolved from the Fatimid were persecuted due to their adherence to Fatimid Shia Islam –  leading the shift of Dawoodi Bohra to India. After occultation of their 21st Fatimid Imam Tayyib, they follow Dai as representative of Imam which are continued till date.
Dā'ī Zoeb appointed Maulai Yaqoob (after the death of Maulai Abdullah), who was the second Walī al-Hind of the Fatimid dawat. Moulai Yaqoob was the first person of Indian origin to receive this honour under the Dā'ī. He was the son of Moulai Bharmal, minister of Hindu Solanki King Jayasimha Siddharaja (Anhalwara, Patan). With Minister Moulai Tarmal, they had honoured the Fatimid dawat along with their fellow citizens on the call of Moulai Abdullah. Syedi Fakhruddin, son of Moulai Tarmal, was sent to western Rajasthan, India, and Moulai Nuruddin went to the Deccan (death: Jumadi al-Ula 11 at Don Gaum, Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India).
One Dai succeeded another until the 23rd Dai in Yemen. In India also Wali-ul-Hind were appointed by them one after another until Wali-ul-Hind Moulai Qasim Khan bin Hasan (11th and last Wali-ul-Hind, d. 950 AH, Ahmedabad).
Due to persecution by the local Zaydi Shi'a ruler in Yemen, the 24th Dai, Yusuf Najmuddin ibn Sulaiman (d. 1567 CE), moved the whole administration of the Dawat (mission) to India. The 25th Dai Jalal Shamshuddin (d. 1567 CE) was first dai to die in India. His mausoleum is in Ahmedabad, India. The Dawat subsequently moved from Ahmedabad to Jamnagar Mandvi, Burhanpur, Surat and finally to Mumbai and continues there to the present day, currently headed by 53rd Dai.
Asaf Ali Asghar Fyzee was a Bohra and 20th century Islamic scholar from India who promoted modernization and liberalization of Islam through his writings. He argued that with changing time modern reforms in Islam are necessary without compromising on basic ""spirit of Islam"".

Khojas
The Khojas are a group of diverse people who converted to Islam in South Asia. In India, most Khojas live in the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and the city of Hyderabad. Many Khojas have also migrated and settled over the centuries in East Africa, Europe, and North America. The Khoja were by then adherents of Nizari Ismailism branch of Shi'ism. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the aftermath of the Aga Khan case, a significant minority separated and adopted Twelver Shi'ism or Sunni Islam, while the majority remained Nizārī Ismā'īlī.

Sufis
Sufis (Islamic mystics) played an important role in the spread of Islam in India. They were very successful in spreading Islam, as many aspects of Sufi belief systems and practices had their parallels in Indian philosophical literature, in particular nonviolence and monism. The Sufis' orthodox approach towards Islam made it easier for Hindus to practice. Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed, Hazrat Khawaja Muin-ud-din Chishti, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki, Nizamuddin Auliya, Shah Jalal, Amir Khusrow, Alauddin Sabir Kaliyari, Shekh Alla-ul-Haq Pandwi, Ashraf Jahangir Semnani, Waris Ali Shah, Ata Hussain Fani Chishti trained Sufis for the propagation of Islam in different parts of India. The Sufi movement also attracted followers from the artisan and untouchable communities; they played a crucial role in bridging the distance between Islam and the indigenous traditions. Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent member of the Naqshbandi Sufi advocated the peaceful conversion of Hindus to Islam.

Ahmadiyya
The Ahmadiyya movement was founded in 1889 by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian. He claimed to be the promised messiah and mahdi awaited by the Muslims and obtained a considerable number of followers initially within the United Provinces, the Punjab and Sindh. Ahmadis claim the Ahmadiyya movement to embody the latter day revival of Islam and the movement has also been seen to have emerged as an Islamic religious response to the Christian and Arya Samaj missionary activity that was widespread in 19th century India. After the death of Ghulam Ahmad, his successors directed the Ahmadiyya Community from Qadian which remained the headquarters of the community until 1947 with the creation of Pakistan. The movement has grown in organisational strength and in its own missionary programme and has expanded to over 200 countries as of 2014 but has received a largely negative response from mainstream Muslims who see it as heretical, due mainly to Ghulam Ahmad's claim to be a prophet within Islam.
Ahmaddiya have been identified as sects of Islam in 2011 Census of India apart from Sunnis, Shias, Bohras and Agakhanis. India has a significant Ahmadiyya population. Most of them live in Rajasthan, Odisha, Haryana, Bihar, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and a few in Punjab in the area of Qadian. In India, Ahmadis are considered to be Muslims by the Government of India (unlike in neighbouring Pakistan). This recognition is supported by a court verdict (Shihabuddin Koya vs. Ahammed Koya, A.I.R. 1971 Ker 206). There is no legislation that declares Ahmadis non-Muslims or limits their activities, but they are not allowed to sit on the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, a body of religious leaders India's government recognises as representative of Indian Muslims. Ahmadiyya are estimated to be from 60,000 to 1 million in India.

Quranists
Non-sectarian Muslims who reject the authority of hadith, known as Quranists, Quraniyoon, or Ahle Quran, are also present in India. In South Asia during the 19th century, the Ahle Quran movement formed partially in reaction to the Ahle Hadith movement whom they considered to be placing too much emphasis on hadith. Notable Indian Quranists include Chiragh Ali, Aslam Jairajpuri, Khwaja Kamal-ud-Din, and Abdullah Chakralawi.

Islamic traditions in India
Sufism is a mystical dimension of Islam, often complementary with the legalistic path of the sharia had a profound impact on the growth of Islam in India. A Sufi attains a direct vision of oneness with God, often on the edges of orthodox behaviour, and can thus become a Pir (living saint) who may take on disciples (murids) and set up a spiritual lineage that can last for generations. Orders of Sufis became important in India during the thirteenth century following the ministry of Moinuddin Chishti (1142–1236), who settled in Ajmer and attracted large numbers of converts to Islam because of his holiness. His Chishti Order went on to become the most influential Sufi lineage in India, although other orders from Central Asia and Southwest Asia also reached India and played a major role in the spread of Islam. In this way, they created a large literature in regional languages that embedded Islamic culture deeply into older South Asian traditions.

Intra-Muslim relations
Shia–Sunni relations
The Sunnis and Shia are the biggest Muslim groups by denomination. Although the two groups remain cordial, there have been instances of conflict between the two groups, especially in the city of Lucknow.

Society and culture
Religious administration
The religious administration of each state is headed by the Mufti of the State under the supervision of the Grand Mufti of India, the most senior, most influential religious authority and spiritual leader of Muslims in India. The system is executed in India from the Mughal period.

Leadership and organisations
The Ajmer Sharif Dargah and Dargah-e-Ala Hazrat at Bareilly Shareef are prime center of Sufi oriented Sunni Muslims of India.
Indian Shia Muslims form a substantial minority within the Muslim community of India comprising between 25 and 31% of total Muslim population in an estimation done during mid-2005 to 2006 of the then Indian Muslim population of 157 million. Sources like The Times of India and DNA reported Indian Shia population during that period between 40,000,000 to 50,000,000 of 157,000,000 Indian Muslim population.
The Deobandi movement, another section of the Sunni Muslim population, originate from the Darul Uloom Deoband, an influential religious seminary in the district of Saharanpur of Uttar Pradesh. The Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, founded by Deobandi scholars in 1919, became a political mouthpiece for the Darul Uloom.
The Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, founded in 1941, advocates the establishment of an Islamic government and has been active in promoting education, social service and ecumenical outreach to the community.

Caste system among Indian Muslims
Although Islam requires egalitarianism and is against discrimination based on caste, creed or race, the caste system among have developed among some Indian Muslims that deals with units of social stratification.
Some Muslim scholars have tried to reconcile and resolve the ""disjunction between Quranic egalitarianism and Indian Muslim social practice"" through theorizing it in different ways and interpreting the Quran and Sharia to justify casteism.

Stratification
In parts of South Asia, Muslims are categorized into groups like Ashrafs and Ajlafs. Ashrafs often claim foreign ancestry and are divided into various occupational castes. Historian Ziauddin Barani emphasized caste distinctions, advocating higher status for the ""sons of Muhammad"" (Sayyids) and proposing that state laws (zawabi) enforce these divisions, even over Sharia in some cases. He attributed ""ignoble"" professions to the Ajlaf and sought religious endorsement for this hierarchy. Barani also developed a caste-based framework for appointing and promoting imperial officers (wazirs).
Beyond the Ashraf/Ajlaf divide, the Arzal caste represents groups associated with professions deemed menial, such as waste disposal. Anti-caste activist Babasaheb Ambedkar likened the Arzal to untouchables. The term ""Arzal,"" meaning ""degraded,"" encompasses subdivisions like the Bhanar, Halalkhor, Hijra, Kasbi, Lalbegi, Maugta, and Mehtar, reflecting the persistence of caste-based stratification in parts of the Muslim community.
South Asian Muslims have also been known to organize their society through qaums or communal groups. Studies of Bengali Muslims in India reveal that notions of purity and impurity continue to influence inter-group relationships, with social status often tied to perceived cleanliness rather than economic conditions. Among Indian Muslims, there are also distinctions like the Muslim Rajputs, as well as upper and middle-caste communities such as Syed, Shaikh, Shaikhzada, Khanzada, Pathan, Mughal, and Malik. Genetic data has also supported this stratification. Genetic studies of South Asian Muslims have supported the existence of these stratifications, showing that their genetic makeup closely resembles that of local non-Muslims, with small but notable influences from Iran and Central Asia rather than the Arabian Peninsula.
Some scholars argue that caste discrimination among Muslims is less severe than in Hindu society, but Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar disagreed, claiming that social injustices within Muslim society were ""worse than those seen in Hindu society."" He criticized the Ashraf community for their hostility towards the Ajlaf and Arzal groups and condemned the Muslim community for failing to implement needed reforms.

Interaction and mobility
Data indicates that the castes among Muslims have never been as rigid as that among Hindus. They have good interactions with the other communities. They participate in marriages and funerals and other religious and social events in other communities. Some of them also had inter-caste marriages since centuries but mostly they preferred to marry in the same caste with a significant number of marriages being consanguineous. In Bihar state of India, cases had been reported in which the higher caste Muslims have opposed the burials of lower caste Muslims in the same graveyard.

He criticized the Ashraf community for their hostility towards the Ajlaf and Arzal groups.

Segregation
Segregation of Indian Muslims from other communities began in the mid-1970s when the first communal riots occurred. This was heightened after the 1989 Bhagalpur violence in Bihar and became a trend after the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992. Soon several major cities developed ghettos, or segregated areas, where the Muslim population moved into. This trend, however, did not help with the anticipated security the anonymity of ghetto was thought to have provided. During the 2002 Gujarat riots, several such ghettos became easy targets for the rioting mobs, as they enabled the profiling of residential colonies. This kind of ghettoisation can be seen in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and many cities of Gujarat where a clear socio-cultural demarcation exists between Hindu-dominated and Muslim-dominated neighbourhoods.
In places like Gujarat, riots and alienation of Muslims have led to large-scale ghettoisation of the community. For example, the Juhapura area of Ahmadabad has swelled from 250,000 to 650,000 residents since 2002 riots. Muslims in Gujarat have no option but to head to a ghetto, irrespective of their economic and professional status.
An increase in ghetto living has also shown a strengthening of stereotyping due to a lack of cross-cultural interaction, and reduction in economic and educational opportunities at large. Secularism in India is being seen by some as a favour to the Muslims, and not an imperative for democracy.

Consanguineous marriages
The NFHS (National Family Health Survey) on 1992-93 showed that 22 per cent of marriages in India were consanguineous, with the highest per cent recorded in Jammu and Kashmir, a Muslim majority state. Post partition percentage of consanguineous marriages in Delhi Sunni Muslims has risen to 37.84 per cent. As per Nasir, such unions are perceived to be exploitative as they perpetuate the existing power structures within the family.

Art and architecture
Architecture of India took new shape with the advent of Islamic rule in India towards the end of the 12th century CE. New elements were introduced into the Indian architecture that include: use of shapes (instead of natural forms); inscriptional art using decorative lettering or calligraphy; inlay decoration and use of coloured marble, painted plaster and brightly coloured glazed tiles. Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque built in 1193 CE was the first mosque to be built in the Indian subcontinent; its adjoining ""Tower of Victory"", the Qutb Minar also started around 1192 CE, which marked the victory of Muhammad of Ghor and his general Qutb al-Din Aibak, from Ghazni, Afghanistan, over local Rajput kings, is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Delhi.
In contrast to the indigenous Indian architecture which was of the trabeate order, i.e. all spaces were spanned by means of horizontal beams, the Islamic architecture was arcuate, i.e. an arch or dome was adopted as a method of bridging a space. The concept of arch or dome was not invented by the Muslims but was, in fact, borrowed and further perfected by them from the architectural styles of the post-Roman period. Muslims used a cementing agent in the form of mortar for the first time in the construction of buildings in India. They further put to use certain scientific and mechanical formulae, which were derived by experience of other civilisations, in their constructions in India. Such use of scientific principles helped not only in obtaining greater strength and stability of the construction materials but also provided greater flexibility to the architects and builders. One fact that must be stressed here is that, the Islamic elements of architecture had already passed through different experimental phases in other countries like Egypt, Iran and Iraq before these were introduced in India. Unlike most Islamic monuments in these countries, which were largely constructed in brick, plaster and rubble, the Indo-Islamic monuments were typical mortar-masonry works formed of dressed stones. It must be emphasized that the development of the Indo-Islamic architecture was greatly facilitated by the knowledge and skill possessed by the Indian craftsmen, who had mastered the art of stonework for centuries and used their experience while constructing Islamic monuments in India.
Islamic architecture in India can be divided into two parts: religious and secular. Mosques and Tombs represent the religious architecture, while palaces and forts are examples of secular Islamic architecture. Forts were essentially functional, complete with a little township within and various fortifications to engage and repel the enemy.

Mosques
There are more than 300,000 active mosques in India, which is higher than any other country, including the Muslim world. The mosque or masjid is a representation of Muslim art in its simplest form. The mosque is basically an open courtyard surrounded by a pillared verandah, crowned off with a dome. A mihrab indicates the direction of the qibla for prayer. Towards the right of the mihrab stands the minbar or pulpit from where the Imam presides over the proceedings. An elevated platform, usually a minaret from where the Faithful are summoned to attend prayers is an invariable part of a mosque. Large mosques where the faithful assemble for the Friday prayers are called the Jama Masjids.

Tombs and mausoleum
The tomb or maqbara could range from being a simple affair (Aurangazeb's grave) to an awesome structure enveloped in grandeur (Taj Mahal). The tomb usually consists of a solitary compartment or tomb chamber known as the huzrah in whose centre is the cenotaph or zarih. This entire structure is covered with an elaborate dome. In the underground chamber lies the mortuary or the maqbara, in which the corpse is buried in a grave or qabr. Smaller tombs may have a mihrab, although larger mausoleums have a separate mosque located at a distance from the main tomb. Normally the whole tomb complex or rauza is surrounded by an enclosure. The tomb of a Muslim saint is called a dargah. Almost all Islamic monuments were subjected to free use of verses from the Quran and a great amount of time was spent in carving out minute details on walls, ceilings, pillars and domes.

Styles of Islamic architecture in India
Islamic architecture in India can be classified into three sections: Delhi or the imperial style (1191–1557 CE); the provincial style, encompassing the surrounding areas like Ahmedabad, Jaunpur and the Deccan; and the Mughal architecture style (1526–1707 CE).

Law, politics, and government
Certain civil matters of jurisdiction for Muslims such as marriage, inheritance and waqf properties are governed by the Muslim Personal Law, which was developed during British rule and subsequently became part of independent India with some amendments. Indian Muslim personal law is not developed as a Sharia law but as an interpretation of existing Muslim laws as part of common law. The Supreme Court of India has ruled that Sharia or Muslim law holds precedence for Muslims over Indian civil law in such matters.
Muslims in India are governed by ""The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937."" It directs the application of Muslim Personal Law to Muslims in marriage, mahr (dower), divorce, maintenance, gifts, waqf, wills and inheritance. The courts generally apply the Hanafi Sunni law for Sunnis; Shia Muslims are independent of Sunni law for those areas where Shia law differs substantially from Sunni practice.
The Indian constitution provides equal rights to all citizens irrespective of their religion. Article 44 of the constitution recommends a uniform civil code. However, attempts by successive political leadership in the country to integrate Indian society under a common civil code is strongly resisted and is viewed by Indian Muslims as an attempt to dilute the cultural identity of the minority groups of the country. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board was established for the protection and continued applicability of ""Muslim Personal Law"", i.e. Shariat Application Act in India. The Sachar Committee was asked to report about the condition of Muslims in India in 2005. Almost all the recommendations of the Sachar Committee have been implemented.
The following laws/acts of Indian legislation are applicable to Muslims in India (except in the state of Goa) regarding matters of marriage, succession, inheritance, child adoption etc.

Muslim Personal Law Sharia Application Act, 1937
The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939
Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986
Note: the above laws are not applicable in the state of Goa. The Goa civil code, also called the Goa Family Law, is the set of civil laws that governs the residents of the Indian state of Goa. In India, as a whole, there are religion-specific civil codes that separately govern adherents of different religions. Goa is an exception to that rule, in that a single secular code/law governs all Goans, irrespective of religion, ethnicity or linguistic affiliation. The above laws are also not applicable to Muslims throughout India who had civil marriages under the Special Marriage Act, 1954.
Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan is an Indian Muslim women's organisation in India. It released a draft on 23 June 2014, 'Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act', recommending that polygamy be made illegal in the Muslim Personal Law of India.
Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 was proposed for the changes in the citizenship and immigration norms of the country by relaxing the requirements for Indian citizenship. The applicability of the amendments are debated in news as it is on religious lines (excluding Muslims).
India's Constitution and Parliament have protected the rights of Muslims but, according to some sources, there has been a growth in a 'climate of fear' and 'targeting of dissenters' under the Bharatiya Janata Party and Modi ministry, affecting the feelings of security and tolerance amongst Indian Muslims. However, these allegations are not universally supported.

Muslims in government
India has seen three Muslim presidents and many chief ministers of State Governments have been Muslims. Apart from that, there are and have been many Muslim ministers, both at the centre and at the state level. Out of the 12 Presidents of the Republic of India, three were Muslims – Zakir Husain, Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed and A. P. J. Abdul Kalam. Additionally, Mohammad Hidayatullah, Aziz Mushabber Ahmadi, Mirza Hameedullah Beg and Altamas Kabir held the office of the Chief Justice of India on various occasions since independence. Mohammad Hidayatullah also served as the acting President of India on two separate occasions; and holds the distinct honour of being the only person to have served in all three offices of the President of India, the Vice-President of India and the Chief Justice of India.
The former Vice-President of India, Mohammad Hamid Ansari, former Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid and former Director (Head) of the Intelligence Bureau, Syed Asif Ibrahim are Muslims. Ibrahim was the first Muslim to hold this office. From 30 July 2010 to 10 June 2012, Dr. S. Y. Quraishi served as the Chief Election Commissioner of India. He was the first Muslim to serve in this position. Prominent Indian bureaucrats and diplomats include Abid Hussain, Ali Yavar Jung and Asaf Ali. Zafar Saifullah was Cabinet Secretary of the Government of India from 1993 to 1994. Salman Haidar was the Foreign Secretary from 1995 to 1997 and Deputy Permanent Representative of India to the United Nations. Tayyab Husain was the only politician in Indian history to serve as a Cabinet Minister in the government of three different states at different times. (Undivided Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana). Influential Muslim politicians in India include Sheikh Abdullah, Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah (former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir), Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, Mehbooba Mufti, Chaudhary Rahim Khan, Sikander Bakht, A. R. Antulay, Ahmed Patel, C. H. Mohammed Koya, A. B. A. Ghani Khan Choudhury, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Salman Khurshid, Saifuddin Soz, E. Ahamed, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Syed Shahnawaz Hussain, Asaduddin Owaisi, Azam Khan and Badruddin Ajmal, Najma Heptulla.

Haj subsidy
The government of India subsidized the cost of the airfare for Indian Hajj pilgrims until it was totally phased out in 2018. The decision to end the subsidy was in order to comply with a Supreme Court of India decision of 2011. Starting in 2011, the amount of government subsidy per person was decreased year on year and  ended completely by 2018. Maulana Mahmood A. Madani, a member of the Rajya Sabha and general secretary of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, declared that the Hajj subsidy is a technical violation of Islamic Sharia, since the Quran declares that Hajj should be performed by Muslims using their own resources. Influential Muslim lobbies in India have regularly insisted that the Hajj subsidy should be phased out as it is un-Islamic.

Conflict and controversy
Conversion controversy
Considerable controversy exists both in scholarly and public opinion about the conversions to Islam typically represented by the following schools of thought:

The bulk of Muslims are descendants of migrants from the Iranian Plateau or Arabs. However this claim is disputed by modern genetic studies on haplotype findings of Y-chromosomal ancestry amongst various Muslim communities in India.
Conversions of convenience: administrators and clerks converted to preserve their employment by governments; slaves obtained protection, and sometimes even power, through conversion; sub-castes converted to gain a Muslim ruler's protection; in many service industries (e.g. butchery) conversion was socially convenient; non-Muslim men converted to marry Muslim women.
Conversions occurred for non-religious reasons of pragmatism and patronage such as social mobility among the Muslim ruling elite or for relief from taxes
Conversion was a result of the actions of Sunni Sufi saints and involved a genuine change of heart.
Conversion came from Buddhists and the en masse conversions of lower castes for social liberation and as a rejection of the oppressive Hindu caste strictures.
A combination, initially made under duress followed by a genuine change of heart.
As a socio-cultural process of diffusion and integration over an extended period of time into the sphere of the dominant Muslim civilisation and global polity at large.
Embedded within this lies the concept of Islam as a foreign imposition and Hinduism as the native religion that resisted it has been a point of contention, contributing to the failure of efforts to Islamize the Indian subcontinent and playing a significant role in the politics of partition and communalism. The impact and consequences of the Muslim conquest of South Asia remain subjects of scrutiny and diverse viewpoints.
Will Durant characterizes the Muslim conquest of India as a particularly tumultuous chapter in history. He suggests that it was marked by significant violence and upheaval, which he attributes in part to factors such as internal divisions, the influence of religions like Buddhism and Jainism. Jadunath Sarkar argues that some Muslim invaders waged a systematic jihad against Hindus, using various methods to force conversions. Hindu converts to Islam faced discrimination within the Muslim social hierarchy, as outlined in Ziauddin al-Barani’s Fatawa-i Jahandari, where they were placed in the Ajlaf caste and treated as inferior to the Ashraf castes. Other perspectives suggest that the Muslim conquests led to persecution of Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists, with instances of massacres, temple destructions, and forced conversions.
Sir Thomas Arnold and De Lacy O'Leary, criticized the view that Islam was spread by force and sword as 'absurd.' According to Ira Lapidus, while instances of forced conversion in Muslim regions did occur, they were relatively infrequent. Muslim conquerors generally sought to exert control rather than enforce conversion, with the majority of conversions to Islam being voluntary in nature. 
Other critics of the ""conversion by the sword theory"" point to the presence of the large Muslim communities found in Southern India, Sri Lanka, Western Burma, Bangladesh, Southern Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia coupled with the distinctive lack of equivalent Muslim communities around the heartland of historical Muslim empires in the Indian subcontinent as a refutation to the ""conversion by the sword theory"". The legacy of the Muslim conquest of South Asia is a hotly debated issue and argued even today.
Muslim invaders were not all simply raiders. Later rulers fought on to win kingdoms and stayed to create new ruling dynasties. The practices of these new rulers and their subsequent heirs (some of whom were born to Hindu wives) varied considerably. While some were uniformly hated, others developed a popular following. According to the memoirs of Ibn Battuta who travelled through Delhi in the 14th century, one of the previous sultans had been especially brutal and was deeply hated by Delhi's population. Batuta's memoirs also indicate that Muslims from the Arab world, Persia and Anatolia were often favoured with important posts at the royal courts, suggesting that locals may have played a somewhat subordinate role in the Delhi administration. The term ""Turk"" was commonly used to refer to their higher social status. S.A.A. Rizvi (The Wonder That Was India – II) however points to Muhammad bin Tughluq as not only encouraging locals but promoting artisan groups such as cooks, barbers and gardeners to high administrative posts. In his reign, it is likely that conversions to Islam took place as a means of seeking greater social mobility and improved social standing.
Although, the Mughals were generally known for their religious tolerance, and actively patronized the arts and literature as well as cultural and religious exchange, blending Hindu and Islamic traditions, numerous temples were destroyed by Muslim conquerors like Aurangzeb who was noted for his policies of religious intolerance non-Muslims.
Richard M. Eaton lists a total of 80 temples that were desecrated by Muslim conquerors, but notes this was not unusual in medieval India where numerous temples were also desecrated by Hindu and Buddhist kings against rival Indian kingdoms during conflicts between devotees of different Hindu deities, and between Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. He also notes there were many instances of the Delhi Sultanate, which often had Hindu ministers, ordering the protection, maintenance and repairing of temples, according to both Muslim and Hindu sources, and that attacks on temples had significantly declined under the Mughal Empire.
K. S. Lal, in his book Growth of Muslim Population in Medieval India, claimed that between 1000 and 1500 the Indian population decreased by 30 million, but stated his estimates were tentative and did not claim any finality. His work has come under criticism by historians such as Simon Digby (SOAS, University of London) and Irfan Habib for its agenda and lack of accurate data in pre-census times. Different population estimates by economics historians Angus Maddison and Jean-Noël Biraben also indicate that India's population did not decrease between 1000 and 1500, but increased by about 35 million during that time. The Indian population estimates from other economic historians including Colin Clark, John D. Durand and Colin McEvedy also show there was a population increase in India between 1000 and 1500.

Relations with non-Muslim communities
Muslim–Hindu conflict
Before 1947
The conflict between Hindus and Muslims in the Indian subcontinent has a complex history which can be said to have begun with the Umayyad Caliphate's invasion of Sindh in 711. The persecution of Hindus during the Islamic expansion in India during the medieval period was characterised by destruction of temples, often illustrated by historians by the repeated destruction of the Hindu Temple at Somnath and the anti-Hindu practices of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. Although there were instances of conflict between the two groups, a number of Hindus worshipped and continue to worship at the tombs of Muslim Sufi Saints. During the Noakhali riots in 1946, several thousand Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam by Muslim mobs.

From 1947 to 1998
The aftermath of the Partition of India in 1947 saw large scale sectarian strife and bloodshed throughout the nation. Since then, India has witnessed sporadic large-scale violence sparked by underlying tensions between sections of the Hindu and Muslim communities. These include the 1969 Gujarat riots, the 1970 Bhiwandi riots, the 1983 Nellie massacre, and the 1989 Bhagalpur violence. These conflicts stem in part from the ideologies of Hindu nationalism and Islamic extremism. Since independence, India has always maintained a constitutional commitment to secularism.
The sense of communal harmony between Hindus and Muslims in the post-partition period was compromised greatly by the razing of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya. The demolition took place in 1992 and was perpetrated by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and organisations like Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Bajrang Dal, Vishva Hindu Parishad and Shiv Sena. This was followed by tit for tat violence by Muslim and Hindu fundamentalists throughout the country, giving rise to the Bombay riots and the 1993 Bombay bombings.
In the 1998 Prankote massacre, 26 Kashmiri Hindus were beheaded by Islamist militants after their refusal to convert to Islam. The militants struck when the villagers refused demands from the gunmen to convert to Islam and prove their conversion by eating beef.

Kashmir (1990s)
During the eruption of militancy in the 1990s, following persecution and threats by radical Islamists and militants, the native Kashmiri Hindus were forced into an exodus from Kashmir, a Muslim-majority region in Northern India. Mosques issued warnings, telling them to leave Kashmir, convert to Islam or be killed. Approximately 300,000–350,000 pandits left the valley during the mid-80s and the 90s. Many of them have been living in abject conditions in refugee camps of Jammu.

Gujarat (2002)
One of the most violent events in recent times took place during the Gujarat riots in 2002, where it is estimated one thousand people were killed, most allegedly Muslim. Some sources claim there were approximately 2,000 Muslim deaths. There were also allegations made of state involvement. The riots were in retaliation to the Godhra train burning in which 59 Hindu pilgrims returning from the disputed site of the Babri Masjid, were burnt alive in a train fire at the Godhra railway station. Gujarat police claimed that the incident was a planned act carried out by extremist Muslims in the region against the Hindu pilgrims. The Bannerjee commission appointed to investigate this finding declared that the fire was an accident. In 2006 the High Court decided the constitution of such a committee was illegal as another inquiry headed by Justice Nanavati Shah was still investigating the matter.

In 2004, several Indian school textbooks were scrapped by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) after they were found to be loaded with anti-Muslim prejudice. The NCERT argued that the books were ""written by scholars hand-picked by the previous Hindu nationalist administration"". According to The Guardian, the textbooks depicted India's past Muslim rulers ""as barbarous invaders and the medieval period as a Dark Age of Islamic colonial rule which snuffed out the glories of the Hindu empire that preceded it"". In one textbook, it was purported that the Taj Mahal, the Qutb Minar and the Red Fort – all examples of Islamic architecture – ""were designed and commissioned by Hindus"".

West Bengal (2010)
In the 2010 Deganga riots, rioting began on 6 September 2010, when an Islamist mob resorted to arson and violence on the Hindu neighborhoods of Deganga, Kartikpur and Beliaghata under the Deganga police station area. The violence began late in the evening and continued throughout the night into the next morning. The district police, Rapid Action Force, Central Reserve Police Force and Border Security Force all failed to stop the mob violence and the Army was finally deployed.

Assam (2012)
At least 77 people died and 400,000 people were displaced in the 2012 Assam violence between indigenous Bodos and East Bengal rooted Muslims.

Delhi (2020)
The 2020 Delhi riots, which left more than 50 dead and hundreds injured, were triggered by protests against a citizenship law seen by many critics as anti-Muslim and part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist agenda.

Muslim–Sikh conflict
Sikhism emerged in the Punjab during the Mughal period. Conflict between early Sikhs and the Muslim power center at Delhi reached an early high point in 1606 when Guru Arjan, the fifth guru of the Sikhs, was tortured and killed by Jahangir, the Mughal emperor. After the death of the fifth beloved Guru his son took his spot as Guru Hargobind, who basically made the Sikhs a warrior religion. Guru ji was the first to defeat the Mughal empire in a battle which had taken place in present Sri Hargobindpur in Gurdaspur Later in the 16th century, Tegh Bahadur became guru in 1665 and led the Sikhs until 1675. Teg Bahadur was executed by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb for helping to protect Hindus, after a delegation of Kashmiri Pandits came to him for help when the Emperor condemned them to death for failing to convert to Islam. At this point, Aurangzeb had instituted forceful conversions on the basis of charging citizens with crimes then sparing them from punishments (up to death) if they converted. This led to a high increase of violence between the Sikhs and Hindus as well as rebellions in Aurangzeb's empire. This is an early example which illustrates how the Hindu-Muslim conflict and the Muslim-Sikh conflicts are connected. After this Guru Gobind Singh and the Sikhs helped the next successor of the throne of India to rise, who was Bahadur Shah Zafar. For a certain period of time good relations were maintained somewhat like they were in Akbar's time until disputes arose again. The Mughal period saw various invaders coming into India through Punjab with which they would loot and severely plunder. Better relations have been seen by Dulla Bhatti, Mian Mir, Pir Budhu Shah, Pir Bhikham Shah, Bulleh Shah.
In 1699, the Khalsa was founded by Guru Gobind Singh, the last guru. A former ascetic was charged by Gobind Singh with the duty of punishing those who had persecuted the Sikhs. After the guru's death, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur became the leader of the Sikh army and was responsible for several attacks on the Mughal empire. He was executed by the emperor Jahandar Shah after refusing the offer of a pardon if he converted to Islam. The decline of Mughal power during the 17th and 18th centuries, along with the growing strength of the Sikh Empire, resulted in a balance of power which protected the Sikhs from more violence. The Sikh empire was absorbed into the British Indian empire after the Second Anglo-Sikh War of 1849.
Massive population exchanges took place during the Partition of India in 1947, and the British Indian province of Punjab was divided into two parts, where the western parts were assigned to Pakistan, while the eastern parts went to India. 5.3 million Muslims moved from India to West Punjab in Pakistan, as 3.4 million Hindus and Sikhs moved from Pakistan to East Punjab in India. The newly formed governments were completely unequipped to deal with migrations of such staggering magnitude, and massive violence and slaughter occurred on both sides of the border. Estimates of the number of deaths range around roughly 500,000, with low estimates at 200,000 and high estimates at 1,000,000.

Prominent Muslims in India
India is home to many eminent Muslims who have made their mark in numerous fields and have played a constructive role in India's economic rise and cultural influence across the world.
Out of the 12 Presidents of the Republic of India, three were Muslims – Zakir Husain, Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed and A. P. J. Abdul Kalam. Additionally, 4 Muslims: Mohammad Hidayatullah, Aziz Mushabber Ahmadi, Mirza Hameedullah Beg and Altamas Kabir held the office of the Chief Justice of India.

India is home to several influential Muslim businessmen. Some of India's most prominent firms, such as Wipro, Wockhardt, Himalaya Health Care, Hamdard Laboratories, Cipla and Mirza Tanners were founded by Muslims. The only two South Asian Muslim billionaires named by Forbes magazine, Yusuf Hamied and Azim Premji, are from India.
Though Muslims are under-represented in the Indian Armed Forces, as compared to Hindus and Sikhs, several Indian military Muslim personnel have earned gallantry awards and high ranks for exceptional service to the nation. Air Chief Marshal I. H. Latif was Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (India) during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 and later served as Chief of the Air staff of the Indian Air Force from 1973 to 1976. Air Marshal Jaffar Zaheer (1923–2008) commanded IAF Agra and was decorated for his service during the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War, eventually rising to the rank of air marshal and ending his career as Director-General of Civil Aviation from 1979 to 1980. Indian Army's Abdul Hamid was posthumously awarded India's highest military decoration, the Param Vir Chakra, for knocking-out seven Pakistani tanks with a recoilless gun during the Battle of Asal Uttar in 1965.

Ancient period
Apostolic age
St Thomas
According to the tradition of Saint Thomas Christians, Thomas the Apostle came to Kodungallur (Cranganore) in the present day Kerala in 52 AD, and established the Ezharappallikal (Seven Churches) in or near ancient Jewish colonies by preaching among local Jews and Brahmins. According to St Thomas Christian tradition, Thomas the Apostle did the first baptism in India at St Thomas Syro-Malabar Church, Palayur, this church is therefore considered an Apostolic See credited to the apostolate of Thomas. After some years of evangelisation in South India, Thomas was martyred at the St Thomas Mount in Chennai (Madras) in AD 72. The neo-Gothic Cathedral Basilica of San Thome now stands on the site of his martyrdom and burial. A historically more likely claim by Eusebius of Caesarea is that Pantaenus, the head of the Christian exegetical school in Alexandria, Egypt went to India in AD 190 and found Christians already living in India using a version of the Gospel of Matthew with ""Hebrew letters, a mixture of culture."" This is a plausible reference to the earliest Indian churches which are known to have used the Syriac New Testament; Syriac being a dialect of the Aramaic language spoken by Jesus and his disciples. Pantaenus' evidence thus indicates that early Christians from the Middle East had already evangelised parts of India by the late 2nd century AD.
Another Christian tradition concerning the birth of Jesus holds that Gaspar, one of the three Biblical Magi, travelled from India to find the infant Jesus along with Melchior of Persia and Balthazar of Arabia.
An early 3rd-century AD Syriac work known as the Acts of Thomas connects the tradition of the Apostle Thomas' Indian ministry with two kings, one in the north and the other in the south. The year of his arrival is widely disputed due to lack of credible records. According to one of the legends in the Acts of Thomas, Thomas was at first reluctant to accept this mission, but Jesus over-ruled him by ordering circumstances so compelling that he was forced to accompany an Indian merchant, Abbanes, to his native place in northwest India, where he found himself in the service of the Indo-Parthian king, Gondophares. The apostle's ministry reputedly resulted in many conversions throughout this northern kingdom, including the king and his brother.
The Acts of Thomas identifies his second mission in India with a kingdom ruled by a certain King named Mahadwa belonging to a 1st-century dynasty in southern India. Niranam Pally also known as St Mary's Orthodox Syrian Church is believed to be one of the oldest churches in India. The church was founded by St Thomas in AD 54. On his way from Kollam (Quilon) in the northeast direction, he arrived at Niranam ""Thrikpapaleswaram"" by sea. The church was reconstructed several times with some parts dating back to a reconstruction in 1259. The architecture of the church bears a striking similarity to Hindu temple architecture.

St Bartholomew
Eusebius of Caesarea's Ecclesiastical History (5:10) states that Bartholomew, a disciple of Jesus, went on a missionary tour to India, where he left behind a copy of the Gospel of Matthew. One tradition holds that he preached the Gospel in India, prior to his travels to Armenia, while others hold that Bartholomew travelled as a missionary in Ethiopia, Mesopotamia, Parthia, and Lycaonia.

Later antiquity
Although little is known of the immediate growth of the church in the northwestern regions of India, Bar-Daisan (154–223 AD) reports that in his time there were Christian tribes in North India that claimed to have been converted by Thomas and had books and relics to prove it. It is believed that by the time of the establishment of the Sassanid Empire around 226 AD, there were bishops of the Church of the East in northwest India, Afghanistan and Baluchistan, with laymen and clergy alike engaging in missionary activity. The Syriac Chronicle of Edessa describes a ""church of the Christians"" in India around 200 AD.
India had a flourishing trade with Central Asia, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East, both along mountain passes in the north and sea routes down the western and southern coast, well before the advent of the Christian era, and it is likely that Christian merchants from these lands settled in Indian cities along these trading routes. The colony of Syrian Christians established at Muziris may be the first Christian community in South India for which there is a continuous written record.
The Chronicle of Seert describes an evangelical mission to India by Bishop David of Basra around the year 300, who reportedly made many conversions, and it has been speculated that his mission took in areas of southern India.
From various records of travelers we know the existence of Christian communities in India already by the year 345.
Thomas of Cana, a Syriac Christian merchant, brought a group of 72 Christian families from Mesopotamia to Kerala in the 4th century. He was granted copper-plates by the Chera Dynasty, which gave his party and all native Christians socio-economic privileges. The group of Christians that came along with Thomas of Cana (Knai Thoma) are called Knanaya Christians.
The existence of Early Christians in India is further substantiated by the records acknowledging the work of Severus of Vienne, a 5th-century missionary of Indian origin who evangelised in Vienne, France.

Medieval period
The Saint Thomas Christian community in Kerala was further strengthened by the arrival of various waves of Syriac Christians from the Middle East. This also resulted in the establishment of Knanaya colonies in Kerala during the 4th century. Babylonian Christians settled on the Malabar coast in the 4th century. Mar Sabor and Mar Proth arrived in Kollam in the 9th century.

Saint Thomas Christians seem to have enjoyed various rights and privileges as well as a high status as recorded on copper plates, also known as Cheppeds, Royal Grants, Sasanam, etc. There are a number of such documents in the possession of the Syrian churches of Kerala which include the Thazhekad Sasanam, the Quilon Plates (or the Tharisappalli Cheppeds), Mampally Sasanam and Iraviikothan Chepped, etc. Some of these plates have been dated to around 774 AD. Scholars have studied the inscriptions and produced varying translations. The language used is Old Malayalam in Vattezhuthu script intermingled with some Grantha, Pahlavi, Kufic and Hebrew scripts. The ruler of Venad (Travancore) granted the Saint Thomas Christians seventy-two rights and privileges which were usually granted only to high dignitaries. These rights included exemption from import duties, sales tax and the slave tax. A copper plate grant dated 1225 AD further enhanced the rights and privileges of Nasranis.
Other references to Saint Thomas Christians include the South Indian epic of Manimekalai, written between 2nd and 3rd century AD, which mentions the Nasrani people by referring to them by the name Essanis. The embassy of King Alfred in 883 AD sent presents to St. Thomas Christians. Marco Polo who visited in 1292, mentioned that there were Christians in the Malabar coast.
The French or Catalan Dominican missionary Jordanus Catalani was the first Catholic European missionary to arrive in India. He landed in Surat in around 1320. By a separate bull, that reads Venerabili Fratri Jordano, he was appointed the first Bishop of Quilon on 21 August 1329 AD. In 1321, Jordanus Catalani also arrived in Bhatkal, a place near Mangalore, and established a missionary station there converting many locals. He also evangelised in Thana district (Trombay) near Bombay; the descendants of these converts would later become part of the Bombay East Indian community.

Modern period
Portuguese efforts to Catholicize Saint Thomas Christians
Thomas the Apostle is credited by tradition for founding the Indian Church in 52 AD. This church developed contacts with the Church of the East religious authorities based in Edessa, Mesopotamia at the time.
Historically, this community was organised as the Province of India of the Church of the East by Patriarch of Babylon Timothy I (780–823 AD) in the eighth century, served by bishops and a local dynastic archdeacon. In the 14th century, the Church of the East declined due to persecution from Tamerlane. The 16th century witnessed the colonial overtures of the Portuguese Padroado aiming to bring St Thomas Christians into the Latin Catholic Church, administered by the Portuguese Padroado Archdiocese of Goa, leading to the first of several rifts in the community. The efforts of the Portuguese culminated in the Synod of Diamper, formally subjugating them and their whole Archdiocese of Angamaly as a suffragan see to the Archdiocese of Goa administered by Roman Catholic Padroado missionaries.
The death of the last metropolitan bishop – Archbishop Abraham of the Saint Thomas Christians, an ancient body formerly part of the Church of the East in 1597 gave the then Archbishop of Goa Menezes an opportunity to bring the native church under the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. He was able to secure the submission of Archdeacon George, the highest remaining representative of the native church hierarchy. Menezes convened the Synod of Diamper between 20 and 26 June 1599, which introduced a number of reforms to the church and brought it fully into the Latin Church of the Catholic Church. Following the Synod, Menezes consecrated Francis Ros, S. J. as Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Angamalé for the Saint Thomas Christians; thus created another suffragan see to Archdiocese of Goa and Latinisation of St Thomas Christians started. The Saint Thomas Christians were pressured to acknowledge the authority of the Pope and most of them eventually accepted the Catholic faith, but a part of them switched to West Syriac Rite. Resentment of these measures led to some part of the community to join the Archdeacon, Thomas, in swearing never to submit to the Portuguese Jesuits in the Coonan Cross Oath in 1653. Those who accepted the West Syriac theological and liturgical tradition of Gregorios became known as Jacobites. The others who continued with East Syriac theological and liturgical tradition stayed faithful to the Catholic Church and later became autonomous eastern catholic church named Syro Malabar Church (suriyani malabar sabha).
Following the synod, the Indian Church was governed by Portuguese prelates. They were generally unwilling to respect the integrity of the local church. This resulted in disaffection which led to a general revolt in 1653 known as the ""Coonan Cross Oath"". Under the leadership of Archdeacon Thomas, Nazranis around Cochin gathered at Mattancherry church on Friday, 24 January 1653 (M.E. 828 Makaram 3) and made an oath that is known as the Great Oath of Bent Cross. There are various versions about the wording of oath, one version being that the oath was directed against the Portuguese, another that it was directed against Jesuits, yet another version that it was directed against the authority of Church of Rome. Those who were not able to touch the cross tied ropes on the cross, held the rope in their hands and made the oath. Because of the weight it is believed by the followers that the cross bent a little and so it is known as ""Oath of the bent cross"" (Coonen Kurisu Sathyam). This demanded administrative autonomy for the local church.
A few months, later Archdeacon Thomas was ordained as bishop by twelve priests with the title Thoma I. At this time, Rome intervened and Carmelite Missionaries were sent to win the Thomas Christians back. Carmelites could convince the majority that the local church needs bishops and the consecration of the Archdeacon Thomas was invalid because the consecration was conducted not by a bishop, but by priests. Many leaders of the community rejoined the missionaries. But in 1663, Dutch conquered Cochin supplanting the Portuguese on the Malabar coast. Portuguese Missionaries had to leave the country and they consecrated Palliveettil Chandy kathanaar as the bishop for the Catholic Thomas Christians on 1 February 1663. Meanwhile, Thoma I appealed to several eastern Christian churches for regularizing his consecration. The Syriac Orthodox Patriarch responded and sent metropolitan Gregorios Abdul Jaleel of Jerusalem to India in 1665. He confirmed Thoma I as a bishop and worked together with him to organize the Church. These events led to the gradual and lasting schism among the Saint Thomas Christians of India, leading to the formation of Puthenkūr (New allegiance) and Pazhayakūr (Old allegiance) factions.

The Pazhayakūr comprise the present day Syro-Malabar Catholic Church and Chaldean Syrian Church which continue to employ the East Syriac Rite. The Puthenkūr, who entered into a new communion with the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch, an Oriental Orthodox church, inherited from them the West Syriac Rite, replacing the old East Syriac Rite liturgy. Puthenkūr is the body from which present day Jacobite Syrian Christian Church, Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, CSI Syrian Christians, Mar Thoma Syrian Church, St. Thomas Evangelical Church of India, Syro-Malankara Catholic Church and Malabar Independent Syrian Church originate.

Arrival of Europeans
In 1453, the fall of Constantinople to the Sunni Islamic Ottoman Caliphate marked the end of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman Empire), and severed European trade links by land with Asia. This massive blow to Christendom spurred the Age of Discovery as Europeans started seeking alternative routes east by sea along with the goal of forging alliances with pre-existing Christian nations. Along with Portuguese long-distance maritime travelers that reached the Malabar Coast in the late 15th century, came Portuguese missionaries who made contact with the St Thomas Christians in Kerala. These Christians were following Eastern Christian practices and under the jurisdiction of Church of the East. The missionaries sought to introduce the Latin liturgical rites among them and unify East Syriac Christians in India under the Holy See. This group, which existed in Kerala relatively peacefully for more than a millennium, faced considerable persecution from Portuguese evangelists in the 16th century. This later wave of evangelism spread Catholicism more widely along the Konkan coast.
The South Indian coastal areas around Kanyakumari were known for pearl fisheries ruled by the Paravars. From 1527, the Paravars, being threatened by Arab fleets offshore who were supported Zamorin of Calicut, sought the protection of the Portuguese who had moved into the area. The protection was granted on the condition that the leaders were immediately baptised as Christians and that they would encourage their people also to convert to Christianity. The Portuguese in turn wanted to gain a strategic foothold and control of the pearl fisheries. The deal was agreed and some months later 20,000 Paravars were baptised en masse, and by 1537 the entire community had declared itself to be Christian. The Portuguese navy destroyed the Arab fleet at Vedalai on 27 June 1538.
Francis Xavier, a Jesuit, began a mission to the lower classes of Tamil society in 1542. A further 30,000 Paravars were baptised. Xavier appointed catechists in the Paravar villages up and down the 100 miles (160 km) coastline to spread and reinforce his teachings. Paravar Christianity, with its own identity based on a mixture of Christian religious belief and Hindu caste culture, remains a defining part of the Paravar life today.

In the 16th century, the proselytisation of Asia was linked to the Portuguese colonial policy. Missionaries of the different orders including Franciscans, Dominicans, Jesuits, Augustinians arrived with the Portuguese colonisers. The history of Portuguese missionaries in India starts with the Portuguese clergy who reached Kappad near Kozhikode on 20 May 1498, along with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama who was seeking to form anti-Islamic alliances with pre-existing Christian nations. The lucrative spice trade was further temptation for the Portuguese crown. When he and the Portuguese missionaries arrived, they found Christians in the country in Malabar known as St. Thomas Christians who belonged to the then-largest Christian church within India. The Christians were friendly to Portuguese missionaries at first; there was an exchange of gifts between them, and these groups were delighted at their common faith.

During the second expedition, the Portuguese fleet comprising 13 ships and 18 priests, under Captain Pedro Álvares Cabral, anchored at Cochin on 26 November 1500. Cabral soon won the goodwill of the Raja of Cochin. He allowed four priests to do apostolic work among the early Christian communities scattered in and around Cochin. Thus Portuguese missionaries established Portuguese Mission in 1500. Dom Francisco de Almeida, the first Portuguese Viceroy got permission from the Kochi Raja to build two churches – namely Santa Cruz Basilica (1505) and St. Francis Church (1506) using stones and mortar, which was unheard of at that time, as the local prejudices were against such a structure for any purpose other than a royal palace or a temple.
In the beginning of the 16th century, the whole of the east was under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Lisbon. On 12 June 1514, Cochin and Goa became two prominent mission stations under the newly created Diocese of Funchal in Madeira. In 1534, Pope Paul III by the Bull Quequem Reputamus, raised Funchal as an archdiocese and Goa as its suffragan, deputing the whole of India under the diocese of Goa. This created an episcopal see – suffragan to Funchal, with a jurisdiction extending potentially over all past and future conquests from the Cape of Good Hope to China.
The first converts to Christianity in Goa were native Goan women who married Portuguese men that arrived with Afonso de Albuquerque during the Portuguese conquest of Goa in 1510. Due to the Christianisation of Goa, over 90% of the Goans in the Velhas Conquistas became Catholic by the 1700s.

The Portuguese government supported the missionaries. At the same time many New Christians from Portugal emigrated to India as a result of the Portuguese Inquisition. Many of them were suspected of being Crypto-Jews and Crypto-Muslims, converted Jews and Muslims who were secretly practising their old religions. Both were considered a threat to the solidarity of Christian belief. According to Maria Aurora Couto, Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier requested the installation of the Goa Inquisition in a letter dated 16 May 1546 to King John III of Portugal, but the tribunal commenced only in 1560. The Inquisition office persecuted Hindus, Muslims, Bene Israels, New Christians and the Judaizing Nasranis. Crypto-Hindus were the primary target of the 250 years of persecution and punishment for their faith by the Catholic prosecutors. Most affected were the Shudras (12.5%) and farmers (35.5%).
In 1557, Goa was made an independent archbishopric, and its first suffragan sees were erected at Cochin and Malacca. The whole of the East came under the jurisdiction of Goa and its boundaries extended to almost half of the world: from the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, to Burma, China and Japan in East Asia. In 1576, the suffragan See of Macao (China) was added; and in 1588, that of Funai in Japan.
The Diocese of Angamaly was transferred to Diocese of Craganore in 1605, while, in 1606 a sixth suffragan see to Goa was established at San Thome, Mylapore, near the modern Madras, and the site of the National Shrine of St. Thomas Basilica. The suffragan sees added later to Goa. were the prelacy of Mozambique (1612), Peking (1609) and Nanking (1609) in China.
A significant portion of the crew on Portuguese ships were Indian Christians.
The Portuguese were however unable to establish their presence in Mangalore as a result of the conquests of the Vijayanagara ruler Krishnadevaraya and Abbakka Rani of Ullal, the Bednore Queen of Mangalore. Most of Mangalorean Catholics were not originally from Mangalore but from Goa, which they fled during the Sackings of Goa and Bombay-Bassein and to escape the persecution of the Goan Inquisition.
The Franciscans spearheaded the evangelisation of the ""Province of the North"" (Província do Norte) headquartered at Fort San Sebastian of Bassein (close to present day Mumbai), but the fort's officials were subordinate to the viceroy in the capital of Velha Goa. From 1534 to 1552, a priest by the name António do Porto converted over 10,000 people, built a dozen churches, convents, and a number of orphanages hospitals and seminaries. Prominent among the converts were two yogis from the Kanheri Caves who became known as Paulo Raposo and Francisco de Santa Maria. They introduced Christianity to their fellow yogis, converting many in the process. The descendants of these Christians are today known as the Bombay East Indian Christians who are predominantly Roman Catholics and inhabitants of the north Konkan region.
In Portuguese Bombay and Bassein missionary work progressed on a large scale and with great success along the western coasts, chiefly at Chaul, Bombay, Salsette, Bassein, Damao, and Diu; and on the eastern coasts at San Thome of Mylapore, and as far as Bengal etc. In the southern districts the Jesuit mission in Madura was the most famous. It extended to the Krishna river, with a number of outlying stations beyond it. The mission of Cochin, on the Malabar Coast, was also one of the most fruitful. Several missions were also established in the interior northwards that of Agra and Lahore in 1570 and that of Tibet in 1624. Still, even with these efforts, and many vast tracts of the interior northwards were practically unreached.
With the decline of the Portuguese power, other colonial powers namely the Dutch and British gained influence, paving the way for the arrival of Protestantism.

Arrival of Protestant missions
Beginning in about 1700, Protestant missionaries began working throughout India; this led to the establishment of different Christian communities across the Indian Subcontinent.

German Lutherans and Basel mission
The first Protestant missionaries to set foot in India were two Lutherans from Germany, Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg and Heinrich Plütschau, who began work in 1705 in the Danish settlement of Tranquebar. They translated the Bible into the local Tamil language, and afterwards into Hindustani. They made little progress at first, but gradually the mission spread to Madras, Cuddalore and Tanjore. The Bishop of Tranquebar is still the official title of the bishop of the Tamil Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tamil Nadu which was founded in 1919 as a result of the German Lutheran Leipzig Mission and Church of Sweden Mission, the successors of Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg and Heinrich Plütschau. The seat of the bishop, the cathedral and its church house, the Tranquebar House are in Tiruchirappalli.
German missionary Johann Phillip Fabricius, who arrived in South India in 1740, published the first Tamil to English dictionary and refined the Tamil Bible translation.
Christian Friedrich Schwarz was a prominent German Lutheran missionary who arrived in India in 1750. His mission was instrumental in the conversion of many people from Tamil Nadu to Lutheranism. He died in Tamil Nadu and was buried in St.Peter's Church at Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu.
Hermann Gundert a German missionary, scholar, and linguist, as well as the maternal grandfather of German novelist and Nobel laureate Hermann Hesse was a missionary in the South Indian state of Kerala and was instrumental in compiling a Malayalam grammar book, Malayalabhaasha Vyakaranam (1859), in which he developed and constructed the grammar currently spoken by the Malayalis, published a Malayalam-English dictionary (1872), and contributed to work on Bible translations into Malayalam.
Eugen Liebendörfer was the first German missionary doctor in India as part of the Basel Mission. He built hospitals in Kerala and Karnataka.
Another Basel Missionary Ferdinand Kittel worked in South Indian state of Karnataka in places such as Mangalore, Madikeri and Dharwad in Karnataka. He is renowned for his studies of the Kannada language and for producing a Kannada-English dictionary of about 70,000 words in 1894. He also composed numerous Kannada poems.
Hermann Mögling was a German missionary to Karnataka, he is credited as the publisher of the first ever newspaper in the Kannada language called as Mangalooru Samachara in 1843. He was awarded a doctorate for his literary work in Kannada called as Bibliotheca Carnataca. He also translated Kannada literature into German.
Another Lutheran German missionary to South Indian state of Kerala was Volbrecht Nagel, he was a missionary to the Malabar coast of India. Initially associated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church, he later joined the Open Brethren, and is remembered now as a pioneer of the Kerala Brethren movement.

William Carey and the Baptists
In 1793, William Carey, an English Baptist Minister, came to India as a missionary but also as a man of learning in economics, medicine and botany. He worked in Serampore, Calcutta, and other places. He translated the Bible into Bengali, Sanskrit, and numerous other languages and dialects. He worked in India despite the hostility of the British East India Company until his death in 1834. Carey and his colleagues, Joshua Marshman and William Ward, blended science, Christianity, and constructive Orientalism in their work at the Danish settlement of Serampore, near Calcutta. Carey saw the dissemination of European science and Christianity as mutually supportive and equally important civilizing missions. He also supported a revival of Sanskrit science. Carey played a key role in the establishment of the Agricultural Society of India. Ward, beginning in 1806, published important commentaries on ancient Hindu medical and astronomy texts. In 1818, Carey and his fellow missionaries founded Serampore College to nurture a uniquely Indian variety of European science.

Other missions
The London Missionary Society was the first Protestant mission in Andhra Pradesh which established its station at Visakhapatnam in 1805. Anthony Norris Groves, a Plymouth Brethren missionary arrived in 1833. He worked in the Godavari delta area until his death in 1852. John Christian Frederick Heyer was the first Lutheran missionary in the region of Andhra Pradesh. He founded the Guntur Mission in 1842. Supported initially by the Pennsylvania Ministerium, and later by the Foreign Mission Board of the General Synod, Heyer was also encouraged and assisted by British government officials. He established a number of hospitals and a network of schools throughout the Guntur region.
The Church Missionary Society (CMS), a mission society working with the Anglican Communion, began sending missionaries to India and established mission stations at Chennai (Madras) and Bengal, then in 1816 at Travancore. The CMS Mission to India expanded in the following years. The successors of the Protestant church missions are the Church of South India and the Church of North India.
Marathi Christians can be found in the areas of Ahmednagar, Solapur, Poona, and Aurangabad. They were converted through the efforts of the American Marathi Mission, The SPG Mission, and the Church Mission Society of Church of England in the early 18th century. British missionary William Carey was instrumental in translating the Bible into the Marathi language.
During the Bettiah Raj of Bihar, the ethnoreligious community of Bettiah Christians was established in India in the 17th century by Christian missionaries belonging to the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, a Roman Catholic religious order. The Capuchins were personally invited to establish the Bettiah Christian Mission by Maharaja Dhurup Singh after the Italian Capuchin priest Joseph Mary Bernini treated his ill wife. Pope Benedict XIV, on 1 May 1742, approved the appointment of the Capuchins at the Bettiah Fort in a letter to Maharaja Dhurup Singh.
Many upper-class Bengalis converted to Christianity during the Bengali Renaissance under British Rule, including Krishna Mohan Banerjee, Michael Madhusudan Dutt, Anil Kumar Gain, and Gnanendramohan Tagore, Aurobindo Nath Mukherjee.
During the 19th century, several American Baptist missionaries evangelised in the northeastern parts of India. In 1876, Dr. E. W. Clark first went to live in a Naga village, four years after his Assamese helper, Godhula, baptised the first Naga converts. Rev. and Mrs. A.F. Merrill arrived in India in 1928 and worked in the southeast section of the Garo Hills. Rev. and Mrs. M.J. Chance spent most of the years between 1950 and 1956 at Golaghat working with the Naga and Garo tribes. Even today, the heaviest concentrations of Christians in India continue to be in the Northeast among the Nagas, Khasis, Kukis, and Mizos.

Role in the Indian independence movement
Indian Christians were involved even at early stages of the nationalist movement in colonial India, both in the Indian National Congress and the wider Indian independence movement:
Indian Christian involvement in the early stages of the nationalist movement is also reflected in the high levels of participation in the activities of the Indian National Congress. During the period from its inception up until about 1892 all the evidence suggests that Indian Christians enthusiastically supported the National Congress and attended its annual meetings. For example, according to the official Congress report, there were 607 registered delegates at the Madras meeting of 1887; thirty-five were Christians and, of these, seven were Eurasians and fifteen were Indian Christians. Indian Christians alone made up 2.5 per cent of the total attendance, in spite of the fact that Christians accounted for less than 0.79 per cent of the population. The Indian Christian community was also well represented at the next four sessions of the Congress. The proportion of Indian Christian delegates remained very much higher than their proportion in the population, in spite of the fact that meetings were sometimes held in cities such as Allahabad and Nagpur, far removed from the main centres of Christian population.
The All India Conference of Indian Christians (AICIC) played an important role in the Indian independence movement, advocating for swaraj and opposing the partition of India. The AICIC also was opposed to separate electorates for Christians, believing that the faithful ""should participate as common citizens in one common, national political system"". The All India Conference of Indian Christians and the All India Catholic Union formed a working committee with M. Rahnasamy of Andhra University serving as president and B.L. Rallia Ram of Lahore serving as general secretary; in its meeting on 16 April 1947 and 17 April 1947, the joint committee prepared a 13-point memorandum that was sent to the Constituent Assembly of India, which asked for religious freedom for both organisations and individuals; this came to be reflected in the Constitution of India.

Art and architecture
There are a large number of items of artistic and architectural significance in the religious and domestic life of Indian Christians. Altars, statues, pulpits, crosses, bells and belfries of churches along with other household items are among the many things that form part of the sacred art of the Indian Christians.
The following artistic elements predate European Christianity and form an integral part of the religious art and architecture of the Saint Thomas Christians:

The open-air granite (rock) cross called the Nasrani Sthamba
Kodimaram (Dwajasthamba) or flag-staff made of Kerala's famed teak wood and often enclosed in copper hoses or paras
The rock Deepasthamba or lampstand.
After the arrival of Vasco da Gama and more especially after the commencement of Portuguese rule in India, distinct patterns of Christian art developed within the areas of Portuguese influence, mostly along the coasts of the peninsula. The Portuguese commissioned monumental buildings and promoted architecture more than any other form of fine art. St. Francis Church, Kochi is the first European place of worship in India and incidentally also the place where Vasco da Gama was first buried. The Christian art of Goa reached its climax in church building, laying the foundations of Indian Baroque.
Indian Christian architecture during the British Raj has expanded into several different styles as a result of extensive church building in different parts of the country. The style that was most patronised is generally referred to as the British Regency style followed by Neo-Gothic and Gothic Revival architecture. Most Protestant cathedrals and churches in India conform to the Neo-Gothic and Gothic Revival architecture styles. The adaptation of European architectural elements to the tropical climate in India has resulted in the creation of the Indo-Gothic style. St. Paul's Cathedral, Kolkata is a typical example of this style. St. Mary's church, Chennai, the first Anglican Church built east of the Suez is one of the first examples of British colonial architecture in India. French and Danish influences on Christian art and architecture in India can be seen in their respective colonies.

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		

Kerala Christians have a unique tradition of photographing funerals.

Culture
While Christians in India do not share one common culture, their cultures for the most part tend to be a blend of Indian, Syrian and European cultures. It differs from one region to another depending on several factors such as the prevailing liturgical rite and tradition and the extent of time for which Christianity has existed in those regions. The ancient Saint Thomas Christians of Kerala have a distinctively different culture when compared to Christians in other parts of the country. Historical ties with the Church of the East and assimilation of Indian culture have contributed to the development of a unique subculture among these traditional Syrian Christians or Nasranis of Kerala. The use of ornamental umbrellas for Christian religious festivities illustrates an example of the indigenous character of Kerala's Syriac Christianity. The Malankara Nasranis (Thomasine Christians) have a unique Syro-Malabarese culture which includes Christianised Jewish elements, along with some Hindu customs.
As a result of the Christianisation of Goa by the Portuguese in the 16th century AD, Goan Catholics have adopted a more Western culture. The dance, song and cuisine of Goa has been greatly influenced by the Portuguese. The culture of Goan Catholics is a mix of Portuguese and Konkani cultures, with the former having a more dominant role because the Portuguese ruled Goa directly from 1510 to 1961. Mangalorean Catholics, who are mainly migrants from the Konkan region to the Canara subregion of Carnataca, have developed a distinct Mangalorean Catholic culture. Christianity in other parts of India spread under the colonial regimes of the Dutch, Danish, French and most importantly the English from the early 17th century to the time of the Indian Independence in 1947. Christian culture in various parts of India, has been influenced by the religion and culture of their respective colonisers.
Contemporary Christian culture in India draws greatly from the English culture, as a result of the influence and dominance of former British Indian rule, this is evident in the culture of Bombay East Indian Christians, who were the first subjects of English rule, in the erstwhile Seven Islands of Bombay and the adjacent areas of North Konkan. The Book of Common Prayer is a widely used supplement for worship in the two major Anglican Protestant denominations: Church of South India and Church of North India. Today Christians are considered to be one of the most progressive communities in India. Urban Christians are to a greater extent influenced by European culture, which is considered an advantage in the business environment of urban India; this is given as an explanation for the large number of Christian professionals in India's corporate sector. The Christian church runs thousands of educational institutions which have contributed to the strengthening of Christian culture in India.
Religion plays a significant role in the daily life of Indian Christians, India ranks 15 among countries with based on church attendance. Religious processions and carnivals are often celebrated by Indian Catholics. Cities with significant Christian populations celebrate patron saint days. As in other parts of the world, Christmas is the most important festival for Indian Christians. Anglo-Indian Christmas balls held in most major cities form a distinctive part of Indian Christian culture. Great Friday is a national holiday, All Souls Day is another holiday that is observed by most Christians in India. Most Protestant churches celebrate harvest festivals, usually in late October or early November. Easter and All Saints Day are also observed by many.
Christian weddings in India conform to the white wedding. However, some Christian brides in the south, wear a white sari instead of a white dress (gown). Prior to the 1960s, the dhothi was worn by South Canarese Christian bridegrooms to their Church weddings; it has almost completely been replaced by the black suit and tie nowadays.

Demographics
The 2001 census of India recorded 24,080,016 Christians in the country, representing 2.34 per cent of the population. A majority of Indian Christians are Protestants, followed by Catholics and Oriental Orthodox etc.

Population by denomination
In 2011, Pew reported 18,860,000 Protestants, 10,570,000 Catholics, 2,370,000 Oriental Orthodox and 50,000 other Christians in India. Other sources estimate the total number of Protestants throughout the country in several hundreds of denominations at 45 million (45 million). Several sources estimate Catholic population in India at over 17 million (1.7 crore) The largest single denomination is the Catholic Church. Anglicans within the united Church of North India and Church of South India, constitute the second largest group at over 5 million (5 million).

Catholic denominations
The Saint Thomas Christians (Syro Malabar Church, Syro-Malankara Catholic Church, Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, Jacobite Syrian Christian Church, Chaldean Syrian Church, CSI Syrian Christians, Mar Thoma Syrian Church, Pentecostal Syrian Christians, St. Thomas Evangelical Church and Malabar Independent Syrian Church) of Kerala form 18.75% of the Christians in India with 4.5 million of them. 310,000 were members of the Syro-Malankara Church and 4,000,000 of the Syro-Malabar Church. In January 1993, the Syro-Malabar Church and in February 2005, the Syro-Malankara Church were raised to the status of major archiepiscopal churches by Pope John Paul II. The Syro-Malabar Church is the second largest among the 23 Eastern Catholic Churches who accept the Pope as the visible head of the whole church. The Oriental Orthodox churches in India include the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church with 1120,000 members, the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church with 800,000 members and the Malabar Independent Syrian Church with 30,000 members. The Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church is an Eastern Protestant denomination with 1,100,000 members.

Protestant denominations
Most Protestant denominations are represented in India, as a result of missionary activities throughout the country, such as the American Missionary Association, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel Mission, the Church Mission Society of the Church of England and many other missions from Europe, America and Australia. In 1961, an evangelical wing of the Mar Thoma Church split and formed the St. Thomas Evangelical Church of India which has 35,000 members. There are about 1,267,786 Lutherans, 648,000 Methodists, 2,392,694 Baptists, and 823,456 Presbyterians in India.
The Open Brethren movement is also significantly represented in India. The main Brethren grouping is known as the Indian Brethren (with a following estimated at somewhere between 449,550 and 1,000,000), of which the Kerala Brethren are a significant subset. The closely related Assemblies Jehovah Shammah have around 310,000 adults and children in fellowship as of 2010. They are often considered part of the wider Brethren movement, although they were founded by an indigenous evangelist (Bakht Singh) and developed independently of the older Indian Brethren movement, which originated from missionary endeavours.
Pentecostalism is also a rapidly growing movement in India. The major Pentecostal churches in India are the Indian Pentecostal Church of God, the Assemblies of God, The Pentecostal Mission, the New Apostolic Church with 1,448,209 members, the New Life Fellowship Association with 480,000 members, the Manna Full Gospel Churches with 275,000 members, and the Evangelical Church of India with 250,000 members.

Population by region and group
Christianity is the predominant religion in the northeastern states of Nagaland, Mizoram Meghalaya, and Manipur. There are substantial Christian populations, in the regions of Arunachal, Assam, Tripura, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Goa and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The Christian population of Bombay (Mumbai) area, is above the national average of 2.3 percent and found to be at 3.45 percent according to the 2011 census. 
A 2015 study estimates some 40,000 Christian believers from a Muslim background in the country, most of them belonging to Protestantism.
The census of India provides us with the official numbers for Christian population in India. The Indian census has been recorded every ten years since 1871 and has always included religion (along with population, race, rural distribution, and occupation, among others). The most recently published census is from 2011. Subsequent estimates from 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019 are also considered reliable.

The native majority of Goa is Christian. According to the 1909 statistics in the Catholic Encyclopedia, the total Christian population in Portuguese controlled Goa was 293,628 out of a total population of 365,291 (80.33%). Due to emigration of natives (mostly Goan Catholics) from Goa to cosmopolitan cities in India (Mumbai, Bangalore, etc.) and to foreign countries, as well as mass migration of non-Christians to Goa from other states of India since the 20th century, the demographics of Goa have been severely altered. Less than 50% of Indian residents in Goa are ethnic Goans.

Conflicts and controversies
Hindu-Christian conflict and controversy
The arrival of European colonialists brought about large-scale missionary activity in coastal India and North-East India. The Cuncolim Massacre and the Mahratta invasions of Goa-Anjediva and Bombay-Bassein are among the first known clashes. Christianity has been propagandised as a ""foreign"" religion, with the growth of Hindu fundamentalism, despite the fact that several Christian individuals and institutions have been for Indian nationalism.
During the 1998 attacks on Christians in southeastern Gujarat, the Human Rights Watch reported that from 25 December 1988 to 3 January 1999, at least 20 prayer halls were damaged or burnt down and Christian institutions were attacked in the Dangs district, and its surrounding districts and at least 25 villages had reported incidents of burning and damages to prayer halls all over Gujarat.
On 22 January 1999, an Australian missionary Graham Staines and his two sons were burnt to death by Dara Singh (Bajrang Dal) while sleeping in his station wagon at Manoharpur village in Keonjhar district in Odisha, India. In the annual human rights reports for 1999, the United States Department of State also criticized India for ""increasing societal violence against Christians."" The report on anti-Christian violence listed over 90 incidents of anti-Christian violence, ranging from damage of religious property to violence against Christians pilgrims. The states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu passed laws placing restrictions on forced religious conversions as a result of communal tension between Christians and Hindus. The legislation passed in Tamil Nadu was later repealed.
In 2007, 19 churches were burned by Hindu right-wingers in Odisha following conflicts between Hindus and Christians regarding Christmas celebrations in the Kandhamal district.
In 2008, there was again violence against Christians, particularly in the state of Odisha, after the murder of Swami Lakshmanananda by Indian Maoists (communist insurgents), tensions flared between the two communities in 2008. Christians were blamed and attacked in Orissa with 38 killed and over 250 churches damaged while several thousands of Christians were displaced. Sitting Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Manoj Pradhan was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for six years by a fast track court for a murder during the 2008 communal riots in Odisha's Kandhamal district. The 2008 anti-Christian attacks in Orissa spilled over and escalated into the 2008 attacks on Christians in southern Karnataka state. The acts of violence include arson and vandalism of churches, forced conversion of Christians to Hinduism by threats of physical violence, distribution of threatening literature, burning of Bibles, raping of nuns, murder of Christian priests, and destruction of Christian schools, colleges and cemeteries.
A program or movement with its roots in Hindutva ideology, known as Ghar wapasi ('returning home'), sponsored by a number of Hindu nationalist groups, facilitates the mass conversion of Christians– and, especially, Muslims –""back"" to their supposedly ""inherent"" or ""natural"" religion of Hinduism. Organisations which promote Ghar wapasi include the far-right Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the  Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Dharm Jagaran Samiti. Its support by influential officials within the  BJP, the governing party, has led to criticism such that support threatens the secularism and freedom of religion enshrined in India's constitution.
India is number 10 on Open Doors' 2022 World Watch List, an annual ranking of the fifty countries where Christians face the most extreme persecution. However, a faction of the Syrian Christians of Kerala do support the Hindutva ideology and extremist groups like the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS); which was involved in the violent and forceful demolition of the Babri Masjid. While some have argued that Hindu caste based discrimination has continued among Christians in India, other Indians and Hindus have denied caste based reservation to Dalit Christians.

Muslim–Christian conflict and controversy
The relationship between Muslims and Christians in India has also been occasionally turbulent. With the advent of European colonialism in India throughout the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, Christians were systematically persecuted in certain Muslim-ruled kingdoms in India, particularly the actions by Tippu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore against the Mangalorean Catholics (South Canara). The captivity of Mangalorean Catholics at Seringapatam, which began on 24 February 1784 and ended 15 years later on 4 May 1799, remains the most disconsolate memory in that community's history.
The Bakur Manuscript reports Tippu Sultan as having said:

All Musalmans should unite together, considering the annihilation of infidels as a sacred duty, and labour to the utmost of their power, to accomplish that subject.
Soon after the Treaty of Mangalore in 1784, Tipu gained control of South Canara. He issued orders to seize the Christians in Canara, confiscate their estates, and deport them to Seringapatam, the capital of his empire, via the Jamalabad-fort route. However, there were no priests among the captives. Together with Fr Miranda, all the 21 arrested priests were issued orders of expulsion to Goa, fined Rs 200,000, and threatened with death by hanging if they ever returned.
Tipu ordered the destruction of twenty-seven Catholic churches all intricately carved with statues depicting various saints. Among them were Nossa Senhora de Rosario Milagres at Mangalore, Jesu Marie Jose at Omzoor, the Chapel at Bolar, the Church of Merces at Ullal, Imaculata Conceiciao at Mulki, Sao Lawrence at Karkal and Immaculata Conceciao at Baidnur. All were razed to the ground, with the exception of the Church of Holy Cross at Hospet, owing to the friendly offices of the Chauta Raja of Moodbidri.
An instigating factor that helped spark the Indian Rebellion of 1857 was, for Muslims sepoys, resistance to the East India Company's introduction of the new Enfield Rifle-Musket—abhorrent to them due to a belief that the weapon's cartridges, which they would be required to handle and even to bite open the encasing papers, were greased with pig fat, a religiously unacceptable agent for Muslim soldiers. Sepoys interpreted the rumours of grease constituents as a deliberate ploy by the company to defile Muslim soldiers so that they would convert to Christianity. In combination with a corresponding idea that cow fat was included to defile Hindu soldiers, this was perceived as an attempt to impose Christian law in Hindustan.
Historian William Dalrymple notes the religiously imbued rhetoric employed, in contrast to nationalistic sentiment. For instance, when Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar met the sepoys on 11 May 1857, he was told: ""We have joined hands to protect our religion and our faith."" They later stood in Chandni Chowk, the main square, and asked the people gathered there, ""Brothers, are you with those of the faith?"" Those British men and women who had previously converted to Islam such as the defectors, Sergeant-Major Gordon, and Abdullah Beg, a former Company soldier, were spared. In contrast, foreign Christians such as the Rev Midgeley John Jennings, as well as Indian converts to Christianity such as one of Zafar's personal physicians, Chaman Lal, were killed outright. Dalrymple recounts that as late as 6 September, when calling the inhabitants of Delhi to rally against the upcoming British assault, Zafar issued a proclamation stating that this was a religious war being prosecuted on behalf of ""the faith"", and that all Muslim and Hindu residents of the imperial city, or of the countryside were encouraged to stay true to their faith and creeds. He observes that the Urdu sources of the pre- and post-rebellion periods usually refer to the British not as angrez ('the English'), goras ('whites') or firangis ('foreigners'), but as kafir ('infidels') and nasrani ('Christians').
Muslims in India who convert to Christianity are considered apostates and subject to harassment, intimidation, and attacks by Muslims. In Jammu and Kashmir, a Christian convert and missionary named Bashir Tantray was killed, allegedly by militant Islamists in 2006.

India is home to the majority of the global Sikh population.

History
Partition
Sikh organizations, including the Chief Khalsa Dewan and Shiromani Akali Dal led by Master Tara Singh, strongly opposed the partition of India, viewing the possibility of the creation of Pakistan as inviting persecution.

Demography
Population
India's Sikh population stands at 20.8 million, which is only 1.72% of the country's total population. Out of approximately 25–30 million Sikhs in the world, the majority of them, 20.8–22 million, live in India that is about (83.2%–84.1%) of the world's Sikh population. Sikhs have a fertility rate of 1.6 in India, which is the lowest in the nation as per as according to year 2019–21 estimation.
Out of the total Sikhs in India, 77% are concentrated in state of Punjab. Sikhism is the dominant religion in Punjab, India, where it is followed by 16 million constituting 57.7% of the population, the only Indian state where Sikhism is the majority faith. By 2050, according to Pew research center based on growth rate of current Sikh population between (2001–2011), India will have 30,012,386 Sikhs by half-century which will be more than that of any country including the west.

Concerns
On May 09, 2024, The Damdami Taksal, a Khalsa Sikh cultural and educational organisation, has urged Sikh and Punjabi families to have at least five children to strengthen their religious, social, political, and cultural presence in India as well as in their stronghold Punjab. The organisation's current head, Baba Harnam Singh Khalsa, stated that larger families would help build stronger familial bonds and contribute to societal development. Concerns over declining fertility rates among Sikhs and Punjabis have been raised in recent years. According to census data and demographic studies, the Sikh population in India has not seen significant growth compared to other communities. The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) among Sikhs has been below replacement level in several regions, which has led to concerns about demographic shifts over time. In response, Damdami Taksal has also announced support for families facing economic difficulties in raising multiple children. Meanwhile, data from a study published by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) indicates that from 1950 to 2015, the Hindu population in India declined from 84.68% to 78.06%, while the Muslim population increased from 9.84% to 14.09%. The Sikh population, which stood at 1.24% in 1950, saw a modest increase to 1.85% in 2015. These demographic trends have led to discussions within Sikh and Punjabi communities about the need for maintaining their population growth. The appeal for larger families aligns with broader concerns about declining birth rates and demographic changes in Punjab, where migration and economic challenges have also played a role in shaping population trends.

National and ethnic origins
Although Punjabi Sikhs form the majority of the Sikh population, the Sikh community is varied and includes people who speak the Pashto language, the Brahui language, the Telugu language, Marathi language, Assamese language, Hindi language, Sindhi language, Bengali language and many more. The many communities following Sikhism is detailed below.

Afghan Sikhs
The Sikhs of Afghanistan are primarily Punjabi merchants and immigrants. They speak the Punjabi language within themselves but are usually fluent in Dari and occasionally Pashto as well.

Bengali Sikhs
Sikhism in the Bengal region dates back to 1504 but has declined after the partition. Sikhism first emerged in Bengal when Guru Nanak visited Bengal in 1504 and established a number of Gurdwaras.
By the early 18th century, there were a few Sikhs living in the region of Bengal. One famous Sikh who lived during this time period was Omichand, a local Khatri Sikh banker and landlord who participate in the conspiracy against Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah with the East India Company. The Flemish artist Frans Baltazard Solvyns arrived in Calcutta in 1791 and observed many Sikhs, whom one could differentiate from the rest of the land's inhabitants by their garbs and traditions. He etched depictions of a Khalsa Sikh and a Nanakpanthi, which was published in 1799.
Gurdwara Nanak Shahi is the principal Sikh Gurdwara (prayer hall) in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It is located at the campus of the University of Dhaka and considered to be the biggest of the 7 Gurdwaras in the country. After the Partition of India, the Sikh community left for India.
After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 and Bangladesh Liberation War, Indian Sikh soldiers helped renovate the Gurdwaras left in Bangladesh. Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur ji visited Dhaka. There is another Sikh temple known as the Gurudwara Sangat Tola. Many Sikhs also used to visit a well at the ruins of Jafarabad which they believed has waters with curative powers.
There was a presence of Sikhism in Sylhet Division after Guru Nanak's visit in 1508. Kahn Singh Nabha has stated that in memory of Nanak's visit, Gurdwara Sahib Sylhet was established. This Gurdwara was visited twice by Tegh Bahadur and many hukamnamas were issued to this temple by Guru Gobind Singh. In 1897, the gurdwara fell down after the earthquake. Nearly all the Sikhs of Sylhet in the early 18th century were found in North Cachar where they used to work for the Assam Bengal Railway. There are around 1 lakh Bengali people who follow Sikhism as their religion in both West Bengal and Bangladesh.

Assamese Sikhs
The presence of Sikhism has been existing in Assam for over 200 years. The community traces its origins to the times of Maharaja Ranjit Singh who took his army to Assam and put some influence of the religion towards the locals. According to the 2001 census, there were 22,519 Sikhs in Assam, out of which 4,000 are Assamese Sikhs.
Assamese Sikhs follow the Sikh religion and celebrate Sikh festivals as they also celebrate cultural festivals such as Magh Bihu and wear traditional Assamese dress. Their language is the Assamese language.

Agrahari Sikhs
Agrahari Sikh is a Sikh community found in Bihar and Jharkhand. Agrahari Sikhs, also known as Bihari Sikhs, have existed for centuries in Bihar and Jharkhand.
Bihari Sikhs share their culture with the local Bihari community. The men generally wear the local dhoti and women wear the Sari. They also celebrate Hindu festivals such as the Chath festival.

Dakhni Sikhs
Dakhni Sikhs are from the Deccan Plateau in India located within the states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The traditional dress of women is the sari. The native language of Dakhni Sikhs is the Telugu language.

Kashmiri Sikhs
Ethnic Kashmiri Sikhs speak the Kashmiri language and observe Kashmiri culture. They trace their religious heritage to the influence of Sikh soldiers who settled in Kashmir under the Maharaja Ranjit Singh rule in 1819. However, the soldiers permanently settled in Kashmir.

Pahari Sikhs
Pahari Sikhs, also known as the Sikhs of Poonch, are a distinctive Sikh community hailing from the Poonch region of Pakistan, originally part of the historic region of Jammu and Kashmir. They predominantly speak Pahari Punjabi, a dialect that has evolved in the hilly terrain of their native land. Historically, many Pahari Sikhs resided in the Poonch region but due to various historical and geopolitical factors, a significant number have migrated and settled in the Jammu district of the present-day Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.

Punjabi Sikhs
Punjabi Sikhs are the native Sikhs of undivided Punjab region who speaks the Punjabi language as their mother tongue and practice Punjabi culture. Their traditional dress includes the Punjabi Salwar Suit, Punjabi Tamba and Kurta, Punjabi juti and Patiala salwar.
In addition to the Sikh festivals using the Nanakshahi calendar, Punjabi Sikhs observe traditional Punjabi festivals using the Punjabi calendar.

Sindhi Sikhs
In addition to celebrating Sikh festivals, Sindhi Sikhs celebrate cultural festivals such as Cheti Chand, the Sindhi new year. Sindhi Sikhs speak the Sindhi language. Most of the Sindhi Hindus are Nanak Panthis who believe in 10 Sikh Gurus and regularly go to guru dwara and most of the Marriage also takes place in Gurudwara.

South Indian Sikhs
There are Sikh communities in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra who converted to Sikhism centuries ago.
The Sikhs comprise Banjara and Satnami. The process of blending the religion into southern India for the Sikligars began at the time of 10th Sikh Guru Gobind Singh, who came to the Deccan and died in 1708 at Nanded (Maharashtra).
It all came by the Sikligars as they came to southern India as expert arms-making camp followers of the tenth Guru. Sikligar is a compound of the Persian words 'saiqal' and 'gar' meaning a polisher of metal. The traditional occupation of the Sikligars is crafting kitchen implements.
Banjaras are a nomadic tribe who traditionally travelled with merchandise and are found across a large swathe of northern India, as well as in the south. Sikh Banjaras too travelled with armies of the past supplying them with provisions.

Geographical distribution
Notable Indian Sikhs
Though Sikhs are a minority in India, the community occupies a significant place in the country. The former Chief Justice of India, Jagdish Singh Khehar, and the former Prime Minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh are Sikh, as is former President of India Gyani Zail Singh. Almost every council of ministers in India has included Sikh representatives.
Sikhs are also conspicuous in the Indian army, primarily because of their history as defenders of righteousness, they formed the sword arm of the British empire. The Late Indian officer with a 5 star rank, Arjan Singh, is a Sikh. Sikhs have also led the Indian army through JJ Singh and the Indian Air Force was led by Air Chief Marshal Dilbagh Singh. Sikhs have been prominent in Indian sports, with the Indian individual gold medalist in Olympics, Abhinav Bindra, being a Sikh. Similarly they occupy important official positions, like Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission, Montek Singh Ahluwalia; governor Surjit Singh Barnala.
Sikhs are also known for entrepreneurial business in India. Milkha Singh, also known as The Flying Sikh, is a former Indian track and field sprinter who was introduced to the sport while serving in the Indian Army. One reason for visibility of Sikhs in the Indian spectrum is the disproportionate role played by the Sikh community during the Indian freedom struggle, with Bhagat Singh remaining a youth icon to Indian youth.

Secularism
The Constitution of India, declares India to be a secular state with no state religion. The Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India enacted in 1976 asserts the Preamble to the Constitution of India as secular. The Supreme Court of India in the 1994 case S. R. Bommai v. Union of India established that India had been secular since the formation of the Republic on 26 January 1950. Secularism in India is understood to mean not a complete separation of religion from state, but a state that participates in a neutral manner in the affairs of all religious groups and as well as atheism while maintaining equidistance from all.
However, the original copy of the Indian constitution has an illustration of Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana in Part III on Fundamental Rights and Rama has been considered as the true guardian of people's rights. Article 48 of the Indian constitution prohibits the slaughter of cows or calves (a sacred animal in Hinduism) and the same is a criminal offense in most states of India.
Secularism is defined as a basic structure doctrine of the constitution through the argument of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala case, that cannot be removed or amended by any means. However, there is no mention of the term “Basic Structure” anywhere in the Constitution of India. The idea that the Parliament cannot introduce laws that would amend the basic structure of the constitution have been evolved judicially over time and many cases.
The particular provisions regarding secularism and freedom of religion in India in the constitution are:

Article 14: grants equality before the law and equal protection of the laws to all.
Article 15: enlarges the concept of secularism to the widest possible extent by prohibiting discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.
Article 25: Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of any religion.
Article 26: Freedom to manage religious affairs.
Article 27: Freedom as to payment of taxes for promotion of any particular religion.
Article 28: Freedom as to attendance at religious instruction or religious worship in certain educational institutions.
Articles 29 and 30: provide cultural and educational rights to the minorities.
Article 51A: i.e. Fundamental Duties obliges all the citizens to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood and to value and preserve the heritage of the country's composite diverse culture.

History
Prehistoric religion
Evidence attesting to prehistoric religion in the Indian ""subcontinent"" derives from scattered Mesolithic rock paintings depicting dances and rituals. Neolithic pastoralists inhabiting the Indus Valley buried their dead in a manner suggestive of spiritual practices that incorporated notions of an afterlife. Other South Asian Stone Age sites, such as the Bhimbetka rock shelters in central Madhya Pradesh and the Kupgal petroglyphs of eastern Karnataka, contain rock art portraying religious rites and evidence of possible ritualised music.

Indus Valley Civilization
The Harappan people of the Indus Valley Civilisation, which lasted from 3300 to 1400 BCE and was centered on the Indus and Ghaggar-Hakra river valleys, may have worshiped an important mother goddess symbolising fertility. Excavations of Indus Valley Civilisation sites show seals with animals and ""fire‑altars"", indicating rituals associated with fire. A Shivlinga of a type similar to that which is now worshiped by Hindus has also been found, however this interpretation has been disputed by Srinivasan.

Evolution of Hinduism
Hinduism is often regarded as the oldest surviving religion in the world, with roots tracing back to prehistoric times, over 5,000 years ago. Hinduism spread through parts of Southeastern Asia, China, and Afghanistan. Hindus worship a single divine entity (paramatma, lit.""first-soul"") with different forms.

Hinduism's origins include the cultural elements of the Indus Valley Civilisation along with other Indian civilisations. The oldest surviving text of Hinduism is the Rigveda, produced during the Vedic period and dating to 1700–1100 BCE. During the Epic and Puranic periods, the earliest versions of the epic poems, in their current form including Ramayana and Mahabharata were written roughly from 500 to 100 BCE, although these were orally transmitted through families for centuries prior to this period.
After 200 BCE, several schools of thought were formally codified in the Indian philosophy, including Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Purva-Mimamsa, and Vedanta.

Rise of Shramana Religions
The Śramaṇa tradition includes Jainism, known endonymically as Jain Dharm, and Buddhism known endonymically as Bauddh Dharm, and others such as the Ājīvikas, Ajñanas, and others.
The historical roots of Jainism in India have been traced to the 9th century BCE with the rise of Parshvanatha, the 23rd Tirthankar, and his Jain philosophy, and to Mahavira (599–527 BCE), the 24th Jain Tirthankara. Jainism traces its roots further back to the first Tirthankara, Rishabhanatha. Mahavira stressed on the five vows.
Gautama Buddha, who founded Buddhism, was born to the Shakya clan just before Magadha (which lasted from 546 to 324 BCE) rose to power. His family was native to the plains of Lumbini, in what is now southern Nepal. Indian Buddhism peaked during the reign of Ashoka the Great of the Mauryan Empire, who patronised Buddhism following his conversion and unified the Indian subcontinent in the 3rd century BCE. He sent missionaries abroad, allowing Buddhism to spread across Asia. Indian Buddhism declined following the loss of royal patronage offered by the Kushan Empire and such kingdoms as Magadha and Kosala.
The decline of Buddhism in India has been attributed to a variety of factors, which include the resurgence of Hinduism in the 10th and 11th centuries under Sankaracharya, the later Turkish invasion, the Buddhist focus on renunciation as opposed to familial values and private property, Hinduism's own use and appropriation of Buddhist and Jain ideals of renunciation and ahimsa, and others. Although Buddhism virtually disappeared from mainstream India by the 11th century CE, its presence remained and manifested itself through other movements such as the Bhakti tradition, Vaishnavism, and the Bauls of Bengal, who are influenced by the Sahajjyana form of Buddhism that was popular in Bengal during the Pala period.

Bhakti Movement
During the 14th–17th centuries, when North India was under Muslim rule, the Bhakti movement swept through Central and Northern India. The Bhakti movement actually started in the eighth century in south India (present-day Tamil Nadu and Kerala), and gradually spread northwards. It was initiated by a loosely associated group of teachers or saints. Dnyaneshwar, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Vallabhacharya, Surdas, Meera Bai, Kabir, Tulsidas, Ravidas, Namdeo, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram, and other mystics were some of the saints in the North. They taught that people could cast aside the heavy burdens of ritual and caste and the subtle complexities of philosophy, and simply express their overwhelming love for God. This period was also characterized by an abundance of devotional literature in vernacular prose and poetry in the ethnic languages of the various Indian states or provinces. The Bhakti movement gave rise to several different movements throughout India
During the Bhakti movement, many Hindu groups regarded as outside the traditional Hindu caste system followed Bhakti traditions by worshipping/following saints belonging to their respective communities. For example, Guru Ravidas was a Chamar of Uttar Pradesh; Guru Parsuram Ramnami was a Chura of Chhattisgarh, and Maharishi Ram Naval was a Bhangi of Rajasthan. In their lifetimes, several of these saints even went to the extent of fighting conversion from foreign missionaries, encouraging only Hinduism within their communities. In Assam for example, tribals were led by Gurudev Kalicharan Bramha of the Brahmo Samaj; in Nagaland by Kacha Naga; and in Central India by Birsa Munda, Hanuman Aaron, Jatra Bhagat, and Budhu Bhagat.

Kabir Sect
The Kabir Panth is a religious movement based on the teachings of the Indian poet saint Kabir (1398–1518). 
Kabir sermonized a monotheism that appealed clearly to the poor and convinced them of their access to god with no liaison. He denied both Hinduism and Islam, as well as meaningless religious rituals, and condemned double standards. This infuriated the orthodox aristocracy. No one could frighten Kabir who was bold enough to stand up for himself and his beliefs.
The Kabir Panth considers Kabir as its principal guru or even as a divinity—truth incarnate. Kabir's influence is testimony to his massive authority, even for those whose beliefs and practices he condemned so unsparingly. For Sikhs he is a forerunner and converser of Nanak, the originating Sikh Guru (spiritual guide). Muslims place him in Sufi (mystical) lineages, and for Hindus he becomes a Vaishnavite with universalist leanings.

Sikhism
Guru Nanak Dev Ji (1469–1539) was the founder of Sikhism, known endonymically as Sikh Dharm. The Guru Granth Sahib was first compiled by the fifth Sikh guru, Guru Arjan Dev, from the writings of the first five Sikh gurus and others saints who preached the concept of universal brotherhood, including those of the Hindu and Muslim faith. Before the death of Guru Gobind Singh, the Guru Granth Sahib was declared the eternal guru. Sikhism recognises all humans as equal before Waheguru, regardless of colour, caste, or lineage. Sikhism strongly rejects the beliefs of fasting (vrata), superstitions, idol worship, and circumcision. The Sikhs believe in one eternal god and follow the teachings of the 10 gurus, the 5 K's of Sikhism, the hukums of Guru Gobind Singh, Sikh Rehat Maryada, and Nitnem.

Introduction of Abrahamic religions
Judaism
Jews first arrived as traders from Judea in the city of Kochi, Kerala, in 562 BCE. More Jews came as exiles from Jerusalem in the year 70 CE, after the destruction of the Second Temple.

Christianity
Christianity was introduced to India by Thomas the Apostle (a direct disciple of Jesus Christ), who visited Muziris in Kerala in 52 CE and proselytised natives, who are known as Saint Thomas Christians (also known as Syrian Christians or Nasrani) today. India's oldest church, the world's oldest existing church structure and built by Thomas the Apostle in 57 CE, called Thiruvithamcode Arappally or Thomaiyar or Kovil as named by the then Chera king Udayancheral, is located at Thiruvithancode in Kanyakumari (Cape Comorin) district of Tamil Nadu, it was declared an international St Thomas Pilgrim Centre. There is a general scholarly consensus that Christianity was rooted in India by the 6th century CE, including some communities who used Syriac liturgically. Christianity in India consists of various denominations such as the Assyrian Church, Catholicism, Protestantism, Oriental Orthodoxy and others.
Most Christians live in South India, particularly in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Goa, & the average number of Christians is at 3.45% in areas such as Bombay (Mumbai). There are also large Christian populations in Northeast India. Catholic Christianity was spread in the 16th century, particularly by the Portuguese in Goa and Bombay. Protestantism was introduced by Protestant missionaries in the 18th century.

Islam
Islam came to India in the early 7th century through the Arab traders in Malabar coast. It started to become a major religion during the Muslim rule in the Indian subcontinent. The Cheraman Juma Mosque is the first mosque in India located in Methala, Kodungallur Taluk, Thrissur District in Kerala. A legend claims that it was built in 629 CE, which makes it the oldest mosque in the Indian subcontinent which is still in use. The growth of Islam in India mostly took place under the Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526) and the Mughal Empire (1526–1858), greatly aided by the mystic Sufi tradition. The growth of Islam was regionally uneven, and Islam had the greatest appeal to those who were not, or only superficially integrated into the Brahmanical fold, as in the case of Bengal.
Currently, Islam is the second largest religion in India, with 14.2% of the country's population or roughly 172 million people identifying as adherents of Islam (2011 census). The estimated number of Muslims in India for 2024 is projected to be around 204,760,392.
It makes India the country with the largest Muslim population outside Muslim-majority countries.

Census statistics
There are six religions in India which have been awarded ""National minority"" status—Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, and Zoroastrians (Parsis).

The following is a breakdown of India's religious communities:

Note: When compared with 2001, India's population rose by 17.7% in 2011 with an average sex ratio of 943 and a literacy rate of 74.4%. The average work participation stood at 39.79%.

Religions
Hinduism
Hinduism is an ancient religion with the largest religious grouping in India, with around 966 million adherents as of 2011, composing 79.8% of the population. Hinduism is diverse, with monotheism, henotheism, polytheism, panentheism, pantheism, monism, atheism, animism, agnosticism, and gnosticism being represented. The term Hindu, originally a geographical description, derives from the Sanskrit, Sindhu, (the historical appellation for the Indus River), and refers to a person from the land of the river Sindhu. Hindus following the traditional religion call it Sanatana Dharma (or ""Eternal Way""). The adherents of Sanatana Dharma call themselves as ""Sanatani"", the original word for the adherents of Sanatana Dharma.

Islam
Islam is a monotheistic religion centered on the belief in one God and following the example of Muhammad; it is the largest minority religion in India. About 14.2% of the country's population or approx. 172.2 million people identify as adherents of Islam (2011 census). It makes India the country with the largest Muslim population outside Muslim-majority countries. Muslims are a majority in states Jammu and Kashmir and Lakshadweep, and live in high concentrations in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, and Kerala. There has been no particular census conducted in India with regards to sects, but sources suggest the largest denomination is Sunni Islam, with substantial populations of Shia and Ahmadiyya Muslims. Indian sources like Times of India and DNA reported the Indian Shia Muslims population in mid-2005–2006 to be between 25% and 31% of entire Muslim population of India, which accounts them in numbers between 40 and 50 million.

Christianity
Christianity is a monotheistic religion centred on the life and teachings of Jesus as presented in the New Testament. It is the third largest religion of India, making up 2.3% of the population. St. Thomas is credited with introduction of Christianity in India. He arrived on the Malabar Coast in 52 CE. 
The tradition of origin among Saint Thomas Christians relates to the arrival of Saint Thomas, one of the 12 disciples of Jesus at the ancient seaport Muziris on the Kerala coast in 52 CE. The families Sankaramangalam, Pakalomattam, Kalli, and Kaliyankal were considered particularly preeminent, and historically the most aristocratic Syriac Christian families tended to claim descent from these families.
It is also possible for Aramaic-speaking Jews from Galilee to make a trip to Kerala in the 1st century. The Cochin Jews are known to have existed in Kerala around that time. The earliest known source connecting the apostle to India is the Acts of Thomas, likely written in the early 3rd century, perhaps in Edessa.
Marth Mariam Syro-Malabar Catholic Forane Church, Arakuzha was founded in 999.
The text describes Thomas' adventures in bringing Christianity to India, a tradition later expanded upon in early Indian sources such as the ""Thomma Parvam"" (""Song of Thomas""). Generally he is described as arriving in or around Maliankara and founding Seven Churches and half churches, or Ezharapallikal: Kodungallur, Kollam, Niranam, Nilackal (Chayal), Kokkamangalam, Kottakkavu, Palayoor, Thiruvithamcode Arappalli and Aruvithura church (half church). A number of 3rd- and 4th-century Roman writers also mention Thomas' trip to India, including Ambrose of Milan, Gregory of Nazianzus, Jerome, and Ephrem the Syrian, while Eusebius of Caesarea records that his teacher Pantaenus visited a Christian community in India in the 2nd century. There came into existence a Christian community who were mainly merchants.
Christianity expanded in the rest of India during the period of British colonial rule. Christians constitute the majority of natives of Nagaland and Mizoram as well as of Meghalaya and have significant populations in Manipur, Goa, Kerala and Mumbai.

Sikhism
Sikhism is a monotheistic religion began in fifteenth-century Punjab with the teachings of Guru Nanak and nine successive Sikh gurus. As of 2011, there were 20.8 million Sikhs in India. Punjab is the spiritual home of Sikhs, and is the only state in India where Sikhs form a majority. There are also significant populations of Sikhs in neighboring Chandigarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu division of Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi, and Haryana. These areas were historically a part of Greater Punjab. However, there is no data for specific number of Nanak followers (Nanakpanthis) in India, but they are believed to be in crores somewhere around 14 crores. Karnail Singh Panjoli, member, Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, says that there are several communities within the term ‘Nanakpanthis’ too. “There are groups like Sikhligarh, Vanjaarey, Nirmaley, Lubaney, Johri, Satnamiye, Udaasiyas etc. who call themselves Nanakpanthis. They follow guru Nanak and Sri Guru Granth Sahib.

Buddhism
Buddhism is an Indian, transtheistic religion and philosophy. Around 8.5 million Buddhists live in India, about 0.7% of the total population. Buddhism as a religion is practised mainly in the foothills of the Himalayas and is a significant religion in Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Ladakh, Darjeeling in West Bengal, and the Lahaul and Spiti districts of Himachal Pradesh. Besides, a significant number of Buddhists reside in Maharashtra. They are the Buddhists or Navayana Buddhists who, under the influence of B. R. Ambedkar embraced Buddhism in order to escape the casteist practices within Hinduism. Ambedkar is a crucial figure, along with Anagarika Dharmapala of Sri Lanka and Kripasaran Mahasthavira of Chittagong behind the revival of Buddhism in India in the 19th and 20th centuries. The escape of the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzing Gyatso to India fleeing Chinese occupation of Tibet in 1959 and the setting up of the Tibetan Government in Exile at Dharamshala in Mcleodganj in Himachal Pradesh has also accelerated the resurgence of Buddhism in India. The effective religion in Sikkim, which joined the Indian Union in 1975 (making it India's 22nd state) remains Vajrayana Buddhism, and Padmasambhava or Guru Ugyen is a revered presence there.

Jainism
Jainism is a non-theistic Indian religion and philosophical system originating in Iron Age India. Jains compose 0.4% (around 4.45 million) of India's population, and are concentrated in the states of Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan.

Judaism
Also present in India, Judaism is a monotheistic religion from the Levant. There is today a very small community of Indian Jews. There were more Jews in India historically, including the Cochin Jews of Kerala, the Bene Israel of Maharashtra, and the Baghdadi Jews near Mumbai. Since Indian independence, two primarily proselyte Indian Jewish communities have developed in India: the Bnei Menashe of Mizoram and Manipur, and the Bene Ephraim, also called Telugu Jews. Of the approximately 95,000 Jews of Indian extraction, fewer than 20,000 remain in India. Some parts of India are especially popular with Israelis, swelling local Jewish populations seasonally.

Other religions
As of the census of 2001, Parsis (followers of Zoroastrianism in India) represent approximately 0.006% of the total population of India, with relatively high concentrations in and around the city of Mumbai. Parsis number around 61,000 in India.
There are several tribal religions in India, such as Donyi-Polo. Santhal is also one of the many tribal religions followed by the Santhal people who number around 4 million but only around 23,645 follow the religion.
It is difficult to establish the exact numbers of Baháʼís in India. The religion came to India from Iran in about 1850 and gained some converts from the Muslim population of India. The first Sikh and Hindu converts came by 1910, and in 1960 there were fewer than 1,000 Baháʼís in all of India. Beginning in 1961, large numbers from scheduled castes became Baháʼís, and by 1993 Baháʼís reported about 2.2 million members, though later sources have claimed 2 million, or ""more than 1 million"".

Atheism
Around 2.9 million people in India did not state their religion in the 2011 census and were counted in the category, ""religion not stated"". They were 0.24% of India's population. Their number have significantly increased 4 times from 0.7 million in 2001 census at an average annual rate of 15%. K. Veeramani, a Dravidar Kazhagam leader, said that he believed that the number of atheists in India was actually higher as many people don't reveal their atheism out of fear.
According to the 2012 WIN-Gallup Global Index of Religion and Atheism report, 81% of Indians were religious, 13% were non-religious, 3% were convinced atheists, and 3% were unsure or did not respond.

Law
The preamble to the Constitution of India proclaims India a ""sovereign socialist secular democratic republic"". The word secular was inserted into the Preamble by the Forty-second Amendment Act of 1976. It mandates equal treatment and tolerance of all religions. India does not have an official state religion; it enshrines the right to practice, preach, and propagate any religion. No religious instruction is imparted in government-supported schools. In S. R. Bommai v. Union of India, the Supreme Court of India held that secularism was an integral tenet of the Constitution and that there was separation of state and religion.
Freedom of religion is a fundamental right according to the Indian Constitution. The Constitution also suggests a uniform civil code for its citizens as a Directive Principle. This has not been implemented until now as Directive Principles are Constitutionally unenforceable. The Supreme Court has further held that the enactment of a uniform civil code all at once may be counter-productive to the unity of the nation, and only a gradual progressive change should be brought about (Pannalal Bansilal v State of Andhra Pradesh, 1996). In Maharishi Avadesh v Union of India (1994) the Supreme Court dismissed a petition seeking a writ of mandamus against the government to introduce a common civil code, and thus laid the responsibility of its introduction on the legislature.
Major religious communities not based in India continue to be governed by their own personal laws. Whilst Muslims, Christians, Zoroastrians, and Jews have personal laws exclusive to themselves; Hindus, Jains, Buddhists, and Sikhs are governed by a single personal law known as Hindu personal law. Article 25 (2)(b) of the Constitution of India states that references to Hindus include ""persons professing the Sikh, Jain, or Buddhist religion"". Furthermore, the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 defines the legal status of Jains, Buddhists, and Sikhs as legal Hindus but not ""Hindus by religion"". Supreme Court in 2005 gave verdict that Jains, Sikhs, and Buddhist are part of broader Hindu fold, as they are Indic religions and interconnected to each other, though they are distinct religions.

Aspects
Religion plays a major role in the Indian way of life. Rituals, worship, and other religious activities are very prominent in an individual's daily life; it is also a principal organizer of social life. The degree of religiosity varies amongst individuals; in recent decades, religious orthodoxy and observances have become less common in Indian society, particularly amongst young urban-dwellers.

Rituals
The vast majority of Indians engage in religious rituals daily. Most Hindus observe religious rituals at home. Observation of rituals vary greatly amongst regions, villages, and individuals. Devout Hindus perform daily chores such as worshiping puja, fire sacrifice called Yajna at the dawn after bathing (usually at a family shrine, and typically includes lighting a lamp and offering foods before the images of deities), recitation from religious scripts like Vedas, and Puranas singing hymns in praise of gods.
A notable feature in religious ritual is the division between purity and pollution. Religious acts presuppose some degree of impurity, or defilement for the practitioner, which must be overcome or neutralized, before or during ritual procedures. Purification, usually with water, is thus a typical feature of most religious action. Other characteristics include a belief in the efficacy of sacrifice and concept of merit, gained through the performance of charity or good works, that will accumulate over time and reduce sufferings in the next world.
Muslims offer five daily prayers at specific times of the day, indicated by adhan (call to prayer) from the local mosques. Before offering prayers, they must ritually clean themselves by performing wudu, which involves washing parts of the body that are generally exposed to dirt or dust. A recent study by the Sachar Committee found that 3–4% of Muslim children study in madrasas (Islamic schools).

Diet
Dietary habits in India are significantly influenced by religion. According to a survey, 31% of Indian population claims to be vegetarian, and mainly practice lacto-vegetarianism. Vegetarianism is less common among Sikhs, Muslims, Christians, Bahá'ís, Parsis, and Jews.Despite the majority of population having no objection to meat consumption, globally India has the lowest meat consumption per capita. Non-vegetarian Indians mostly prefer poultry, fish, other seafood, goat, and sheep as their sources of meat. Hinduism forbids beef whilst Islam forbids pork. The smaller populations of Christians, tribals, and some dalit communities have no objection to eating either beef or pork. 
Jainism requires followers, from all its sects and traditions, to be vegetarian. Furthermore, the religion also forbids 
Jains from eating any vegetable that involves digging it from the ground. This rule, therefore, excludes all Root vegetables such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, ginger, carrots, garlic, radishes, etc. from a Jain diet.

Ceremonies
Occasions like birth, marriage, and death involve what are often elaborate sets of religious customs. In Hinduism, major life-cycle rituals include annaprashan (a baby's first intake of solid food), upanayanam (""sacred thread ceremony"" undergone by boys belonging to some upper-castes such as Brahmin and Kshatriya only), and shraadh (paying homage to a deceased individual). According to the findings of a 1995 national research paper, for most people in India, a betrothal of a young couple placing an expectation upon an exact date and time of a future wedding was a matter decided by the parents in consultation with astrologers. A significant reduction in the proportion of arranged marriages has however taken place since 1995, reflecting an incremental change.
Muslims practice a series of life-cycle rituals that differ from those of Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists. Several rituals mark the first days of life—including the whispering call to prayer, first bath, and shaving of the head. Religious instruction begins early. Male circumcision usually takes place after birth; in some families, it may be delayed until after the onset of puberty.
Marriage requires a payment by the husband to the wife, called Meher, and the solemnization of a marital contract in a social gathering. After the burial of the dead, friends and relatives gather to console the bereaved, read and recite the Quran, and pray for the soul of the deceased. Indian Islam is distinguished by the emphasis it places on shrines commemorating great Sufi saints.

Pilgrimages
Many Hindu families have their own family patron deity or the kuladevata. This deity is common to a lineage or a clan of several families who are connected to each other through a common ancestor. The Khandoba of Jejuri is an example of a Kuladevata of some Maharashtrian families; he is a common Kuladevata to several castes ranging from Brahmins to Dalits. The practice of worshipping local or territorial deities as Kuladevata began in the period of the Yadava dynasty. Other family deities of the people of Maharashtra are Bhavani of Tuljapur, Mahalaxmi of Kolhapur, Renuka of Mahur, and Balaji of Tirupati.
India hosts numerous pilgrimage sites belonging to many religions. Hindus worldwide recognise several Indian holy cities, including Allahabad (officially known as Prayagraj), Haridwar, Varanasi, Ujjain, Rameshwaram, and Vrindavan. Notable temple cities include Puri, which hosts a major Jagannath temple and Rath Yatra celebration; Tirumala - Tirupati, home to the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple; and Katra, home to the Vaishno Devi temple.
Badrinath, Puri, Dwarka, and Rameswaram compose the main pilgrimage circuit of Char Dham (four abodes) hosting the four holiest Hindu temples: Badrinath Temple, Jagannath Temple, Dwarkadheesh Temple and Ramanathaswamy Temple, respectively. The Himalayan towns of Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, and Yamunotri compose the smaller Chota Char Dham (mini four abodes) pilgrimage circuit. The Kumbh Mela (the ""pitcher festival"") is one of the holiest of Hindu pilgrimages that is held every four years; the location is rotated amongst Allahabad (Prayagraj), Haridwar, Nashik, and Ujjain. The Thalaimaippathi at Swamithope is the leading pilgrim center for the Ayyavazhis.
Seven of the Eight Great Places of Buddhism are in India. Bodh Gaya, Sarnath, and Kushinagar are the places where important events in the life of Gautama Buddha took place. Sanchi hosts a Buddhist stupa erected by the emperor Ashoka. Many Buddhist monasteries dot the Himalayan foothills of India, where Buddhism remains a major presence. These include the Rumtek Monastery, Enchey Monastery, and Pemayangtse Monastery in Sikkim, the Tawang Monastery in Arunachal Pradesh, the Kye Monastery and Tabo Monastery in Spiti, the Ghum Monastery in Darjeeling, and Durpin Dara Monastery in Kalimpong, the Thikse Monastery in Leh, the Namgyal Monastery in Dharamshala, among many others.
For Sunni Muslims, the Dargah Shareef of Khwaza Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer is a major pilgrimage site. Other Islamic pilgrimages include those to the Tomb of Sheikh Salim Chishti in Fatehpur Sikri, Jama Masjid in Delhi, and to Haji Ali Dargah in Mumbai. Dilwara Temples in Mount Abu, Palitana, Pavapuri, Girnar, and Shravanabelagola are notable pilgrimage sites (tirtha) in Jainism.
The Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar is the most sacred gurdwara of Sikhism.
Relatively new pilgrimage sites include the samadhi of Meher Baba in Meherabad, which is visited by his followers from around the world and the Saibaba temple in Shirdi.

Minority beliefs and sects
Hinduism contains many different sub-cultures just like most other religions. The major aspects outlined above hold true for the majority of the Hindu population, but not all. Just as each state is home to an individual language, Hinduism harbors various sub-cultures whose traditions may or may not be shared by other Indians. A sect from Gujarat called the Prajapatis for example, holds water as the sacred ornament to every meal. Before and after a meal, an individual is expected to pour water in the palms of their right hand and sip the water three times. This is often seen as a purification gesture: food is regarded as being holy and every individual must purify themselves before touching their food.
Other minor sects in India carry no specific name, but they are uniquely identified by the last names of each family. This convention is used more frequently in South India than in North India. For example, a relatively prominent sect in southern India prohibits making important decisions, commencing new tasks, and doing other intellectually or spiritually engaged actions after sunset. Historians believe that this tradition was derived from the concept of Rahukaalam, in which Hindus believe that a specific period of the day is inauspicious. Stringent family beliefs are thought to have led to the development of a more constrained religious hierarchy. Over time, this belief was extended to discourage taking major actions and even staying awake for long periods after sunset. Examples of families which follow this tradition include Gudivada, Padalapalli, Pantham, and Kashyap.

Religiosity
India has a population of 123 crore per a 2012 demographic survey by Indian government. According to the 2012 WIN-Gallup Global Index of Religion and Atheism report, 81% of Indians were religious, 13% were non-religious, 3% were convinced atheists, and 3% were unsure or did not respond.
Cambridge University Press in 2004 demographic study, have found that there are 102.87 million atheists and agnostics living in India, thus constituting 
9.1% of the total population, out of total 1.1296 billion people respectively.

Religion and politics
Politics
Religious politics, particularly that expressed by the Hindutva movement, has strongly influenced Indian politics in the last quarter of the 20th century. Many of the elements underlying India's casteism and communalism originated during the colonial era, when the colonial government frequently politicized religion in an attempt to stave off increasing nationalistic sentiments in India. The Indian Councils Act 1909 (widely known as the Morley-Minto Reforms Act), which established separate Hindu and Muslim electorates for the Imperial Legislature and provincial councils, was particularly divisive, increasing tensions between the two communities.
Due to the high degree of oppression faced by the lower castes, the Constitution of India included provisions for affirmative action for certain sections of Indian society. Many states ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) introduced laws that made conversion more difficult; they assert that such conversions are often forced or allured. The BJP, a national political party, also gained widespread media attention after its leaders associated themselves with the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and other prominent religious issues.
A well-known accusation that Indian political parties make for their rivals is that they play vote bank politics, meaning give political support to issues for the sole purpose of gaining the votes of members of a particular community. Both the Congress Party and the BJP have been accused of exploiting the people by indulging in vote bank politics. The Shah Bano case, a divorce lawsuit, generated much controversy when the Congress was accused of appeasing the Muslim orthodoxy by bringing in a parliamentary amendment to negate the Supreme Court's decision. After the 2002 Gujarat violence, there were allegations of political parties indulging in vote bank politics. All the political parties in India are known to grant money to the State Waqf Boards to appease a particular community.
Caste-based politics is also important in India; caste-based discrimination and the reservation system continue to be major issues that are hotly debated.

Communalism
Communalism has played a key role in shaping the religious history of modern India. After Indian independence in 1947, India was partitioned along religious lines into two states—the Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan (comprising what is now the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the People's Republic of Bangladesh) and the Hindu-majority Union of India (later the Republic of India). The partition led to rioting amongst Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs in Punjab, Bengal, Delhi, and other parts of India; 500,000 died as a result of the violence. The twelve million refugees that moved between the newly founded nations of India and Pakistan composed one of the largest mass migrations in modern history. Since its independence, India has periodically witnessed large-scale violence sparked by underlying tensions between sections of its majority Hindu and minority Muslim communities. The Republic of India is secular; the Indian government recognizes no official religion.

Communal conflicts
Communal conflicts have periodically plagued India since it became independent in 1947. The roots of such strife lie largely in the underlying tensions between sections of its majority Hindu and minority Muslim communities, which emerged under the Raj and during the bloody Partition of India. Such conflict also stems from the competing ideologies of Hindu nationalism versus Islamic fundamentalism; both are prevalent in parts of the Hindu and Muslim populations. This issue has plagued India since before independence. The lack of education among the masses and the ease with which corrupt politicians can take advantage of the same has been attributed as the major reason for religious conflicts in India. Even though Freedom of religion is an integral part of the India constitution, the inability to hold a communal mob accountable for its collectove actions has limited the exercise of religious freedom in India.
Alongside other major Indian independence leaders, Mahatma Gandhi and his Shanti sainiks (""peace soldiers"") worked to quell early outbreaks of religious conflict in Bengal, including riots in Calcutta (now in West Bengal) and Noakhali District (in modern-day Bangladesh) that accompanied Muhammad Ali Jinnah's Direct Action Day, which was launched on 16 August 1946. These conflicts, waged largely with rocks and knives and accompanied by widespread looting and arson, were crude affairs. Explosives and firearms, which are rarely found in India, were far less likely to be used.
Major post-independence communal conflicts include the 1984 Anti-Sikh riots, which followed Operation Blue Star by the Indian Army; heavy artillery, tanks, and helicopters were employed against the Sikh partisans inside the Harmandir Sahib, causing heavy damage to Sikhism's holiest Gurdwara. According to the Indian government estimates, the assault caused the deaths of up to 100 soldiers, 250 militants, and hundreds of civilians.
This triggered Indira Gandhi's assassination by her outraged Sikh bodyguards on 31 October 1984, which set off a four-day period during which Sikhs were massacred; The Government of India reported 2,700 Sikh deaths however human rights organizations and newspapers report the death toll to be 10,000–17,000. In the aftermath of the riot, the Government of India reported 20,000 had fled the city, however the PUCL reported ""at least"" 50,000 displaced persons.
The most affected regions were neighbourhoods in Delhi. Human rights organisations and the newspapers believe the massacre was organised. The collusion of political officials in the massacres and the failure to prosecute any killers alienated normal Sikhs and increased support for the Khalistan movement. The Akal Takht, the governing religious body of Sikhism, considers the killings to be a genocide.
Other incidents include the 1992 Bombay riots that followed the demolition of the Babri Mosque as a result of the Ayodhya debate, and the 2002 Gujarat violence where 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed and which was preceded by the Godhra Train Burning. Lesser incidents plague many towns and villages; the representative was the killing of five people in Mau, Uttar Pradesh during Hindu-Muslim rioting, which was triggered by the proposed celebration of a Hindu festival.

History
Jain doctrine teaches that Jainism has always existed and will always exist. Like most ancient Indian religions, Jainism has its roots from the Indus Valley civilization, reflecting native spirituality prior to the Indo-Aryan migration into India. Other scholars suggested the Shramana traditions were separate and contemporaneous with Indo-Aryan religious practices of the historical Vedic religion. In August 2005, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Jainism, Sikhism (and Buddhism) are distinct religions but are inter-connected and inter-related to Hinduism, so these three are part of wider broader Hindu religion, based on the historic background on how the Constitution had come into existence after. However, in the 2006 verdict, the Supreme Court found that the ""Jain Religion is indisputably not a part of the Hindu Religion"".

Status in India
On January 20, 2014, the Government of India awarded the minority status to the Jain community in India, as per Section 2(c) of the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) Act (NCM), 1992. This made the Jain community, which makes for 9.5 million or 0.72 percent of the population as per 2011 census, the sixth community to be designated this status as a ""national minority"", after Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Parsis. Though Jains already had minority status in 11 states of India including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, in 2005 a petition was filed with Supreme Court of India, by community representatives, which was also backed by the National Minorities Commission. In its judgement the court left the decision to the Central government.

Among the world's oldest organized faiths, its adherents exalt an uncreated, benevolent, and all-wise deity known as Ahura Mazda (𐬀𐬵𐬎𐬭𐬋 𐬨𐬀𐬰𐬛𐬃), who is hailed as the supreme being of the universe. Opposed to Ahura Mazda is Angra Mainyu (𐬀𐬢𐬭𐬀⸱𐬨𐬀𐬌𐬥𐬌𐬌𐬎), who is personified as a destructive spirit and the adversary of all things that are good. As such, the Zoroastrian religion combines a dualistic cosmology of good and evil with an eschatological outlook predicting the ultimate triumph of Ahura Mazda over evil. Opinions vary among scholars as to whether Zoroastrianism is monotheistic, polytheistic, henotheistic, or a combination of all three. Zoroastrianism shaped Iranian culture and history, while scholars differ on whether it significantly influenced ancient Western philosophy and the Abrahamic religions, or gradually reconciled with other religions and traditions, such as Christianity and Islam.
Originating from Zoroaster's reforms of the ancient Iranian religion, Zoroastrianism began during the Avestan period (possibly as early as the 2nd millennium BCE), but was first recorded in the mid-6th century BCE. For the following millennium, it was the official religion of successive Iranian polities, beginning with the Achaemenid Empire, which formalized and institutionalized many of its tenets and rituals, and ending with the Sasanian Empire, which revitalized the faith and standardized its teachings. In the 7th century CE, the rise of Islam and the ensuing Muslim conquest of Iran marked the beginning of the decline of Zoroastrianism. The persecution of Zoroastrians by the early Muslims in the nascent Rashidun Caliphate prompted much of the community to migrate to the Indian subcontinent, where they were granted asylum and became the progenitors of today's Parsis. Once numbering in the millions, the world's total Zoroastrian population is estimated to comprise between 100,000 and 200,000 people as of 2024. Most Zoroastrians reside either in India (50,000–60,000), in Iran (15,000–25,000), or in North America (22,000). The religion is thought to be declining due to restrictions on conversion, strict endogamy, and low birth rates.
The central beliefs and practices of Zoroastrianism are contained in the Avesta, a compendium of sacred texts assembled over several centuries. Its oldest and most central component are the Gathas, purported to be the direct teachings of Zoroaster and his account of conversations with Ahura Mazda. These writings are part of a major section of the Avesta called the Yasna, which forms the core of Zoroastrian liturgy. Zoroaster's religious philosophy divided the early Iranian gods of Proto-Indo-Iranian paganism into emanations of the natural world—the ahura and the daeva; the former class consisting of divinities to be revered and the latter class consisting of divinities to be rejected and condemned. Zoroaster proclaimed that Ahura Mazda was the supreme creator and sustaining force of the universe, working in gētīg (the visible material realm) and mēnōg (the invisible spiritual and mental realm) through the Amesha Spenta, a class of seven divine entities that represent various aspects of the universe and the highest moral good. Emanating from Ahura Mazda is Spenta Mainyu (the Holy or Bountiful Spirit), the source of life and goodness, which is opposed by Angra Mainyu (the Destructive or Opposing Spirit), who is born from Aka Manah (evil thought). Angra Mainyu was further developed by Middle Persian literature into Ahriman (𐭠𐭧𐭫𐭬𐭭𐭩), Ahura Mazda's direct adversary.
Zoroastrian doctrine holds that, within this cosmic dichotomy, human beings have the choice between Asha (truth, cosmic order), the principle of righteousness or ""rightness"" that is promoted and embodied by Ahura Mazda, and Druj (falsehood, deceit), the essential nature of Angra Mainyu that expresses itself as greed, wrath, and envy. Thus, the central moral precepts of the religion are good thoughts (hwnata), good words (hakhta), and good deeds (hvarshta), which are recited in many prayers and ceremonies. Many of the practices and beliefs of ancient Iranian religion can still be seen in Zoroastrianism, such as reverence for nature and its elements, such as water (aban). Fire (atar) is held by Zoroastrians to be particularly sacred as a symbol of Ahura Mazda himself, serving as a focal point of many ceremonies and rituals, and serving as the basis for Zoroastrian places of worship, which are known as fire temples.","Zoroastrianism (Persian: دین زرتشتی Dīn-e Zartoshtī), also called Mazdayasnā (Avestan: 𐬨𐬀𐬰𐬛𐬀𐬌𐬌𐬀𐬯𐬥𐬀) or Beh-dīn (بهدین), is an Iranian religion centred on the Avesta and the teachings of Zarathushtra Spitama, who is more commonly referred to by the Greek translation, Zoroaster (Greek: Ζωροάστρις Zōroastris).

Etymology
The name Zoroaster (Ζωροάστηρ) is a Greek rendering of the Avestan name Zarathustra. He is known as Zartosht and Zardosht in Persian and Zaratosht in Gujarati. The Zoroastrian name of the religion is Mazdayasna, which combines Mazda- with the Avestan word yasna, meaning ""worship, devotion"". In English, an adherent of the faith is commonly called a Zoroastrian or a Zarathustrian. An older expression still used today is Behdin, meaning ""of the good religion"", deriving from beh < Middle Persian weh 'good' + din < Middle Persian dēn < Avestan daēnā"". In the Zoroastrian liturgy, this term is used as a title for a lay individual who has been formally inducted into the religion in a Navjote ceremony, in contrast to the priestly titles of osta, osti, ervad (hirbod), mobed and dastur.
The first surviving reference to Zoroaster in English scholarship is attributed to Thomas Browne (1605–1682), who briefly refers to Zoroaster in his 1643 Religio Medici. The term Mazdaism () is an alternative form in English used as well for the faith, taking Mazda- from the name Ahura Mazda and adding the suffix -ism to suggest a belief system.

Theology
The theological category of Zoroastrianism is hard to define. The reasons are the difficulties in assigning precise dates to the principle texts and the fact that many contain much older material. Furthermore, Zorastrianism shaped only slowly over time and was not complete even by the time of the Muslim conquest of Persia. Polytheistic, monotheistic, and dualistic strands can be identified in the wider Zorastrian tradition, with dualism being the dominant tendency. The major difference to Manichaeism lies in the insistence of good in the creation account.
Some scholars believe Zoroastrianism started as an Indo-Iranian polytheistic religion: according to Yujin Nagasawa, like the rest of the Zoroastrian texts, the Old Avesta does not teach monotheism. By contrast, Md. Sayem characterizes Zoroastrianism as being one of the oldest monotheistic religions in the world.
Zoroastrians treat Ahura Mazda as the supreme god, but believe in lesser divinities known as Yazatas, who share some similarities with the angels in Abrahamic religions. These yazatas (""good agents"") include Anahita, Sraosha, Mithra, Rashnu, and Tishtrya. Historian Richard Foltz has put forth evidence that Iranians of pre-Islamic era worshipped all these figures; especially the gods Mithra and Anahita. Prods Oktor Skjærvø states Zoroastrianism is henotheistic, and a dualistic and polytheistic religion, but with one supreme god, who is the father of the ordered cosmos.
Brian Arthur Brown states that this is unclear, because historic texts present a conflicting picture, ranging from Zoroastrianism's belief in one god, two gods, or a best god henotheism.
Economist Mario Ferrero suggests that Zoroastrianism transitioned from polytheism to monotheism due to political and economic pressures.
In the 19th century, through contact with Western academics and missionaries, Zoroastrianism experienced a massive theological change that still affects it today. The Rev. John Wilson led various missionary campaigns in India against the Parsi community, disparaging the Parsis for their ""dualism"" and ""polytheism"" and as having unnecessary rituals while declaring the Avesta to not be ""divinely inspired"". This caused mass dismay in the relatively uneducated Parsi community, which blamed its priests and led to some conversions towards Christianity.
The arrival of the German orientalist and philologist Martin Haug led to a rallied defense of the faith through Haug's reinterpretation of the Avesta through Christianized and European orientalist lens. Haug postulated that Zoroastrianism was solely monotheistic with all other divinities reduced to the status of angels while Ahura Mazda became both omnipotent and the source of evil as well as good. Haug's thinking was subsequently disseminated as a Parsi interpretation, thus corroborating Haug's theory, and the idea became so popular that it is now almost universally accepted as doctrine (though being re-evaluated in modern Zoroastrianism and academia). It has been argued by Almut Hintze that this designation of monotheism is not wholly perfect and that Zoroastrianism instead has its ""own form of monotheism"" which combines elements of dualism and polytheism. Farhang Mehr asserts that Zoroastrianism is principally monotheistic with some dualistic elements.
Lenorant and Chevallier assert that Zoroastrianism's concept of divinity covers both being and mind as immanent entities, describing Zoroastrianism as having a belief in an immanent self-creating universe with consciousness as its special attribute, thereby putting Zoroastrianism in the pantheistic fold sharing its origin with Indian Hinduism.

Nature of the divine
Zoroastrianism contains multiple classes of divine beings, who are typically organised into tiers and spheres of influence.

Ahuras
The Ahura are a class of divine beings inherited by Zoroastrianism from the prehistoric Indo-Iranian religion. In the Rig Veda, asura denotes the ""older gods"", such as the ""Father Asura"", Varuna, and Mitra, who originally ruled over the primeval undifferentiated Chaos.

Ahura Mazda
Ahura Mazda, also known as Oromasdes, Ohrmazd, Ormazd, Ormusd, Hoormazd, Harzoo, Hormazd, Hormaz and Hurmz, is the creator deity and the supreme god in Zoroastrianism. Ahura Mazda stands for the dual deity Mitrāˊ-Váruṇā of the Hindu holy book known as the Rigveda.
According to scholars, Ahura Mazda is an uncreated, omniscient, omnipotent and benevolent God who has created the spiritual and material existences out of infinite light, and maintains the cosmic law of Asha. He is the first and most invoked spirit in Yasna, and is unrivaled, has no equals and presides over all creation. In Avesta, Ahura Mazda is the only true God, and the representation of goodness, light, and truth. He is in conflict with the evil spirit Angra Mainyu, the representation of evil, darkness, and deceit. Angru Mainyu's goal is to tempt humans away from Ahura Mazda. Notably, Angra Mainyu is not a creation of Ahura Mazda but an independent entity. The belief in Ahura Mazda, the ""Lord of Wisdom"" who is considered an all-encompassing Deity and the only existing one, is the foundation of Zoroastrianism.

Ahura Mithra
Mitra, also called Mithra, was originally an Indo-Iranian god of covenant, agreement, treaty, alliance, promise. Mitra is considered a being worthy of worship and is ""characterized by riches"".

Yazata
The Yazata (Avestan: 𐬫𐬀𐬰𐬀𐬙𐬀) are divine beings worshiped by song and sacrifice in Zoroastrianism, in accordance with the Avesta. The word 'Yazata' is derived from 'Yazdan', the Old Persian word for 'god', and literally means ""divinity worthy of worship or veneration"". As a concept, it also contains a wide range of other meanings; though generally signifying (or used as an epithet of) a divinity.
The origins of Yazata are varied, with many also being featured as gods in Hinduism, or other Iranian religions. In modern Zoroastrianism, the Yazata are considered holy emanations of the creator, always devoted to him and obey the will of Ahura Mazda. While subject to repression by the Islamic Caliphate, the Yazata were often framed as ""angels"" to counter accusation of polytheism (shirk). According to the Avesta The Yazata assist Ahura Mazda in his battle against the evil spirit, and are hypostases of moral or physical aspects of creation. The yazatas collectively are the good powers under Ahura Mazda, who is the greatest of the yazatas.

Principal beliefs
Tenets of faith
In Zoroastrianism, Ahura Mazda is the beginning and the end, the creator of everything that can and cannot be seen, the eternal and uncreated, the all-good and source of Asha. In the Gathas, the most sacred texts of Zoroastrianism thought to have been composed by Zoroaster himself, Zoroaster acknowledged the highest devotion to Ahura Mazda, with worship and adoration also given to Ahura Mazda's manifestations (Amesha Spenta) and the other ahuras (Yazata) that support Ahura Mazda.
Daena (din in modern Persian and meaning ""that which is seen"") is representative of the sum of one's spiritual conscience and attributes, which through one's choice Asha is either strengthened or weakened in the Daena. Traditionally, the manthras (similar to the Hindu sacred utterance mantra) prayer formulas, are believed to be of immense power and the vehicles of Asha and creation used to maintain good and fight evil. Daena should not be confused with the fundamental principle of Asha, believed to be the cosmic order which governs and permeates all existence, and the concept of which governed the life of the ancient Indo-Iranians. For these, asha was the course of everything observable—the motion of the planets and astral bodies; the progression of the seasons; and the pattern of daily nomadic herdsman life, governed by regular metronomic events such as sunrise and sunset, and was strengthened through truth-telling and following the Threefold Path.
All physical creation (getig) was thus determined to run according to a master plan—inherent to Ahura Mazda—and violations of the order (druj) were violations against creation, and thus violations against Ahura Mazda. This concept of asha versus the druj should not be confused with Western and especially Christian notions of good versus evil, for although both forms of opposition express moral conflict, the asha versus druj concept is more systemic and less personal, representing, for instance, chaos (that opposes order); or ""uncreation"", evident as natural decay (that opposes creation); or more simply ""the lie"" (that opposes truth and goodness). Moreover, in the role as the one uncreated creator of all, Ahura Mazda is not the creator of druj, which is ""nothing"", anti-creation, and thus (likewise) uncreated and developed as the antithesis of existence through choice.

In this schema of asha versus druj, mortal beings (both humans and animals) play a critical role, for they too are created. Here, in their lives, they are active participants in the conflict, and it is their spiritual duty to defend Asha, which is under constant assault and would decay in strength without counteraction. Throughout the Gathas, Zoroaster emphasizes deeds and actions within society and accordingly extreme asceticism is frowned upon in Zoroastrianism but moderate forms are allowed within.
Humata, Huxta, Huvarshta (Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds), the Threefold Path of Asha, is considered the core maxim of Zoroastrianism especially by modern practitioners. In Zoroastrianism, good transpires for those who do righteous deeds for its own sake, not for the search of reward. Those who do evil are said to be attacked and confused by the druj and are responsible for aligning themselves back to Asha by following this path. There is also a heavy emphasis on spreading happiness, mostly through charity, and respecting the spiritual equality and duty of both men and women.
Central to Zoroastrianism is the emphasis on moral choice, to choose the responsibility and duty for which one is in the mortal world, or to give up this duty and so facilitate the work of druj. Similarly, predestination is rejected in Zoroastrian teaching and the absolute free will of all conscious beings is core, with even divine beings having the ability to choose. Humans bear responsibility for all situations they are in, and in the way they act toward one another. Reward, punishment, happiness, and grief all depend on how individuals live their lives.
In Zoroastrian tradition, life is a temporary state in which a mortal is expected to participate actively in the continuing battle between Asha and Druj. Prior to its incarnation at the birth of the child, the urvan (soul) of an individual is still united with its fravashi (personal/higher spirit), which has existed since Ahura Mazda created the universe. Prior to the splitting off of the urvan, the fravashi participates in the maintenance of creation led by Ahura Mazda. During the life of a given individual, the fravashi acts as a source of inspiration to perform good actions and as a spiritual protector. The fravashis of ancestors cultural, spiritual, and heroic, associated with illustrious bloodlines, are venerated and can be called upon to aid the living.
The religion states that active and ethical participation in life through good deeds formed from good thoughts and good words is necessary to ensure happiness and to keep chaos at bay. This active participation is a central element in Zoroaster's concept of free will, and Zoroastrianism as such rejects extreme forms of asceticism and monasticism but historically has allowed for moderate expressions of these concepts. On the fourth day after death, the urvan is reunited with its fravashi, whereupon the experiences of life in the material world are collected for use in the continuing battle for good in the spiritual world. For the most part, Zoroastrianism does not have a notion of reincarnation; albeit Followers of Ilm-e-Kshnoom in India, among other currently non-traditional opinions, believe in reincarnation and practice vegetarianism.
Zoroastrianism's emphasis on the protection and veneration of nature and its elements has led some to proclaim it as the world's first proponent of ecology. The Avesta and other texts call for the protection of water, earth, fire, and air making it, in effect, an ecological religion: It is not surprising that Mazdaism... is called the first ecological religion. The reverence for Yazatas (divine spirits) emphasizes the preservation of nature (Avesta: Yasnas 1.19, 3.4, 16.9; Yashts 6.3–4, 10.13). However, this particular assertion is limited to natural forces held as emanations of asha by the fact that early Zoroastrians had a duty to exterminate ""evil"" species, a dictate no longer followed in modern Zoroastrianism. Although there have been various theological statements supporting vegetarianism in Zoroastrianism's history and those who believe that Zoroaster was vegetarian.
Zoroastrianism is not entirely uniform in theological and philosophical thought, especially with historical and modern influences having a significant impact on individual and local beliefs, practices, values, and vocabulary, sometimes merging with tradition and in other cases displacing it. The ultimate purpose in the life of a practicing Zoroastrian is to become an ashavan (a master of Asha) and to bring happiness into the world, which contributes to the cosmic battle against evil. The core teachings of Zoroastrianism include:

Following the threefold path of Asha: Humata, Hūxta, Huvarshta (lit. 'good thoughts, good words, good deeds').
Practicing charity to keep one's soul aligned with Asha and thus with spreading happiness.
The spiritual equality and duty of men and women alike.
Being good for the sake of goodness and without the hope of reward (see Ashem Vohu).

Cosmology
Cosmogony
According to the Zoroastrian creation myth, there is one universal, transcendent, all-good, and uncreated supreme creator deity Ahura Mazda, or the ""Wise Lord"" (Ahura meaning ""Lord"" and Mazda meaning ""Wisdom"" in Avestan). Zoroaster keeps the two attributes separate as two different concepts in most of the Gathas yet sometimes combines them into one form. Zoroaster also proclaims that Ahura Mazda is omniscient but not omnipotent. Ahura Mazda existed in light and goodness above, while Angra Mainyu, (also referred to in later texts as ""Ahriman""), the destructive spirit/mentality,
existed in darkness and ignorance below. They have existed independently of each other for all time, and manifest contrary substances. In the Gathas, Ahura Mazda is noted as working through emanations known as the Amesha Spenta and with the help of ""other ahuras"". These divine beings called Amesha Spentas, support him and are representative and guardians of different aspects of creation and the ideal personality. Ahura Mazda is immanent in humankind and interacts with creation through these bounteous/holy divinities. In addition to these, He is assisted by a league of countless divinities called Yazatas, meaning ""worthy of worship."" Each Yazata is generally a hypostasis of a moral or physical aspect of creation. Asha, is the main spiritual force which comes from Ahura Mazda. It is the cosmic order and is the antithesis of chaos, which is evident as druj, falsehood and disorder, that comes from Angra Mainyu. The resulting cosmic conflict involves all of creation, mental/spiritual and material, including humanity at its core, which has an active role to play in the conflict. The main representative of Asha in this conflict is Spenta Mainyu, the creative spirit/mentality. Ahura Mazda then created the material and visible world itself in order to ensnare evil. He created the floating, egg-shaped universe in two parts: first the spiritual (menog) and 3,000 years later, the physical (getig). Ahura Mazda then created Gayomard, the archetypical perfect man, and Gavaevodata, the primordial bovine.
While Ahura Mazda created the universe and humankind, Angra Mainyu, whose very nature is to destroy, miscreated demons, evil daevas, and noxious creatures (khrafstar) such as snakes, ants, and flies. Angra Mainyu created an opposite, evil being for each good being, except for humans, which he found he could not match. Angra Mainyu invaded the universe through the base of the sky, inflicting Gayomard and the bull with suffering and death. However, the evil forces were trapped in the universe and could not retreat. The dying primordial man and bovine emitted seeds, which were protect by Mah, the Moon. From the bull's seed grew all beneficial plants and animals of the world and from the man's seed grew a plant whose leaves became the first human couple. Humans thus struggle in a two-fold universe of the material and spiritual trapped and in long combat with evil. The evils of this physical world are not products of an inherent weakness but are the fault of Angra Mainyu's assault on creation. This assault turned the perfectly flat, peaceful, and daily illuminated world into a mountainous, violent place that is half night. According to Zoroastrian cosmology, in articulating the Ahuna Vairya formula, Ahura Mazda made the ultimate triumph of good against Angra Mainyu evident. Ahura Mazda will ultimately prevail over the evil Angra Mainyu, at which point reality will undergo a cosmic renovation called Frashokereti and limited time will end. In the final renovation, all of creation—even the souls of the dead that were initially banished to or chose to descend into ""darkness""—will be reunited with Ahura Mazda in the Kshatra Vairya (meaning ""best dominion""), being resurrected to immortality.

Cosmography
Zoroastrian cosmography, which refers to the description of the structure of the cosmos in Zoroastrian literature and theology, involves a primary division of the cosmos into heaven and earth. The heaven is composed of three parts: the lower-most part, which is where the fixed stars may be found; the middle part, where the domain of the moon is located, and the upper part, which is the domain of the sun and unreachable by Ahirman. Further above the highest level of the heaven/sky includes regions described as the Endless Lights, as well as the Thrones of Amahraspandān and Ohrmazd. Although this is the basic framework which occurs in Avestan texts, later Zoroastrian literature would elaborate on this picture by further subdividing the lowest part of heaven to achieve a total of six or seven layers. The Earth itself was described as possessing three primary mountains: Mount Hukairiia, whose peak was the focal point of the revolution of the star Sadwēs; Mount Haraitī, whose peak was the focal point of the revolution of the sun and the moon, and the greatest of them all, the Harā Bərəz whose peak was located at the center of the Earth and which was the first in a chain of 2,244 mountains which, together, encircled the Earth. Although the planets are not described in early Zoroastrian sources, they entered Zoroastrian thought in the Middle Persian period: they were demonized and took on the names Anāhīd (Pahlavi for Venus), Tīr (Mercury), Wahrām (Mars), Ohrmazd (Jupiter), and Kēwān (Saturn).

Eschatology
Individual judgment at death is at the Chinvat Bridge (""bridge of judgement"" or ""bridge of choice""), which each human must cross, facing a spiritual judgment, though modern belief is split as to whether it is representative of a mental decision during life to choose between good and evil or an afterworld location. Humans' actions under their free will through choice determine the outcome. According to tradition, the soul is judged by the Yazatas Mithra, Sraosha, and Rashnu, where depending on the verdict one is either greeted at the bridge by a beautiful, sweet-smelling maiden or by an ugly, foul-smelling old hag representing their Daena affected by their actions in life. The maiden leads the dead safely across the bridge, which widens and becomes pleasant for the righteous, towards the House of Song. The hag leads the dead down a bridge that narrows to a razor's edge and is full of stench until the departed falls off into the abyss towards the House of Lies. Those with a balance of good and evil go to Hamistagan, a purgatorial realm mentioned in the 9th century work Dadestan-i Denig.
The House of Lies is considered temporary and reformative; punishments fit the crimes, and souls do not rest in eternal damnation. Hell contains foul smells and evil food, a smothering darkness, and souls are packed tightly together although they believe they are in total isolation.
In ancient Zoroastrian eschatology, a 3,000-year struggle between good and evil will be fought, punctuated by evil's final assault. During the final assault, the sun and moon will darken, and humankind will lose its reverence for religion, family, and elders. The world will fall into winter, and Angra Mainyu's most fearsome miscreant, Azi Dahaka, will break free and terrorize the world.
According to legend, the final savior of the world, known as the Saoshyant, will be born to a virgin impregnated by the seed of Zoroaster while bathing in a lake. The Saoshyant will raise the dead—including those in all afterworlds—for final judgment, returning the wicked to hell to be purged of bodily sin. Next, all will wade through a river of molten metal in which the righteous will not burn but through which the impure will be completely purified. The forces of good will ultimately triumph over evil, rendering it forever impotent but not destroyed. The Saoshyant and Ahura Mazda will offer a bull as a final sacrifice for all time and all humans will become immortal. Mountains will again flatten and valleys will rise; the House of Song will descend to the moon, and the earth will rise to meet them both. Humanity will require two judgments because there are as many aspects to our being: spiritual (menog) and physical (getig).

Practices and rituals
Throughout Zoroastrian history, shrines and temples have been the focus of worship and pilgrimage for adherents of the religion. Early Zoroastrians were recorded as worshiping in the 5th century BCE on mounds and hills where fires were lit below the open skies. In the wake of Achaemenid expansion, shrines were constructed throughout the empire and particularly influenced the role of Mithra, Aredvi Sura Anahita, Verethragna and Tishtrya, alongside other traditional Yazata who all have hymns within the Avesta and also local deities and culture-heroes. Today, enclosed and covered fire temples tend to be the focus of community worship where fires of varying grades are maintained by the clergy assigned to the temples.
The incorporation of cultural and local rituals is quite common and traditions have been passed down in historically Zoroastrian communities such as herbal healing practices, wedding ceremonies, and the like. Traditionally, Zoroastrian rituals have also included shamanic elements involving mystical methods such as spirit travel to the invisible realm and involving the consumption of fortified wine, Haoma, mang, and other ritual aids.

In Zoroastrianism, water (aban) and fire (atar) are agents of ritual purity, and the associated purification ceremonies are considered the basis of ritual life. In Zoroastrian cosmogony, water and fire are respectively the second and last primordial elements to have been created, and scripture considers fire to have its origin in the waters (re. which conception see Apam Napat).
A corpse is considered a host for decay, i.e., of druj. Consequently, scripture enjoins the safe disposal of the dead in a manner such that a corpse does not pollute the good creation. These injunctions are the doctrinal basis of the fast-fading traditional practice of ritual exposure, most commonly identified with the so-called Towers of Silence for which there is no standard technical term in either scripture or tradition. Ritual exposure is currently mainly practiced by Zoroastrian communities of the Indian subcontinent, in locations where it is not illegal and diclofenac poisoning has not led to the virtual extinction of scavenger birds.
The central ritual of Zoroastrianism is the Yasna, which is a recitation of the eponymous book of the Avesta and sacrificial ritual ceremony involving Haoma. Extensions to the Yasna ritual are possible through use of the Visperad and Vendidad, but such an extended ritual is rare in modern Zoroastrianism. The Yasna itself descended from Indo-Iranian sacrificial ceremonies and animal sacrifice of varying degrees are mentioned in the Avesta and are still practiced in Zoroastrianism albeit through reduced forms such as the sacrifice of fat before meals. High rituals such as the Yasna are considered to be the purview of the Mobads with a corpus of individual and communal rituals and prayers included in the Khordeh Avesta.
A Zoroastrian is welcomed into the faith through the Navjote/Sedreh Pushi ceremony, which is traditionally conducted during the later childhood or pre-teen years of the aspirant, though there is no defined age limit for the ritual. After the ceremony, Zoroastrians are encouraged to wear their sedreh (ritual shirt) and kushti (ritual girdle) daily as a spiritual reminder and for mystical protection, though reformist Zoroastrians tend to only wear them during festivals, ceremonies, and prayers.
Historically, Zoroastrians are encouraged to pray the five daily Gāhs and to maintain and celebrate the various holy festivals of the Zoroastrian calendar, which can differ from community to community. Zoroastrian prayers, called manthras, are conducted usually with hands outstretched in imitation of Zoroaster's prayer style described in the Gathas and are of a reflectionary and supplicant nature believed to be endowed with the ability to banish evil. Devout Zoroastrians are known to cover their heads during prayer, either with traditional topi, scarves, other headwear, or even just their hands. However, full coverage and veiling which is traditional in Islamic practice is not a part of Zoroastrianism and Zoroastrian women in Iran wear their head coverings displaying hair and their faces to defy mandates by the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Scripture
Avesta
The Avesta is a collection of the central religious texts of Zoroastrianism written in the old Iranian dialect of Avestan. The history of the Avesta is speculated upon in many Pahlavi texts with varying degrees of authority, with the current version of the Avesta dating at oldest from the times of the Sasanian Empire. The Avesta was composed at different times, providing a series of snapshots of the religion that allow historians to see how it changed over time. According to Middle Persian tradition, Ahura Mazda created the twenty-one Nasks of the original Avesta which Zoroaster brought to Vishtaspa. Here, two copies were created, one which was put in the house of archives and the other put in the Imperial treasury. During Alexander's conquest of Persia, the Avesta (written on 1200 ox-hides) was burned, and the scientific sections that the Greeks could use were dispersed among themselves. However, there is no strong historical evidence for this and they remain contested despite affirmations from the Zoroastrian tradition, whether it be the Denkart, Tansar-nāma, Ardāy Wirāz Nāmag, Bundahsin, Zand-i Wahman yasn or the transmitted oral tradition.
As tradition continues, under the reign of King Valax (identified with a Vologases of the Arsacid dynasty), an attempt was made to restore what was considered the Avesta. During the Sassanid Empire, Ardeshir ordered Tansar, his high priest, to finish the work that King Valax had started. Shapur I sent priests to locate the scientific text portions of the Avesta that were in the possession of the Greeks. Under Shapur II, Arderbad Mahrespandand revised the canon to ensure its orthodox character, while under Khosrow I, the Avesta was translated into Pahlavi.
The compilation of the Avesta can be authoritatively traced, however, to the Sasanian Empire, of which only fraction survive today if the Middle Persian literature is correct. The later manuscripts all date from after the fall of the Sasanian Empire, the latest being from 1288, 590 years after the fall of the Sasanian Empire. The texts that remain today are the Gathas, Yasna, Visperad and the Vendidad, of which the latter's inclusion is disputed within the faith. Along with these texts is the individual, communal, and ceremonial prayer book called the Khordeh Avesta, which contains the Yashts and other important hymns, prayers, and rituals. The rest of the materials from the Avesta are called ""Avestan fragments"" in that they are written in Avestan, incomplete, and generally of unknown provenance.

Middle Persian (Pahlavi)
Middle Persian and Pahlavi works created in the 9th and 10th century contain many religious Zoroastrian books, as most of the writers and copyists were part of the Zoroastrian clergy. The most significant and important books of this era include the Denkard, Bundahishn, Menog-i Khrad, Selections of Zadspram, Jamasp Namag, Epistles of Manucher, Rivayats, Dadestan-i-Denig, and Arda Viraf Namag. All Middle Persian texts written on Zoroastrianism during this time period are considered secondary works on the religion, and not scripture.

History
Zoroaster
Zoroastrianism was founded by Zoroaster in ancient Iran. The precise date of the founding of the religion is uncertain and estimates vary wildly from 2000 BCE to 200 years before Alexander. Zoroaster was born – in either Northeast Iran or Southwest Afghanistan – into a culture with a polytheistic religion, which featured excessive animal sacrifice and the excessive ritual use of intoxicants. His life was influenced profoundly by the attempts of his people to find peace and stability in the face of constant threats of raiding and conflict. Zoroaster's birth and early life are little documented but speculated upon heavily in later texts. What is known is recorded in the Gathas, forming the core of the Avesta, which contain hymns thought to have been composed by Zoroaster himself. Born into the Spitama clan, he refers to himself as a poet-priest and prophet. He had a wife, three sons, and three daughters, the numbers of which are gathered from various texts.
Zoroaster rejected many of the gods of the Bronze Age Iranians and their oppressive class structure, in which the Kavis and Karapans (princes and priests) controlled the ordinary people. He also opposed cruel animal sacrifices and the excessive use of the possibly hallucinogenic Haoma plant (conjectured to have been a species of ephedra or Peganum harmala), but did not condemn either practice outright, providing moderation was observed.

Legendary accounts
According to later Zoroastrian tradition, when Zoroaster was 30 years old, he went into the Daiti river to draw water for a Haoma ceremony; when he emerged, he received a vision of Vohu Manah. After this, Vohu Manah took him to the other six Amesha Spentas, where he received the completion of his vision. This vision radically transformed his view of the world, and he tried to teach this view to others. Zoroaster believed in one supreme creator deity and acknowledged this creator's emanations (Amesha Spenta) and other divinities which he called Ahuras (Yazata). Some of the deities of the old religion, the Daevas (etymologically similar to the Sanskrit Devas), appeared to delight in war and strife and were condemned as evil workers of Angra Mainyu by Zoroaster.
Zoroaster's ideas were not taken up quickly; he originally only had one convert: his cousin Maidhyoimanha.

Cypress of Kashmar
The Cypress of Kashmar is a mythical cypress tree of legendary beauty and gargantuan dimensions. It is said to have sprung from a branch brought by Zoroaster from Paradise and to have stood in today's Kashmar in northeastern Iran and to have been planted by Zoroaster in honor of the conversion of King Vishtaspa to Zoroastrianism. According to the Iranian physicist and historian Zakariya al-Qazwini King Vishtaspa had been a patron of Zoroaster who planted the tree himself. In his ʿAjā'ib al-makhlūqāt wa gharā'ib al-mawjūdāt, he further describes how the Abbasid caliph Al-Mutawakkil in 247 AH (861 CE) caused the mighty cypress to be felled, and then transported it across Iran, to be used for beams in his new palace at Samarra. Before, he wanted the tree to be reconstructed before his eyes. This was done in spite of protests by the Iranians, who offered a very great sum of money to save the tree. Al-Mutawakkil never saw the cypress, because he was murdered by a Turkish soldier (possibly in the employ of his son) on the night when it arrived on the banks of the Tigris.

Fire Temple of Kashmar
Kashmar Fire Temple was the first Zoroastrian fire temple built by Vishtaspa at the request of Zoroaster in Kashmar. In a part of Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, the story of finding Zarathustra and accepting Vishtaspa's religion is regulated that after accepting Zoroastrian religion, Vishtaspa sends priests all over the universe And Azar enters the fire temples (domes) and the first of them is Adur Burzen-Mihr who founded in Kashmar and planted a cypress tree in front of the fire temple and made it a symbol of accepting the Bahi religion And he sent priests all over the world, and commanded all the famous men and women to come to that place of worship.
According to the Paikuli inscription, during the Sasanian Empire, Kashmar was part of Greater Khorasan, and the Sasanians worked hard to revive the ancient religion. It still remains a few kilometers above the ancient city of Kashmar in the castle complex of Atashgah.

Early history
The roots of Zoroastrianism are thought to lie in a common prehistoric Indo-Iranian religious system dating back to the early 2nd millennium BCE. The prophet Zoroaster himself, though traditionally dated to the 6th century BCE, is thought by many modern historians to have been a reformer of the polytheistic Iranian religion who lived much earlier during the second half of the second millennium BCE. Zoroastrian tradition names Airyanem Vaejah as the home of Zarathustra and the birthplace of the religion. No consensus exists as to the localization of Airyanem Vaejah, but the region of Khwarezm has been considered by modern scholars as a candidate. Zoroastrianism as a religion was not firmly established until centuries later during the Young Avestan period. At this time, the Zoroastrian community was concentrated in the eastern portion of Greater Iran. Although no consensus exists on the chronology of the Avestan period, the lack of any discernable Persian and Median influence in the Avesta makes a time frame in the first half of the first millennium BCE likely.

Classical antiquity
Zoroastrianism enters recorded history in the mid-5th century BCE. Herodotus' The Histories (completed c. 440 BCE) includes a description of Greater Iranian society with what may be recognizably Zoroastrian features, including exposure of the dead.
The Histories is a primary source of information on the early period of the Achaemenid era (648–330 BCE), in particular with respect to the role of the Magi. According to Herodotus, the Magi were the sixth tribe of the Medes (until the unification of the Persian empire under Cyrus the Great, all Iranians were referred to as ""Mede"" or ""Mada"" by the peoples of the Ancient World) and wielded considerable influence at the courts of the Median emperors.
Following the unification of the Median and Persian empires in 550 BCE, Cyrus the Great and later his son Cambyses II curtailed the powers of the Magi after they had attempted to sow dissent following their loss of influence. In 522 BCE, the Magi revolted and set up a rival claimant to the throne. The usurper, pretending to be Cyrus' younger son Smerdis, took power shortly thereafter. Owing to the despotic rule of Cambyses and his long absence in Egypt, the whole people, Persians, Medes and all the other nations acknowledged the usurper, especially as he granted a remission of taxes for three years.
Darius I and later Achaemenid emperors acknowledged their devotion to Ahura Mazda in inscriptions, as attested to several times in the Behistun inscription and appear to have continued the model of coexistence with other religions. Whether Darius was a follower of the teachings of Zoroaster has not been conclusively established as there is no indication of note that worship of Ahura Mazda was exclusively a Zoroastrian practice.
According to later Zoroastrian legend (Denkard and the Book of Arda Viraf), many sacred texts were lost when Alexander the Great's troops invaded Persepolis and subsequently destroyed the royal library there. Diodorus Siculus's Bibliotheca historica, which was completed c. 60 BCE, appears to substantiate this Zoroastrian legend. According to one archaeological examination, the ruins of the palace of Xerxes I bear traces of having been burned. Whether a vast collection of (semi-)religious texts written on parchment in gold ink, as suggested by the Denkard, actually existed remains a matter of speculation.
Alexander's conquests largely displaced Zoroastrianism with Hellenistic beliefs, though the religion continued to be practiced many centuries following the demise of the Achaemenids in mainland Persia and the core regions of the former Achaemenid Empire, most notably Anatolia, Mesopotamia, and the Caucasus. In the Cappadocian kingdom, whose territory was formerly an Achaemenid possession, Persian colonists, cut off from their co-religionists in Iran proper, continued to practice the faith [Zoroastrianism] of their forefathers; and there Strabo, observing in the first century BCE, records (XV.3.15) that these ""fire kindlers"" possessed many holy places of the Persian Gods, as well as fire temples. Strabo further states that these were noteworthy enclosures; and in their midst there is an altar, on which there is a large quantity of ashes and where the magi keep the fire ever burning. It was not until the end of the Parthian Empire (247 BCE – 224 CE) that Zoroastrianism would receive renewed interest.

Late antiquity
As late as the Parthian period, a form of Zoroastrianism was without a doubt the dominant religion in the Armenian lands. The Sassanids aggressively promoted the Zurvanite form of Zoroastrianism, often building fire temples in captured territories to promote the religion. During the period of their centuries-long suzerainty over the Caucasus, the Sassanids made attempts to promote Zoroastrianism there with considerable successes.
Due to its ties to the Christian Roman Empire, Persia's archrival since Parthian times, the Sassanids were suspicious of Roman Christianity, and after the reign of Constantine the Great, sometimes persecuted it. In 451 CE, the Sassanid authority clashed with their Armenian subjects in the Battle of Avarayr, making them officially break with the Roman Church. But the Sassanids tolerated or even sometimes favored the Christianity of the Church of the East. The acceptance of Christianity in Georgia (Caucasian Iberia) saw the Zoroastrian religion there slowly but surely decline, but as late the 5th century CE, it was still widely practised as something like a second established religion.

Decline in the Middle Ages
Over the course of 16 years during the 7th century, most of the Sasanian Empire was conquered by the emerging Muslim caliphate. Although the administration of the state was rapidly Islamicized and subsumed under the Umayyad Caliphate, in the beginning there was little serious pressure exerted on newly subjected people to adopt Islam. Because of their sheer numbers, the conquered Zoroastrians had to be treated as dhimmis (despite doubts of the validity of this identification that persisted down the centuries), which made them eligible for protection. Islamic jurists took the stance that only Muslims could be perfectly moral, but unbelievers might as well be left to their iniquities, so long as these did not vex their overlords. In the main, once the conquest was over and local terms were agreed on, the Arab governors protected the local populations in exchange for tribute.
The Arabs adopted the Sasanian tax-system, both the land-tax levied on landowners and the poll-tax levied on individuals, called jizya, a tax levied on non-Muslims (i.e., the dhimmis). In time, this poll-tax came to be used as a means to humble the non-Muslims, and a number of laws and restrictions evolved to emphasize their inferior status. Under the early orthodox caliphs, as long as the non-Muslims paid their taxes and adhered to the dhimmi laws, administrators were enjoined to leave non-Muslims in their religion and their land.
Under Abbasid rule, Muslim Iranians (who by then were in the majority) in many instances showed severe disregard for and mistreated local Zoroastrians. For example, in the 9th century, a deeply venerated cypress tree in Khorasan (which Parthian-era legend supposed had been planted by Zoroaster himself) was felled for the construction of a palace in Baghdad, 2,000 miles (3,200 km) away. In the 10th century, on the day that a Tower of Silence had been completed at much trouble and expense, a Muslim official contrived to get up onto it, and to call the adhan (the Muslim call to prayer) from its walls. This was turned into a pretext to annex the building.
Ultimately, Muslim scholars like Al-Biruni found few records left of the belief of for instance the Khawarizmians because figures like Qutayba ibn Muslim extinguished and ruined in every possible way all those who knew how to write and read the Khawarizmi writing, who knew the history of the country and who studied their sciences. As a result, these things are involved in so much obscurity that it is impossible to obtain an accurate knowledge of the history of the country since the time of Islam...

Conversion
Though subject to a new leadership and harassment, the Zoroastrians were able to continue their former ways, although there was a slow but steady social and economic pressure to convert, with the nobility and city-dwellers being the first to do so, while Islam was accepted more slowly among the peasantry and landed gentry. Power and worldly-advantage now lay with followers of Islam, and although the official policy was one of aloof contempt, there were individual Muslims eager to proselytize and ready to use all sorts of means to do so.
In time, a tradition evolved by which Islam was made to appear as a partly Iranian religion. One example of this was a legend that Husayn, son of the fourth caliph Ali and grandson of Islam's prophet Muhammad, had married a captive Sassanid princess named Shahrbanu. This ""wholly fictitious figure"" was said to have borne Husayn a son, the historical fourth Shi'a imam, who insisted that the caliphate rightly belonged to him and his descendants, and that the Umayyads had wrongfully wrested it from him. The alleged descent from the Sassanid house counterbalanced the Arab nationalism of the Umayyads, and the Iranian national association with a Zoroastrian past was disarmed. Thus, according to scholar Mary Boyce, it was no longer the Zoroastrians alone who stood for patriotism and loyalty to the past. The ""damning indictment"" that becoming Muslim was un-Iranian only remained an idiom in Zoroastrian texts.
With Iranian support, the Abbasids overthrew the Umayyads in 750, and in the subsequent caliphate government—that nominally lasted until 1258—Muslim Iranians received marked favor in the new government, both in Iran and at the capital in Baghdad. This mitigated the antagonism between Arabs and Iranians but sharpened the distinction between Muslims and non-Muslims. The Abbasids zealously persecuted heretics, and although this was directed mainly at Muslim sectarians, it also created a harsher climate for non-Muslims.

Survival
Despite economic and social incentives to convert, Zoroastrianism remained strong in some regions, particularly in those furthest away from the Caliphate capital at Baghdad. In Bukhara (present-day Uzbekistan), resistance to Islam required the 9th-century Arab commander Qutaiba to convert his province four times. The first three times the citizens reverted to their old religion. Finally, the governor made their religion difficult for them in every way, turned the local fire temple into a mosque, and encouraged the local population to attend Friday prayers by paying each attendee two dirhams. The cities where Arab governors resided were particularly vulnerable to such pressures, and in these cases the Zoroastrians were left with no choice but to either conform or migrate to regions that had a more amicable administration.
The 9th century came to define the great number of Zoroastrian texts that were composed or re-written during the 8th to 10th centuries (excluding copying and lesser amendments, which continued for some time thereafter). All of these works are in the Middle Persian dialect of that period (free of Arabic words) and written in the difficult Pahlavi script (hence the adoption of the term ""Pahlavi"" as the name of the variant of the language, and of the genre, of those Zoroastrian books). If read aloud, these books would still have been intelligible to the laity. Many of these texts are responses to the tribulations of the time, and all of them include exhortations to stand fast in their religious beliefs.

In Khorasan in northeastern Iran, a 10th-century Iranian nobleman brought together four Zoroastrian priests to transcribe a Sassanid-era Middle Persian work titled Book of the Lord (Khwaday Namag) from Pahlavi script into Arabic script. This transcription, which remained in Middle Persian prose (an Arabic version, by al-Muqaffa, also exists), was completed in 957 and subsequently became the basis for Firdausi's Book of Kings. It became enormously popular among both Zoroastrians and Muslims, and also served to propagate the Sassanid justification for overthrowing the Arsacids.
Among migrations were those to cities in (or on the margins of) the great salt deserts, in particular to Yazd and Kerman, which remain centers of Iranian Zoroastrianism to this day. Yazd became the seat of the Iranian high priests during Mongol Ilkhanate rule, when the best hope for survival [for a non-Muslim] was to be inconspicuous. Crucial to the present-day survival of Zoroastrianism was a migration from the northeastern Iranian town of ""Sanjan in south-western Khorasan"", to Gujarat, in western India. The descendants of that group are today known as the Parsis—""as the Gujaratis, from long tradition, called anyone from Iran""—who today represent the larger of the two groups of Zoroastrians in India.

The struggle between Zoroastrianism and Islam declined in the 10th and 11th centuries. Local Iranian dynasties, ""all vigorously Muslim,"" had emerged as largely independent vassals of the Caliphs. In the 16th century, in one of the early letters between Iranian Zoroastrians and their co-religionists in India, the priests of Yazd lamented that ""no period [in human history], not even that of Alexander, had been more grievous or troublesome for the faithful than 'this millennium of the demon ofWrath'.""

Modern
Zoroastrianism has survived into the modern period, particularly in India, where the Parsis are thought to have been present since about the 9th century.
Today Zoroastrianism can be divided in two main schools of thought: reformists and traditionalists. Traditionalists are mostly Parsis and accept, beside the Gathas and Avesta, also the Middle Persian literature and like the reformists mostly developed in their modern form from 19th century developments. They generally do not allow conversion to the faith and, as such, for someone to be a Zoroastrian they must be born of Zoroastrian parents. Some traditionalists recognize the children of mixed marriages as Zoroastrians, though usually only if the father is a born Zoroastrian. Not all Zoroastrians identify with either school. Notable examples gaining traction include Neo-Zoroastrians/Revivalists, which are usually reinterpretations of Zoroastrianism appealing towards Western concerns, and centering the idea of Zoroastrianism as a living religion. These advocate the revival and maintenance of old rituals and prayers while supporting ethical and social progressive reforms. Both of these latter schools tend to center the Gathas without outright rejecting other texts except the Vendidad.
From the 19th century onward, the Parsis gained a reputation for their education and widespread influence in all aspects of society. They played an instrumental role in the economic development of the region over many decades; several of the best-known business conglomerates of India are run by Parsi-Zoroastrians, including the Tata, Godrej, Wadia families, and others.
For a variety of social and political factors, the Zoroastrians of the Indian subcontinent, namely the Parsis and Iranis, have not engaged in conversion since at least the 18th century. Zoroastrian high priests have historically opined there is no reason to not allow conversion, which is also supported by the Revayats and other scripture, though later priests have condemned these judgements. Within Iran, many of the beleaguered Zoroastrians have been also historically opposed or not practically concerned with the matter of conversion. Currently though, The Council of Tehran Mobeds (the highest ecclesiastical authority within Iran) endorses conversion but conversion from Islam to Zoroastrianism is illegal under the laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Though the Armenians share a rich history affiliated with Zoroastrianism (that eventually declined with the advent of Christianity), reports indicate that there were Zoroastrians in Armenia until the 1920s.
At the request of the government of Tajikistan, UNESCO declared 2003 a year to celebrate the ""3000th anniversary of Zoroastrian culture"", with special events throughout the world. In 2011, the Tehran Mobeds Anjuman announced that for the first time in the history of modern Iran and of the modern Zoroastrian communities worldwide, women had been ordained in Iran and North America as mobedyars, meaning women assistant mobeds (Zoroastrian clergy). The women hold official certificates and can perform the lower-rung religious functions and can initiate people into the religion.
The current Zoroastrian population is said be around 100,000 to 200,000 and reportedly declining. However, further studies are needed to confirm this, as numbers have also been rising in some areas, such as Iran.

Demographics
Zoroastrian communities internationally tend to comprise mostly two main groups of people: Indian Parsis and Iranian Zoroastrians.According to a study in 2012 by the Federation of Zoroastrian Associations of North America, the number of Zoroastrians worldwide was estimated to be between 111,691 and 121,962. The number is imprecise because of diverging counts in Iran.

Iran and Central Asia
Iran's figures of Zoroastrians have ranged widely; the last census (1974) before the revolution of 1979 revealed 21,400 Zoroastrians. Some 10,000 adherents remain in the Central Asian regions that were once considered the traditional stronghold of Zoroastrianism, i.e., Bactria (see also Balkh), which is in Northern Afghanistan; Sogdiana; Margiana; and other areas close to Zoroaster's homeland. In Iran, emigration, out-marriage and low birth rates are likewise leading to a decline in the Zoroastrian population. Zoroastrian groups in Iran say their number is approximately 60,000. According to the Iranian census data from 2011 the number of Zoroastrians in Iran was 25,271.
Communities exist in Tehran, as well as in Yazd, Kerman and Kermanshah, where many still speak an Iranian language distinct from the usual Persian. They call their language Dari, not to be confused with the Dari spoken in Afghanistan. Their language is also called Gavri or Behdini, literally ""of the Good Religion"". Sometimes their language is named for the cities in which it is spoken, such as Yazdi or Kermani. Iranian Zoroastrians were historically called Gabrs.
The number of Kurdish Zoroastrians, along with those of non-ethnic converts, has been estimated differently. The Zoroastrian Representative of the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq has reported that as many as 100,000 people in Iraqi Kurdistan have converted to Zoroastrianism recently, with some community leaders speculating that even more Zoroastrians in the region are practicing their faith secretly. However, this has not been confirmed by independent sources.
The surge in Kurdish Muslims converting to Zoroastrianism is largely attributed to disillusionment with Islam after experiencing violence and oppression perpetrated by ISIS in the area.

South Asia
India is considered to be home to a large Zoroastrian population – the descendants of migrants from Iran and today known as the Parsis. In India's 2001 census, the Parsi population numbered at 69,601, representing about 0.006% of the total population of India, with a concentration in and around the city of Mumbai. By 2008, the birth-to-death ratio was 1:5; 200 births per year to 1,000 deaths. India's 2011 census recorded 57,264 Parsi Zoroastrians.
The Zoroastrian population in Pakistan was estimated to number 1,675 people in 2012, mostly living in Sindh (especially Karachi) followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) of Pakistan reported that there were 3,650 Parsi voters during the elections in Pakistan in 2013 and 4,235 in 2018. According to the 2023 Pakistani census, there were 2,348 Parsis across the nation, with 1,656 (70.5%) being located in the Karachi Division.

Western world
North America is thought to be home to 18,000–25,000 Zoroastrians of both South Asian and Iranian backgrounds. As of 2012, the population of Zoroastrians in US was 15,000, making it the third-largest Zoroastrian population in the world after those of India and Iran. According to the 2021 Canadian census, the Zoroastrian Canadian population stood at 7,285, of which 3,630 were Parsis (of South Asian descent) and a further 2,390 of West Asian origin. A further 3,500 live in Australia (mainly in Sydney). Stewart, Hinze & Williams write that 3,000 Kurds have converted to Zoroastrianism in Sweden. According to the 2021 UK census, there were 4,105 Zoroastrians in England and Wales, of which 4,043 were in England. The majority (51%) of these (2,050) were in London, most notably the boroughs of Barnet, Harrow and Westminster. The remaining 49% of English Zoroastrians were scattered relatively evenly throughout the country, with the second and third largest concentrations being Birmingham (72) and Manchester (47). In 2020, Historic England published A Survey of Zoroastrianism Buildings in England with the aim of providing information about buildings that Zoroastrians use in England so that HE can work with communities to enhance and protect those buildings now and in the future. The scoping survey identified four buildings in England.

Relation to other religions and cultures
Indo-Iranian origins
The religion of Zoroastrianism is closest to historical Vedic religion to varying degrees. Some historians believe that Zoroastrianism, along with similar philosophical revolutions in South Asia were interconnected strings of reformation of a common Indo-Aryan thread. Many traits of Zoroastrianism can be traced to prehistoric Indo-Iranian culture and beliefs, that is, before the migrations that separated the Indo-Aryans and Iranic peoples. Thus, Zoroastrianism shares elements with the historical Vedic religion that also originated in that era. Some examples include cognates between the Avestan word Ahura (""Ahura Mazda"") and the Vedic Sanskrit word Asura ('demon', 'evil demigod'); as well as daeva (""demon"") and deva (""god"") and they both descend from a common Proto-Indo-Iranian religion.
Zoroastrianism inherited ideas from other belief systems and, like other ""practiced"" religions, contains syncretism. Specifically, Zoroastrianism in Sogdia, the Kushan Empire, Armenia, China, and other places incorporates local and foreign practices and deities.
Conversely, Zoroastrian influenced Hungarian, Slavic, Ossetian, Turkic and Mongol mythologies, all of which bear extensive light-dark dualisms and possible sun god theonyms related to Hvare-khshaeta.

Abrahamic religions
Zoroastrianism is sometimes credited with being the first monotheistic religion in history, antedating the Israelites and leaving a lasting and profound imprint on Second Temple Judaism and, through it, on later monotheistic religions such as early Christianity and Islam.
There are clear commonalities and similarities between Zoroastrianism, Judaism and Christianity, such as: monotheism, dualism (i.e., a robust notion of a Devil—but with a positive appraisal of material creation), symbolism of the divine, heaven(s) and hell(s), angels and demons, eschatology and final judgment, a messianic figure and the idea of a savior, a holy spirit, concern with ritual purity, an idealization of wisdom and righteousness, and other doctrines, symbols, practices, and religious features.
According to Mary Boyce, Zoroaster was thus the first to teach the doctrines of an individual judgement, Heaven and Hell, the future resurrection of the body, the general last judgement, and life everlasting for the reunited soul and body. These doctrines were to become familiar articles of faith to much of mankind, through borrowing by Judaism Christianity and Islam; yet it is in Zoroastrianism itself that they have their fullest logical coherence. Since Zoroaster insisted both on the goodness of material creation, and hence of the physical body, and on the unwavering impartiality of divine justice.
The interactions between Judaism and Zoroastrianism resulted in transfer of religious ideas between the two religions and as a result, it is believed that Jews under Achaemenid rule were influenced by Zoroastrian angelology, demonology, eschatology, as well as Zoroastrian ideas about compensatory justice in life and after death. It is also postulated that the Jewish high monotheistic concept of God developed during and after the period of the Babylonian captivity, when the Jews had a prolonged exposure to sophisticated Zoroastrian beliefs.
In addition, Zoroastrian concepts seeded dualistic ideas in Jewish eschatology, such as the belief in a savior, the final battle between good and evil, the triumph of good and the resurrection of the dead. These ideas later passed on to Christianity via Zoroastrian-inspired texts of the Old Testament.
According to some sources, such as The Jewish Encyclopedia (1906), there exist many similarities between Zoroastrianism and Judaism. This has led some to propose that key Zoroastrian concepts influenced Judaism. However, other scholars disagree, finding that the general social influence of Zoroastrianism was much more limited, and that no link can be found in Jewish or Christian texts.
Proponents of a link cite similarities between the two: such as dualism (good and evil, divine twins Ahura Mazda ""God"" and Angra Mainyu ""Satan""), image of the deity, eschatology, resurrection and final judgment, messianism, revelation of Zoroaster on a mountain with Moses on Mount Sinai, three sons of Fereydun with three sons of Noah, heaven and hell, angelology and demonology, cosmology of six days or periods of creation, and free will, among others. Other scholars diminish or reject such influences, noting that Zoroastrianism has a unique theistic doctrine which combines dualism, polytheism and pantheism, rather than being a monotheistic religion. Others say there is little concrete evidence about the precise origin and development of Zoroastrianism, and that Zoroastrianism does not compare with the Jewish belief in the sovereignty of God over the whole of creation.
Others, such as Lester L. Grabbe, have said there is general agreement that Persian religion and tradition had its influence on Judaism over the centuries and the question is where this influence was and which of the developments in Judaism can be ascribed to the Iranian side as opposed to the effect of the Greek or other cultures. There exist distinctions but also similarities between Zoroastrian and Jewish law regarding marriage and procreation. While Mary Boyce claims, besides Abrahamic religions, Zoroastrian influence also extended to Northern Buddhism.

Islam
Zoroastrians are considered to be a ""People of the Book"" by Muslims.

Manichaeism
Zoroastrianism is often compared with Manichaeism. Nominally an Iranian religion, Manichaeism was heavily inspired by Zoroastrianism because of Mani's Iranian origin, and it was also rooted in prior Middle-Eastern Gnostic beliefs.
Manichaeism adopted many of the Yazatas for its own pantheon. Gherardo Gnoli, in The Encyclopaedia of Religion, says that we can assert that Manichaeism has its roots in the Iranian religious tradition and that its relationship to Mazdaism, or Zoroastrianism, is more or less like that of Christianity to Judaism.
The two religions have substantial differences.

Present-day Iran
Many aspects of Zoroastrianism are present in the culture and mythologies of the peoples of Greater Iran, not least because Zoroastrianism was a dominant influence on the people of the cultural continent for a thousand years. Even after the rise of Islam and the loss of direct influence, Zoroastrianism remained part of the cultural heritage of the Iranian language-speaking world, in part as festivals and customs, but also because Ferdowsi incorporated a number of the figures and stories from the Avesta in his epic Shāhnāme, which is pivotal to Iranian identity. One notable example is the incorporation of the Yazata Sraosha as an angel venerated within Shia Islam in Iran.

History
Ancient India
Several śramaṇa movements are known to have existed in India before the 6th century BCE (pre-Buddha, pre-Mahavira), and these influenced both the āstika and nāstika traditions of Indian philosophy. Martin Wiltshire says that the Śramaṇa tradition grew in India over two stages: the Paccekabuddha stage was the tradition of the individual ascetic, and the Savaka stage was the tradition of the disciples. Buddhism and Jainism eventually grew out of these two stages as different religions. These traditions drew upon already established Brahmanical concepts, states Wiltshire, to formulate their own doctrines. Reginald Ray concurs that Śramaṇa movements already existed and were established traditions in pre-6th century BCE India, but disagrees with Wiltshire that they were nonsectarian before the arrival of Buddha.

Schools of Philosophy
In Indian philosophy, there are six major orthodox (astika) schools of Hindu philosophy—Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga, Mīmāṃsā and Vedanta, and five major heterodox (nāstika) schools of Śramaṇa —Jain, Buddhist, Ajivika, Ajñana, and Cārvāka. The four most studied Nāstika schools, those rejecting the doctrine of Vedas, are Jainism, Buddhism, Cārvāka, and Ājīvika.

Charvaka
There is no heaven, no final liberation, nor any soul in another world, Nor do the actions of the four classes, orders, etc., produce any real effect.
The Cārvāka school originated in India around the 6th century BCE. It is classified as a nāstika school. It is noteworthy as evidence of a materialistic movement in ancient India. Followers of this school only accepted pratyakşa (perception) as a valid pramāna (evidence). They considered other pramāna like sabda (testimony), upamāna (analogy), and anumāna (inference) as unreliable. As a result, perception could not support the existence of God or the soul (tman). They also considered everything to be made of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire. The Cārvāka pursued enjoyment of life and the elimination of physical pain. So, they can be considered hedonistic. All of the original Cārvāka texts are considered lost. A much-quoted sūtra (Barhaspatya sutras) by Brhaspati, who is considered the founder of the school, is thought to be lost. The Tattvopaplavasimha by Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa (8th century CE) and the Sarvadarśanasaṅ̇graha by Madhavacarya (13th century) are considered important secondary Cārvāka texts.

Samkhya
Sāṃkhya is an āstika school but has some atheistic elements. Sāṃkhya is a radically dualist philosophy. They believed that the two ontological principles, puruṣa (consciousness) and prakriti (matter), were the underlying foundation of the universe. The objective of life is considered to be the separation of pure consciousness from matter (kaivalya). The reasoning within this system led to the Nir-isvara Sāṃkhya (Sāṃkhya without God) philosophy, which deemed the existence of God as unnecessary. There is the opposing reasoning that accepts God, called Sesvara Sankhya (Sāṃkhya with God). Samkhya Karika (c. 350 CE) is the earliest known systematic text of this philosophy.

Mīmāṃsā
Mīmāṃsā (meaning exegesis) is also an astika school. They believed the Vedas to be author-less and self-authenticating. They did not accept the Vedas as being composed by any ṛishi (saint), they considered them to not be authored by anyone (apauruṣeya). They accepted the minor deities of the Vedas but resisted any notion of a Supreme Creator. They only concentrated on upholding the ṛta (order) by following the duties of the Vedas. The foundational text of this school is the Mīmāṃsā Sutra by Jaimini (c. 200 BCE – 200 CE).

Ājīvika
Ājīvika is yet another nastika school with an atheistic outlook. None of their scriptures survive, and there is some question as to whether or not the accounts of them in secondary sources (often hostile) are accurate. They believed in a naturalistic atomic theory and held that the consequences of natural laws led to a deterministic universe. They denied karma but upheld the atman. They lived in ascetic communities and existed in southern India until at least the 14th century.

Buddhism and Jainism
Jainism rejects the idea of a creator deity responsible for the manifestation, creation, or maintenance of this universe. According to Jain doctrine, the universe and its constituents (soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion) have always existed. Along with this, as 'universal natural laws govern all of the components and actions, an immaterial being like God cannot create a material being like the universe'. Jainism offers an elaborate cosmology, including heavenly beings (devas), but these beings are not viewed as creators; they are subject to suffering and change like all other living beings and must eventually die. Jains define godliness as the inherent quality of any soul characterised by infinite bliss, infinite power, Kevala Jnana (pure infinite knowledge), and perfect peace. However, these qualities of a soul are subdued due to the karmas of the soul. One who achieves this state of soul through right belief, right knowledge and right conduct can be termed a god. This perfection of the soul is called kevalin. A soul thus becomes a liberated soul—liberated of miseries, cycles of rebirth, the world, karmas, and finally of the body as well. This is called moksha.
Gautama Buddha rejected the existence of a creator deity, refused to endorse many views on creation, and stated that questions on the origin of the world are not ultimately useful for ending suffering. Buddhism instead emphasises the system of causal relationships underlying the universe, pratītyasamutpāda, which constitutes the dhamma and source of enlightenment. No dependence of phenomena on a supernatural reality is asserted in order to explain the behaviour of matter.

Philosophers and ancient texts
Ajita Kesakambali was a materialist philosopher. He is mentioned in the Samaññaphala Sutta. He rejected gods, an afterlife and karma. Payasi is a character, referred to as a prince, who appears in the Buddhist text Digha Nikaya in the Payasi Sutta. He did not believe in rebirth or karma. He debated with Kassapa, a disciple of Buddha, and lost according to Buddhist sources.

Jabali's speech from the Ramayana
In the Hindu epic Ramayana (Ayodhya Khanda), when Bharata goes to the forest to convince Rama to return home, he was accompanied by a sophist called Jabali (""जाबालिः""). Jabali uses nihilistic reasoning to convince Rama. He also says that rituals are a waste of food and scriptures were written by smart men so that people will give alms. Rama then calls him a deviant from the path of dharma (""धरमपथात""), refuses to accept his ""nastika"" views and blames his own father for taking Jabali into service. He also equates the Buddha to a thief. On hearing Rama's retort, Jabali retracts his statements, saying that he was merely arguing like a nihilist. However, these verses referring to the Buddha are considered a later interpolation, as those verses use a different metre.

The Carvaka incident in the Mahabharata
A character described as a Carvaka briefly appears in the Mahabharata (in the Shanti Parva). As Yudhishthira enters the city of Hastinapur, a brahmin, referred to as Carvaka, accuses him of killing his own kinsmen and says that he would suffer for it. The accuser is revealed to be a rakshasa in disguise, who was a friend of Duryodhana. He had existed since the Satya Yuga by virtue of a boon from the god Brahma, that he could only be killed when he is showing contempt towards brahmins. He was killed by other brahmins by the chanting of sacred hymns and Yudhishthira was assured that his actions were within the kshatriya code. This event may be a possible denigration of the Carvaka philosophy.

Medieval India
In the 9th century CE, Jain philosopher Jinasena wrote the Mahapurana. The book contains the following often quoted words,

Some foolish men declare that a creator made the world. The doctrine that the world was created is ill-advised, and should be rejected. If God created the world, where was he before creation? If you say he was transcendent then, and needed no support, where is he now?
This quote was also featured later in Carl Sagan's book, Cosmos. In the 14th century, philosopher Madhavacarya wrote the Sarva-Darsana-Sangraha, which is a compilation of all Indian philosophies, including Carvaka, which is described in the first chapter.

Between 1882 and 1888, the Madras Secular Society published a magazine called The Thinker (Tattuvavivesini in Tamil) from Madras. The magazine carried articles written by anonymous writers and republished articles from the journal of the London Secular Society, which the Madras Secular Society considered itself affiliated to.

20th century
Twentieth century India too experienced multiple spiritualism activism trends which weighed in favor of spirituality over religion and rituals.
Periyar E. V. Ramasamy (1879–1973) was an atheist and rationalist leader of the Self-Respect Movement and Dravidar Kazhagam. His views on irreligion are based on the eradication of the caste system, thinking religion must be denied to achieve its obliteration.
Vinayak Damodar Savarkar (1883–1966) was an eminent Hindu nationalist leader of the Indian independence movement. He was also an atheist and a staunch rationalist who disapproved of orthodox Hindu belief, dismissing cow worship as superstitious. Being Hindu, for him, was a cultural and political identity.
Jawaharlal Nehru (1889–1964), India's first Prime Minister was a Hindu agnostic and a self-styled scientific humanist. He wrote in his autobiography, Toward Freedom (1936), about his views on religion and superstition.
Meghnad Saha (1893–1956) was an atheist astrophysicist best known for his development of the Saha equation, used to describe chemical and physical conditions in stars.
Bhagat Singh (1907–1931), an Indian revolutionary and socialist nationalist who was hanged for using violence against British government officials, was a staunch atheist. He laid out his views in the essay ""Why I Am an Atheist"", written in jail shortly before his execution.
Goparaju Ramachandra Rao (1902–1975), better known by his nom de guerre ""Gora"", was a social reformer, anti-caste activist, atheist and disciple of Mahatma Gandhi. He and his wife, Saraswathi Gora (1912–2006) who was also an atheist and social reformer, founded the Atheist Centre in 1940. The Atheist Centre is an institute working for social change. Gora expounded his philosophy of positive atheism as a way of life. He later wrote more about positive atheism in his 1972 book, Positive Atheism. Gora also organised the first World Atheist Conference in 1972. Subsequently, the Atheist Centre has organised several World Atheist Conferences in Vijayawada and other locations.
Khushwant Singh (1915–2014), a prominent and prolific writer of Sikh extraction, was avowedly non-religious.
Founded in 1984 Tarksheel Society (Rationalist Society) is a rationalist group based in Punjab, India.
Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti ( Committee for Eradication of Blind Faith, CEBF) is an organisation dedicated to fighting superstition in India, particularly in the state of Maharashtra. It was founded by Narendra Dabholkar in 1989.
In 1997, the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations was founded.

21st century
Amartya Sen (born 1933), an Indian economist, philosopher and Nobel laureate, is an atheist and he holds that this can be associated with one of the atheist schools in Hinduism, the Lokayata.
Sunday Sapiens, the successor of Maharashtra Rationalist Association, is actively involved in developing scientific temper and eradicating superstition.
In 2008, the website Nirmukta was founded. It later became an organisation aiming to promote free thought and secular humanism in India.
In 2009, historian Meera Nanda published a book entitled The God Market. It examines how Hindu religiosity is gaining more popularity among the rising middle class, as India is liberalising the economy and adopting globalisation.
In March 2009, in Kerala, a pastoral letter addressing the laity was issued by the Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council urging the members to not vote for political parties which advocate atheism. In July 2010, another similar letter was issued.
On 10 March 2012, Sanal Edamaruku investigated a so-called miracle in Vile Parle, where a Jesus statue had started weeping and concluded that the problem was caused by faulty drainage. Later that day, during a TV discussion with some church members, Edamaruku accused the Catholic Church of miracle-mongering. On 10 April, Angelo Fernandes, President of the Maharashtra Christian Youth Forum, filed a police complaint against Edamaruku under the Indian Penal Code Section 295A. In July while on a tour in Finland, Edamaruku was informed by a friend that his house was visited by the police. Since the offence is not bailable, Edamaruku stayed in Finland.
On Friday 7 July 2013, the first ""Hug an Atheist Day"" was organised in India by Nirmukta. The event aimed to spread awareness and reduce the stigma associated with being an atheist.
On 20 August 2013, Narendra Dabholkar, a rationalist and anti-superstition campaigner, was shot dead by two unknown assailants, while he was out on a morning walk.
According to Sultan Shahin of progressive New Age Islam, more Indian Muslims are now questioning their own religion, some consider themselves just cultural Muslim and some consider themselves even as ex-Muslims.
Nastik Nation, an organization was started in the year 2015. This organisation has translated and published the international bestseller, God Delusion and The Greatest Show on Earth by Richard Dawkins in many Indian languages.
On 17 March 2017, H.Farook, an ex-Muslim atheist, was murdered by Muslim radical group in Coimbatore. The murders of Farook joined their close and hidden ex-Muslim organization pretending to be ex-Muslims who has understood the hollow falsehood of Islam and Quran. Later one day they called Farook saying that one of their bikes was out of petrol and needed him to come with some. They attacked in a group and murdered him. It is reported that the group involved practiced thefts and plundering at night and distributed a share of it to the nearby slums like what Mohammed had done in sixth century.
On 9 January 2021, E.A.Jabbar, freethinker, atheist, and rationalist from Kerala and Islamic preacher M.M. Akbar were engaged in a debate on the Quran. Both sides claimed to have defeated the other debater even as there was no clear verdict.
In August 2021, Abdul Khader Puthiyangadi, an Indian citizen and rationalist from Kerala, was arrested by the UAE police in 2021 without bail and sentenced to prison in the UAE for three years for criticizing Islam on social media in his native language Malayalam.
On 10 January 2022, ex-Muslim rationalist Aneesh Jasy from Tamil Nadu was arrested without bail over his Facebook posts against Islam.

Rise of ex-Muslims of Kerala
In 2021 in Kerala, several ex-Muslims formed an organisation called Ex-Muslims of Kerala. It is an organisation founded in 2021 by E. A. Jabbar, Liyakkathali CM, Arif Hussain, and a few others who left Islam in Kerala. The organisation gives support to those who left Islam, a minority that is facing persecution from the Islamic community because of their leaving. The organisation conducts debates with Islamic scholars and fundamentalists on various topics. Ex-Muslims of Kerala observe 9 January as ex-Muslim day as the remembrance of E. A. Jabbar's debate with Islamic preacher M. M. Akbar, by conducting seminars on atheism and Islam.

Legal status, rights and laws
Atheism and irreligion not officially recognised in India. Apostasy is allowed under the right to freedom of religion in the Constitution. According to advocate Asim Sarode, along with constitutional freedom religion and conscience, freedom of expression helps protect atheists in India. Sarode says, Article 51A (h) of Indian constitution expects all Indian citizens a duty to inculcate “scientific temper, humanism and spirit of inquiry and reform.” The Special Marriage Act, 1954 allows the marriage of people with no religious beliefs, as well as non-religious and non-ritualistic marriages. However, there are no specific laws catering to atheists and they are considered as belonging to the religion of their birth for administrative purposes. The box in which the 'caste' and 'religion' are to be filled is still present in a lot of forms. Some of these boxes on forms are also compulsory, and one does not always have the option of leaving them empty. The closest option one gets is 'Choose not to say' or 'Other' as an answer to these boxes.
Ravi Kumar, an atheist from Haryana is another person who is struggling and fighting to be officially and legally irreligious and caste-less in India. He went to court to declare him officially atheist and he got one certificate in which it was mentioned that he had ""No Caste, No Religion, & No God"". Later, Justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa of the Punjab and Haryana High Court said they had exceeded their authority and asked him to return the certificate; he refused to do so. The Fatehabad district authorities who issued the certificate withdrew it in April 2019. Kumar plans to continue his quest to be officially declared an atheist.
Sneha Parthibaraja, a lawyer from Vellore was the first citizen in India to get an official 'no religion, no caste' certificate. She won this right on 5 February 2019, after a nine-year court battle. Indian actor Kamal Haasan, who is known for his atheism, congratulated her on Twitter for this achievement.

Hate speech laws and irreligion
Notable verdicts
On 29 October 2013, the Bombay High Court judged in favour of an atheist school teacher from Nashik. Sanjay Salve had been employed by the state-funded Savitribai Phule Secondary School since 1996. In June 2007, during a prayer session, Salve did not fold his hands during the pledge or prayer. The school management called this indiscipline and refused him a higher pay grade in 2008 when Salve became eligible for it. Salve sought legal recourse citing the article 28 (a) of the Constitution which states ""no person attending any educational institution recognised by the State or receiving aid out of State funds shall be required to take part in any religious instruction that may be imparted in such institution or to attend any religious worship that may be conducted in such institution"". The court ruled in Salve's favour and directed the school to release his dues by 31 January 2014.
On 23 September 2014, the Bombay High Court declared that the government cannot force a person to state a religion on any document or form. The court also stated any citizen has the right to declare that he/she does not belong to any religion. The decision came in response to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by Ranjit Mohite, Kishore Nazare and Subhash Ranware, representing an organisation called Full Gospel Church of God, after the Maharashtra state printing press refused to issue them a gazette notification stating that they belonged to no religion. The petitioners stated that the organisation had 4000 members, and that they believe in Jesus Christ but they do not follow Christianity or any religion. Responding to the petition, the Maharashtra and the central governments had stated that ""no religion"" cannot be treated as a religion on official forms. The court cited the Article 25 of the Constitution, which guarantees right to freedom of conscience, while passing the verdict.

Persecution and attacks
According to Jaswant Zirakh of the Tarksheel Society, Indians are usually comfortable with atheist concepts, but usually it involves popular religious leadership and godmen tending to attack atheism since they tend to worry about losing their power and income. Among the Indian Muslim communities, atheists worry of backlash, they and their families may face social boycott and ostracism including stopping them in participation of funerary rites of their dear ones.
Narendra Nayak, an advocate of atheism, has claimed to have been attacked three times and had his scooter damaged twice, with one of the attacks leaving him with head injuries. This compelled him to take self-defence lessons and carry a nunchaku. Megh Raj Mitter's house was surrounded by a mob after he debunked the Hindu milk miracle, forcing him to call the police.
On 15 March 2007, a bounty of ₹700,000 (equivalent to ₹2.1 million or US$24,000 in 2023) was announced on atheist Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasrin, while living in India, by a Muslim cleric named Maulana Tauqeer Raza Khan for allegedly writing derogatory statements about Muhammad in her work. In December 2013, an FIR was filed against Nasrin in Bareilly by a cleric named Hasan Raza Khan, for hurting religious sentiments. Nasrin had allegedly tweeted on Twitter that ""In India, criminals who issue fatwas against women don't get punished."" Raza Khan said that by accusing clerics of being criminals, Nasrin had hurt religious sentiments.
On 2 July 2011, the house of U. Kalanathan, secretary of the Kerala Yukthivadi Sangham, was attacked in Vallikunnu after he suggested on television that the temple treasures of Padmanabhaswamy Temple should be used for public welfare.
On 16 February 2015, rationalist Govind Pansare and his wife were attacked by unknown gunmen. He later died from the wounds on 20 February. On 30 August 2015, M. M. Kalburgi, a scholar and rationalist, was shot dead at his home. He was known for his criticism of superstition and idol worship. Soon afterwards, another rationalist and author, K. S. Bhagwan, received a threatening letter. He had offended religious groups by criticizing the Bhagavad Gita.

Demographics
Indian government census
The Indian census does not explicitly count atheists. In the 2011 Census of India, the response form required the respondent to choose from six options under religion. The ""Others"" option was meant for minor or tribal religions as well as atheists and agnostics.
The religion data from 2011 Census of India was released in August 2015. It revealed that about 2,870,000 people had stated no religion in their response, about 0.27% of the nation's population. However, the number included atheists, rationalists and also those who believed in a higher power. K. Veeramani, a Dravidar Kazhagam leader, said that it was the first time the number of non-religious people was recorded in the census. However, he added that he believed that the number of atheists in India was actually higher as many people do not reveal their atheism out of fear of discrimination.

Different surveys
World Values Survey (2006)
According to the 2006 World Values Survey, conducted by the Dentsu Communication Institute Inc, Japan Research Center (2006), 6.6% of Indians stated that they had no religion.

WIN-Gallup Global Index of Religion and Atheism (2005 and 2012)
According to the 2005 Global Index of Religion and Atheism report from WIN-Gallup, 87% of Indians were religious and 4% called themselves atheists. According to the 2012 report by the same organisation, 81% of Indians were religious, 13% were non-religious, 3% were convinced atheists and 3% were unsure or did not respond.

Worldviews and Opinions of Scientists in India (2007)
In 2007, a survey was conducted by the Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and culture of the Trinity College with the help of Center for Inquiry (India) called 'Worldviews and Opinions of Scientists in India'. 1100 scientists were surveyed from 130 institutes. Most of them identified themselves as secular (59%) or somewhat secular (16%) but refused to be labelled irreligious. 83% defined secularism, as it appears in the Indian constitutions, as the separation of state and religion. But, 93% also defined it as tolerance of other religious philosophies. 20% equated secularism to atheism. Only 11% called themselves completely not spiritual. However, 8% reportedly said they would refuse to do stem cell research based on religious or moral convictions. Y. S. Rajan commented on this saying that most Indians do not feel there is a conflict between science and religion. Other the hand, Innaiah Narisetti, chairman of Centre for Inquiry (India) and Pushpa Bhargava, the former director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, pointed out the lack of scientific temper among Indian scientists.

Religion Among Scientists in an International Context (2014)
In a survey conducted by Elaine Howard Ecklund of Rice University, it was found that:

The ongoing study has surveyed 1,581 scientists from UK and 1,763 from India.

Gallup International Association (2022)
A 2022 Gallup International Association survey found that 18% of Indians did not believe in God, equating to around two hundred million of the population.

日本人が昔から農耕や漁労など自然と交わり生活を営む中から生まれた信仰といえ、神話、八百万の神、自然や自然現象など多くの事柄を含むアニミズム的、祖霊崇拝的な民族宗教である。神と自然は一体と認識され、神と人間を結ぶ具体的作法が祭祀であり、その祭祀を行う場所が神社であり、聖域とされた。

概要
神道は古代日本に起源をたどることができるとされる宗教である。伝統的な民俗信仰・自然信仰・祖霊信仰を基盤に、豪族層による中央や地方の政治体制と関連しながら徐々に成立した。また、日本国家の形成に影響を与えたとされている宗教である。世の中の宗教名の多くは日本語では「○○教」と呼称するが、神道の宗教名だけは「神道教」ではなく、単に「神道」となっている。
神道には確定した教祖、創始者がおらず、キリスト教の聖書、イスラム教のコーランにあたるような公式に定められた「正典」も存在しないが、『古事記』『日本書紀』『古語拾遺』『先代旧事本紀』『宣命』といった「神典」と称される古典群が神道の聖典とされている。森羅万象に神が宿ると考え、また偉大な祖先を神格化し、天津神・国津神などの祖霊をまつり、祭祀を重視する。浄明正直  (じょうみょうせいちょく)（浄く明るく正しく直く）を徳目とする。他宗教と比べて現世主義的といった特徴がみられる。
日本人の生活と深い関わりのある神道は、当初から宗教として認識されていたわけではなく、仏教が大陸から伝来したのち、それまで日本国独自の習慣や信仰が御祖神（みおやがみ）の御心に従う「かむながらの道（神道）」として意識されるようになった。教えや内実は神社と祭りの中に伝えられおり、『五箇条の御誓文』や、よく知られている童歌『通りゃんせ』など、日本社会の広範囲に渡って神道の影響が見受けられる。
神道の特色の一つとして、外来の他宗教に対する寛容さが挙げられる。神道は仏教や儒教・道教などとも習合し日本文化に大きな影響を及ぼしたが、日本国独自の神観念は変わらず、現在まで脈々と受け継がれている。
神道は奈良時代以降の長い間、仏教信仰と混淆してきた（神仏習合）。日本における神仏習合は、すっかりと混ざり合って一つの宗教となったのではなく、部分的に合一しながらも、なおそれぞれで独立性が維持されている。宮中祭祀や伊勢神宮の祭祀では仏教の関与が除去されていることから、神祇信仰は仏教と異なる宗教システムとして自覚されながら並存していた。明治時代には神道国教化を実現するために、神仏分離が行われた。
神道と仏教の違いについては、神道は地縁・血縁などで結ばれた共同体（部族や村など）を守ることを目的に信仰されてきたのに対し、仏教はおもに人々の安心立命や魂の救済、国家鎮護を求める目的で信仰されてきたという点で大きく相違する。
神道は日本国内で約8万5,000の神社が登録され、約8,400万人の支持者がいると『宗教年鑑』（文化庁）には記載があるが、支持者は神社側の自己申告に基づく数字であり、地域住民をすべて氏子とみなす例、初詣の参拝者も信徒数に含める例、御守りや御札などの呪具の売上数や頒布数から算出した想定信徒数を計算に入れる例があるためである。このため、日本人の7割程度が無信仰を自称するという多くの調査結果とは矛盾する。

分類
皇室神道 (宮中祭祀）
皇居内の宮中三殿を中心とする皇室の神道である。新年の四方拝や歳旦祭、五穀豊穣や国家・国民の安寧を祈る新嘗祭（天皇即位後初の新嘗祭は大嘗祭という）などが行われる。

神社神道
神社を中心に、氏子・崇敬者などによる組織によって行われる祭祀儀礼をその中心とする信仰形態である。
民俗神道
民間神道ともいう。民間で行われてきた信仰行事をいう。道祖神・田の神・山の神・竈神など。修験道や密教や仏教、あるいは道教の思想と習合している場合も多い。いざなぎ流なども入る。
教派神道（神道十三派）
教祖・開祖の宗教的体験にもとづく。創唱宗教的色彩が濃い。
古神道（≒原始神道）
江戸時代の国学によって、儒教や仏教からの影響を受ける前の神道が仮構され、復古神道・古道・皇学・本教などと称された。明治時代以降に古神道だけを取り出し、新たな宗派として設立されたものも古神道と称している場合がある。近代以降の学問で研究されて国学色を排除してからは、純神道・原始神道ともいう。
国家神道
特に近代（明治維新より第二次世界大戦終結まで）において国家の支援のもとに行われた神道を指す名称であり、事実上の国家宗教となっていた。（国家神道#語誌を参照）
以上のような分類をすることができるが、今日、単に「神道」といった場合には神社神道を指すことが多い。
また、何に重きを置くかによって「祭り型」「教え型」という分け方も提唱されている。

祭り型神道（社人神道 - 儀礼を中心とする）
これは上記の「皇室神道」「神社神道」「民俗神道」などのことである。
教え型神道（学派神道 - 教学を中心とする）
神仏習合系 - 両部神道・山王一実神道など
神儒習合系 - 儒家神道・忌部神道・理学神道・伊勢神道（＝度会神道）・垂加神道など
家元神道 - 唯一神道（＝吉田神道）・土御門神道など
復古神道 - 平田篤胤･大国隆正ら
国学系の教団 - 出雲大社教・神道修成派など
霊学系の教団 - 神道天行居など
その他の新宗教
山岳信仰系 - 実行教・御嶽教など
霊示系（創唱宗教） - 黒住教・金光教・天理教・大本など
大本系新宗教 - 生長の家・世界救世教・白光真宏会など
救世教系新宗教（いわゆる「手かざし」系） - 世界真光文明教団・崇教真光・ス光光波世界神団・神慈秀明会など
キリスト教と習合した例 - かくれキリシタンの信仰。一部の新宗教の例（キリストの幕屋）。
その他 -  国外のシンクレティズム的な新興宗教やニューエイジ・心霊主義において神道の神を自らが信じる神と同一視する場合がある。例：天道、ラエリアン・ムーブメントなど。
以上のように分けられる。なお、陰陽道系の土御門神道は上記の家元神道のひとつではあるが、教え型とも祭り型とも決められるものではない。

歴史
神道の起源は非常に古く、日本の風土や日本人の生活習慣に基づき、自然に生じた神観念である。農耕文化の進展とともに、自然の威力に神霊の存在を見出し、その神霊を丁重に祭ることで自然の脅威を和ませ、農耕生活の安寧を祈るという神観念が生じたことが、神道の始まりであった。このためキリスト教、仏教のような開祖が存在せず、縄文時代を起点に弥生時代から古墳時代にかけてその原型が形成されたと考えられている。
現在の神道・神社に直接繋がる祭祀遺跡が出土するのは、農耕文化の成立に伴って自然信仰が生じた弥生時代で、この時代には、荒神谷遺跡などに代表される青銅器祭祀、池上曽根遺跡のような後の神社建築と共通する独立棟持柱を持つ建物、鹿などの骨を焼いて占う卜骨、副葬品としての鏡・剣・玉の出土など、神社祭祀や記紀の神道信仰と明らかに連続性を持つ要素が見られるようになる。魏志倭人伝において、邪馬台国の女王卑弥呼が「鬼道を事とし、衆を惑わすこと能ふ」との記述が見られ、この「鬼道」がシャーマニズム的な要素が強い初期の神道であるとする説が有力である。なお、「鬼」「惑」などのようにネガティヴ的なニュアンスを持つ漢字が用いられたのは、儒教に内包される反迷信的な理念（子曰く「怪力乱神を語るべからず」-『論語』）による所が大きいと考えられる。
大和王権が成立する古墳時代には、最初期の神社と考えられる宗像大社や大神神社で、古墳副葬品と共通する副葬品が出土することから、大和王権による国家祭祀が行われたと推定されており、この時期に神道の直接の原型が形成された。飛鳥時代には律令の整備に伴い、神祇令に基づいた祭祀制度の体系化が行われ、神祇官が全国の神社に幣帛を頒布する班幣制度の確立や、全国の神社への社格区分や神階・神位の授与など、全国の神社を包括する国家的な律令祭祀制度が整備されたため、この時期に体系的な「神道」が成立したとするのが、多くの研究者での概ねの共通認識となっている。
「神道」という名称については「かんながらの道（神道）」と言う意味である。中国の『易経』や『晋書』の中にみえる神道は「神（あや）しき道」という意味であり、これは日本の神道観念とは性質が異なる別個のものである。
日本における「神道」という言葉の初出は『日本書紀』の用明天皇紀にある「天皇、仏法を信（う）けたまひ、神道を尊びたまふ」であるが、このように外来の宗教である仏教と対になる日本固有の信仰を指したものだった。また、稲作のような自然の理法に従う営みを指して神道とする解釈もある。
中世には仏教理論との関連から神道の教義化・内面化が模索され、最終的に仏教から独立した独自の教義・経典・祭祀を持つ吉田神道が形成されて、神道界の主流となった。さらに近世には日本の古典研究に神道が統合されることで国学が成立し、倒幕運動に影響を与えた。こうして近代に入ると、明治政府によって国家神道体制が形成されたが、第二次世界大戦終結後には国家主義的イデオロギーの根源とされた同体制は解体され、現代においては宗教法人として各地の神社が活動している。
明治20年代（19世紀末）になると、西欧近代的な宗教概念が日本でも輸入され、宗教としての「神道」の語も定着し始めた。同30年代（20世紀初）には宗教学が本格的に導入され、学問上で「神道」の語が確立した。

教義
もともと、神道にはイエス・キリストや釈迦のようなカリスマ的創唱者が存在しなかった。政権による土着の民俗信仰との支配的な祭政一致が行われた神道が教義を言語で統一的に定着させなかったのは、古代より「神ながら 言挙げせぬ国」だったからであるとも言われている。そのため、外来諸教と融合しやすい性格を有することになったともいう。神道のような土着の民俗信仰と宗派宗教の併存例は世界各地でみられるものであるが、その多様性は特異なものである。ただ、実際には、仏教公伝の当初から、廃仏派の物部氏と崇仏派の蘇我氏の間でひと悶着もあった。
このように神道には明確な教義がないものの、古事記や日本書紀などのいわゆる「神典」には、神道の基本的な観念をうかがうことのできる記述があり、常世、黄泉などの他界観や、荒魂・和魂、祖霊などの霊魂観、むすひ、惟神（かんながら）、浄明正直などの倫理観、禊祓により罪穢れを払う清浄観などが、神道の基本的な観念と考えられる。
中世には、このような神道古典に見られる基本観念を体系的に追求し、神道の教学化を図る動きが見られた。その最初期の動きは、両部神道や山王神道など、仏教の僧侶たちが仏教の教理に基づいた神道解釈を試みた仏家神道であった。それらの仏家神道説に影響を受けつつ、それに対抗する形で、神宮神官らにより社家の立場からの神道説である伊勢神道が形成された。伊勢神道の教説は、それまでの神道祭祀における観念を、外来宗教の語彙も活用しつつ論理化したものと捉えられ、これまで神道祭祀において重んじられてきた祓や禊などの身体的清浄を心の問題として解釈し、「正直」「清浄」を神道の徳目とした。中世後期には、それまでの中世神道の展開を集大成し、仏教から独立した教義・経典・儀礼を持つ神道説である吉田神道が形成された。吉田神道の教説は、この世の中の現象の全てに神が内在するという汎神論であった。
近世に入ると、儒教の隆盛に伴い、理当心地神道、吉川神道などの儒家神道が盛んになり、神仏習合が強く批判され、儒教の徳目と神道の一致が説かれた。儒家神道を集大成したのが垂加神道で、垂加神道説では神と人が「天人唯一之道」という合一状態にあるとし、神道とは人が神に従って生きることであり、人は神に一心不乱の祈祷を行うことで冥加を得なければならないが、それには人が「正直」でなければならず、その「正直」の実現には「敬（つつしみ）」が第一だとする教説が説かれた。近世中期には国学が出現し、本居宣長は神道を儒教や仏教の教理によせて解釈することを強く批判した。近世後期には、平田篤胤がキリスト教の最後の審判の観念の影響を受けた幽明審判思想を唱えたり、その門人らが天之御中主神を創造神とする単一神教的な観念を展開するなど、近代に連なる教理の展開を遂げた。また、幕末には後期水戸学による神道説も唱えられ、国学と儒教を結びつけることで国体論を説き、尊皇論を唱え、幕末の志士たちの思想に影響を与えた。
近代には神道事務局祭神論争という熾烈な教理闘争もあったが、結局は、政府も神道に共通する教義体系の創造の不可能性と、近代国家が復古神道的な教説によって直接に民衆を統制することの不可能性を認識したため、大日本帝国憲法によって信教の自由が認められた。もっとも、それには欧米列強に対して日本が近代国家であることを明らかにしなければならないという事情もあった。このような経緯から、近代には神社非宗教論が説かれ、神社神道の神職らが宗教的な教義を説くことは政府により禁じられたが、他方で在野の神道家らによる神道教理が説かれるようになり、国家から公認を受けた教派神道13派が独自の神道の教えを説いて活動し、勢力を広げた。

神道における「神」
神道では、気象、地理地形などの自然現象に始まり、あらゆる事象に「神」の存在を認める。いわゆる「八百万の神々」である。アイヌの信仰にも共通点があり、アイヌ語の「カムイ」と「神（かみ）」という語の関係も深いと考えられている。元来、神の姿は、浮遊する霊力で、物に寄り付いたり去っていったりする「魂」と想起されており、非人格的なものであるとされた（そのような性質から、神の分霊を無限に行うことができる）が、仏教の影響で神像などが製作されるようになり、次第に神は可視的なものと考えられるようになった。神は、自然を感じ取り、そのもののままでは厳しい自然の中で、人間として文化的な生活を営むのにふさわしい環境と状態を、自然との調和に配慮しながらバランスを取り調節していき、人民生活を見回って、生活するための知恵や知識のヒントを与えたり、少し手伝ってあげたり、体や物を借りたときや何かやってもらったときなどには少しお礼をしたり、それが、日本の「神（かみ）」が行っていた仕事のひとつであり、日本人にとって「神」は、とても身近な存在であった。
また、神道における神は、理念的・抽象的存在ではなく、具体的な現象において観念されるため、自然現象が恵みとともに災害をもたらすのと同様に、神も荒魂・和魂の両面を持ち、人間にとって善悪双方をもたらすものと考えられている。神は、地域社会を守り、現世の人間に恩恵を与える穏やかな「守護神」であるが、天変地異を引き起こし、病や死を招き寄せる「祟る」性格も持っている。このように神は自然神から人格神へ、精霊的な神から理性的神へ、恐ろしい神から貴い神へ、進化発展があったととらえることができる。
神道の神の種類は、大別すると自然神と文化神の二つに分類ができる。前者には、太陽神や月神、風神、雷神、山神、海神などの天体や地形、気象を神格した神のほか、蛇などの動物神も含まれる。また、文化神は、屋敷神、氏神、産土神などの社会集団を守る神や、疫病神、田の神、漁労神、軍神、竈神など、人間生活における特定の場面や職能を守護する神に分けられるほか、生前業績があった人物を、没後神社を建てて神として祀る風習なども認められる（人神）。神道には、人間も死後神になるという考え方があり、神話に描かれる一族の先祖（祖霊崇拝）や社会的に突出した人物、地域社会に貢献した人物、国民や国のために働いた人物、国家に反逆し戦乱を起こした人物、不遇な晩年を過ごし死後怨霊として祟りをなした人物（御霊信仰）なども「神」として神社に祭られ、多くの人々の崇敬を集めることがある。
1881年の神道事務局祭神論争では、明治天皇の裁決によって伊勢派が勝利し、天照大神が最高の神格を得たが、敗北した出雲派的なものがいまだに強く残っていたり、氏神信仰などの地域性の強いものも多い。
なお、戦前は学校の教科書などに、「神」についての認識の仕方の説明が載っていた。尋常小学校の歴史や修身の教科書などには、少年少女向けの歴史物語として、神話の説明が記載されている。神話の世界はとても人間的な世界で、そこには「神」と「人」を隔てる断絶は存在しない。神もまた、人間のように仕事をし、生活をしている。昭和8年の『少年國史物語』では、「神代の物語」の項目に、「どこの國でも大昔の事ははつきりとは分らないものだが」と前置きをして、神代の事から始まる日本の歴史について「神代といふのは、我が國の大昔に相當の身分であつた方たちを後の世の人が尊敬して、すべて神として崇めてゐるところから、その方たちの時代を指してさう呼んでゐるのである」と説明されている。

神道の研究
平安時代以前より出雲において日本神話との関わりが議論されていたとされ、『出雲風土記』には他所風土記とは違い、そういった性格を色濃くみることができる。
鎌倉時代には伊勢神宮の神官による学問的研究がはじまり、徐々に現在の神祇信仰の形を取るに至った。そして、そうした伊勢派の努力はやっと江戸末期のお伊勢参りの確立によって知識人よりも祖霊性の強い庶民の一部からも支持を得ることに成功した。一方で、本居宣長が江戸期に『古事記』の詳細な注釈を行い、国学の主流を形成していった。これら神道や国学の目覚めが欧米列強に植民地化されつつあったアジアの中で、日本の自覚を促し、明治維新を成功に導く思想的流れの一角を成した。神道が形成される過程において、古代は仏教から強く影響を受け、近世では儒教の日本への流入が大きい。伊勢派の果たしたことはそれに対抗する神道側の努力だったと考えるべきだろう。
神道史の本格的な研究は宮地直一によって体系化された。彼は神代史（神話）と歴史を区別した講義を國學院大學の前身である皇典講究所開催の神職講習会で行い、『神祇史』（皇典講究所國學院大學出版部）として1910年（明治43年）に出版している。
神道の成立期については諸説出されている。おもな説として次の四説があげられている。その第一説は、7世紀後半・8世紀、律令祭祀制。天武・持統天皇朝説。この説は大方の了承を得られる妥当な学説と考える。第二説は、8・9世紀、平安時代初期説。提唱者は高取正男。第三説は、11・12世紀、院政期成立説。提唱者は井上寛司。第四説は、15世紀、吉田神道成立期説。提唱者は黒田俊雄。

現代の神道
神道に属する神々を祭神とする社を神社（じんじゃ）といい、全国の神社の大部分は神社本庁が統括している。なお、神社本庁は「庁」と称しているが、行政機関ではなく宗教法人のひとつである。

皇室と神道
宮中祭祀に見られるように、皇室と神道は歴史的に密接な関わりを持ってきた。記紀神話には、神武天皇が大和橿原の地で即位したのちに鳥見山の祭壇で祭祀を行ったとの記述があり、古代においては祭政一致の観念のもと、神祭りを行うことと国を治めることが一体であり、そのいずれもが天皇の役割であると考えられていたとされる。そして、記紀には崇神天皇の時代に天神地祇を祀る制度が整備されたとされ、律令制の整備が進む飛鳥時代には、神祇官より全国の神社へ幣帛が頒布される班幣制度が整備された。平安時代以降は、天皇が名神大社に対して勅使を派遣して奉幣と宣命の奏上を行わせる名神大社奉幣が盛んになり、次第に二十二社への奉幣と展開した。平安時代の中期以降は、律令制度の弛緩に伴う神祇官の衰退により、天皇の親祭が高まり、年始の元旦四方拝や天皇が内裏で毎朝、「石灰壇」と呼ばれる台で伊勢神宮を遥拝する毎朝の御拝や、即位に際して特定神社へ神宝を送る一代一度の大神宝使の制度が始められたほか、神社の行宮まで天皇が赴く行幸も始められた。
中世の戦乱で、皇室儀礼や皇室の神道儀礼などは廃絶していったが、江戸時代に入ると復興されてゆき、伊勢神宮の神嘗祭に際しての例幣使派遣(伊勢例幣使）は1647年（正保4年）に、二十二社のうちの上七社及び宇佐八幡宮・香椎宮への奉幣は1744年（延享元年）に復興された。天皇の特定神社への奉幣は、近代を経て現代にも受け継がれており、現在では賀茂神社、石清水八幡宮、春日大社をはじめ16の神社が勅祭社とされ、天皇からの奉幣にあずかっている。
多くの日本国民が仏教と神道の習慣と信仰を両立させているように、皇室も神道の祭祀と仏教の行事をともに行っていた。他方で、『貞観儀式』『儀式』などの規定によって、大嘗祭の期間は中央及び五畿の官吏が仏事を行うことが禁じられ、中祀および内裏の斎戒を伴う小祀には、僧尼の代理への参内を禁じ、内裏の仏事が禁じられたほか、平安時代中期以降には、新嘗祭、月次祭、神嘗祭などの天皇自らが斎戒を行う祭においては、斎戒の期間中内裏の仏事をやめ、官人も仏法を忌避することとなるなど、神道儀礼と仏教儀礼は、朝廷においては明確に区分されていた。朝廷の復権を志向した光格天皇以降は、朝廷の儀礼における神道の要素が高まった。明治天皇の代で行われた神仏分離や神道国教化に伴い、仏教と皇室の直接的な関係は薄れたが、皇室菩提寺であった泉涌寺と宮内省の特別な関係は日本国憲法施行時まで続いた。

アニミズムと神道
八百万の神々を信仰対象とする神道は、すべてのものが精神的な性質(人格があるか、擬人化された魂、霊等)を持つと信じるアニミズムの特徴を保持してきたと考えられている。動植物やその他の事物に人格的な霊魂、霊神が宿るとするアニミズムは、非人格的な超常現象、超自然的な呪力を崇拝するマナイズム（呪力崇拝）とは区別される。アニミズムはすべてのものに魂があると主張するのに対し、物活論はすべてのものが生きていると主張する。
たたりを恐れ崇拝の対象とする死霊崇拝は未開宗教におけるアニミズムの一形態とされている。未開社会で行われるシャーマンによる呪術の代わりに、神社では怨霊を鎮めるために神として祀った。死を霊魂の永久離脱として他界に赴くが、死霊や動物霊は定められたときにこの世を訪れ、人に憑いて健康を損なわせるとされる。狐憑き、ヤコツキ、オサキツキは動物霊憑依の例である。
未開社会において特定の氏族、部族が自然現象・自然物や動植物と超自然的関係で結ばれることをトーテムと呼ぶ。南方熊楠は、大物主を蛇トーテムとした。
神道はアニミズム的宗教であり、その特徴の一つに祭政一致がある。祭政一致は英語ではSaisei itchiとしてそのまま神道の用語として用いられており、柳川啓一は祭政一致を職業聖職者が直接統治を行う神権政治とは異なるものとして定義した。原始・未開社会の宗教の超自然観はアニミズム的であり、霊的存在に対して呪術的にかかわる。特定の開祖がなく、儀礼が公的に行われる。法・政治・経済・道徳・慣習などと密接にかかわり、祭政一致し、祭と経済的活動が同一の場で行われ、タブー（禁忌）が法的または道徳的観念・行動と重なる。祭政一致は主として古代天皇制の文脈において言及されてきた。古代天皇制国家の形成において大嘗祭の祭式と密接に結びついて成立した王権神話に象徴されるように、政治主権者は原始・未開社会に遡り宗教祭祀者の機能とは未分化であり、天皇家が諸部族の首長の祭祀権、祖神とその神話を血縁的系譜関係の神話的設定を通して奪い取り政治的統合を実現した。原始・古代社会では風雨雷地震などの自然現象、狩猟・農耕の収穫にいたるまですべて神意と考えられていたが、この思想は古代天皇制国家統一の支柱となり、律令制において神祇官を設置、中世の神道思想から江戸時代の国学へと受け継がれ、明治維新以後は神道国家観によって天皇の「まつりごと」を強調する傾向が生じ、昭和に入ると天皇を現人神とするようになった。
明治維新後の新政府は「太政官布達」で祭政一致し神祇官を再興すると布告した。日本でも巫の告げる神託が政治的な権威をもったヤマト王権の統治体制に遡ることができる。

シャーマニズムと神道
宗教人類学者の佐々木宏幹は、シャーマニズムには次のような3つの要素があるとした。

トランスという特別の精神状態において脱魂（ecstasy）または憑依（憑霊）（possession）が行われる
神仏・精霊などの超自然的存在と直接接触・交流・交信
社会的に一定の役割を持つ信仰と行動の体系
神代紀の天鈿女命、崇神紀の倭迹迹日百襲姫命、仲哀紀の神功皇后などは突然神がかり（憑依）、狂躁乱舞しており、シャーマンの例として挙げられてきた。
山上伊豆母は、4世紀の三輪王朝、5世紀の河内王朝、そして崇仏派の蘇我氏による大化の改新によって律令制国家となる以前の大和朝廷は、三輪氏や多氏といった巫を司る一族と政を司る大王の共同統治が行われてきたと主張している。
シャーマニズムは大きく脱魂と憑依（憑霊）の2つにわけることができるが、東アジア（日本、韓国、台湾、中国大陸）、東南アジアのシャーマンに脱魂（ecstasy）型がないとは言えないが、圧倒的に憑依（possession）型が多い。
小口偉一は、日本の宗教信仰の基底にシャーマニズム的傾向があるとし、神道系新宗教の集団の形成や基盤も同様であるとした。神道系新宗教の教祖らの中には召命型シャーマンの系統に属するものがいると考えられている。

信仰
神社信仰の性格は、大きく分類すると氏神型信仰と勧請型信仰（崇敬祈願型信仰）の2つに分けられる。古代における信仰は、前者の、地域ごとに氏神・産土神を祀る閉鎖的な共同体祭祀が中心であったが、中世に入ると、霊威のある神々が地域を越えて各地に勧請され、個人の祈願が行われる勧請型の信仰が増加した。中世期の律令制の崩壊と荘園制の成立に伴い、特定神社を国家が支える古代的な律令祭祀制度が崩壊し、荘園領主たちが有力神社を本所として荘園を寄進するようになった結果、その寄進された社領にその分霊社が勧請されるようになったことや、各神社が御師をして地方まで信仰を広げる活動をはじめたことなどが、中世期に入って神社信仰が拡散する要因となった。また、中世期の惣村では、村民たちは日常の農耕生活の中で神社に寄り合い、村民の中から一年交代で年番神主が選ばれていたり、オトナ・年寄と呼ばれる古老が取り仕切り若者衆が神事の奉仕に当たる神事運営のための祭りの編成組織である宮座が結成されるなどしたほか、村の取り決めに際しては起請文を記して神に誓約し、一揆の時には一味神水が行われるなど、神社は、民衆の精神的拠り所となっていった。
近世期に入ると、治安や交通の改善によって人々の神社参詣がさらに活性化し、一層庶民の間での神社信仰が広がった。各村では講が結成され、毎年わずかなお金を積み立て、その共同出資をもとに籤で選ばれた代表者が神社に参詣し、講員全員分のお札などを受け取って帰る代参講が流行し、各講は御師や先達と師檀関係を結び、御師は講員の祈祷や参詣における宿泊の便を図った。このようなことから、数百万人が短期間で伊勢神宮に参拝したと記録されるお蔭参りをはじめ、近世期には多数の人々が神社に参詣した。他方で、近世期の神社参詣は、近世社会における輸送組織の発達や道中での宿屋・遊楽施設の充実などにより、道中において様々な名所を見物したり、遊興を行うといった、観光・娯楽的な要素も多く持つものであった。このような観光と寺社参詣の結びつきは、近代を経て現代でも受け継がれており、観光における神社の存在感は大きなものとなっている。この他、現在における神社への信仰は、初詣、お宮参り、七五三、結婚式など、個人や家族の年中行事や人生儀礼において現れている。
以下では、特に全国的に広がった神社信仰について概覧する。

八幡信仰（八幡神社）
古くは八幡神と呼ばれる皇祖神の須佐之男命・五十猛神を、現在は応神天皇、神功皇后として幅広く信仰されている。宇佐国造の祀った宇佐八幡宮がその起源で、早くに神仏習合が進み、朝廷だけでなく源氏など武家の氏神としても全国に広まった。
伊勢信仰（神明神社）
古代に皇祖神の天照大御神を伊勢神宮に祀り、大日如来と習合しつつも早くに神仏分離をした。朝廷からの崇拝を受けたが、歴史的に天皇が参拝した例はごくわずかである。現在は神明神社が各地に鎮座する。
天神信仰（天神神社）
延喜式に複数社見えるよう、本来天神は天津神を指す言葉であったが、菅原道真が死後怨霊として恐れられたあとに神仏習合し、天満大自在天神として神格化された御霊信仰。太宰府天満宮や北野天満宮を中心として広まり、おもに雷神・学問の神として信仰される。
稲荷信仰（稲荷神社）
穀物神の宇迦之御魂神を祀る伏見稲荷大社を起源とし、江戸時代には神大市比売や大年神などとともに、商売繁盛、諸産業の神として厚く信仰された。秦氏の神ともされるが、もとは海神族の神であったと考えられる。
熊野信仰（熊野神社）
多くの名で語られるが総じて皇祖神の須佐之男命を祀る。出雲国造の祀った熊野大社や、熊野国造の祀った熊野那智大社、熊野速玉大社を起源とし、物部氏族系が多く祀る。仏教や修験道などとも深く結びついた。
諏訪信仰（諏訪神社）
出雲神の子で、海神族の諏訪氏の祖・建御名方神とその妻・八坂刀売神を祀る。洲羽国造、科野国造の祀った諏訪大社を起源とし、古代は狩猟、農耕、風、水の神であるミシャクジ神を祀り、鎌倉時代には武神として武家にも広く信仰された。
祇園信仰（八坂神社、津島神社）
元はインド由来の祇園牛頭天王と須佐之男命が習合した信仰。京都府の八坂神社や津島神社、須賀神社を中心に、牛頭天王の八柱の御子・八王子権現とともに蘇民将来説話から疫病除災の神として信仰された。
白山信仰（白山神社）
白山比咩神社を起源とし、白山比咩神と呼ばれる菊理媛神を祀る。水の神として信仰されるほか、伊弉諾尊と伊弉冉尊の仲を取り持った神話から、縁結びの神としても信仰される。
山王信仰（日吉神社）
比叡山の山の神として古くから大山咋神（少名毘古那神と同一か）を祀る。日吉大社を起源として早くに神仏習合し、山王権現として各地の日吉神社や日枝神社に祀られる。疫病除災の神として信仰される。
山神信仰（大山祇神社、山神社）
山の神である大山津見神を祀り、鉱山などでは合わせて金山毘古神とともに信仰される。山への信仰や農耕神としても信仰を集める。
御嶽信仰（金峯山寺、武蔵御嶽神社）（木曽御嶽神社・黒沢御嶽神社・王滝御嶽神社）
金峯山由来の御嶽（みたけ）神社と木曽御嶽山信仰（御嶽講）由来の御嶽（おんたけ）神社があり、前者の御嶽神社には蔵王権現が祀られ、後者は御嶽大神と呼ばれる国常立尊、大己貴命、少彦名命を祭神とする。。
石鎚信仰（石鎚神社）
伊邪那岐命と伊邪那美命の第二子である家宅六神石鎚毘古命を祀る。主に中国四国地方で厚く信仰され、山の神として頂上に祀られていることが多い。
浅間信仰（浅間神社）
大山津見神の娘・木花之佐久夜毘売を祀るが、元は保食神であったか。富士山本宮浅間大社を起源とし、和邇氏族系によって祀られている。富士山との関連で火山の神、火中出産神話から安産の神として信仰される。
春日信仰（春日神社）
中臣氏の祖・天児屋命、天美津玉照比売命（宇迦之御魂神と同神か）、建御雷神の三柱の他、国譲り神話から経津主神も合わせて祀る。春日大社を起源とし、中臣氏族系によって祀られる。
鹿島信仰（鹿島神社）
中臣氏の祖・建御雷神を祀る。本宗の鹿島神宮は春日大社の直接的な起源ともされており、地震を起こす鯰を封じる神とされたほか、建御名方神に勝利したことから武道の神としても幅広く信仰されている。
金毘羅信仰（金刀比羅宮・金刀比羅神社）
元はインド由来の鰐の水神クンビーラと土着の神である大物主神が習合した金毘羅大権現を祀る信仰。御霊信仰の影響で崇徳天皇も合祀された。水の神としての信仰のほか海上交通の守り神として信仰されており、漁師、船員など海事関係者の崇敬を集める。

参拝の方法
簡易な参拝
以下は一般的な参拝の流れである。神社によっては作法が異なることがある。多くの場合、その旨の表示がある。
参拝を行う日は毎月1日と15日がよいとされる。参拝する前に、本来は神の前に向かう前に心身を清める禊が必要である。これは神が「穢れ」を嫌うとされることによるが、現代であれば、一般参拝では入浴・シャワーなどで身体を清潔にしてから参拝する心がけが望ましい。神社に到着し、鳥居や神門をくぐる際は「小揖（身体を15度折り曲げるお辞儀。会釈に相当）」するのが望ましい。このときには脱帽し、服装もきちんと整えるようにする。
次に手水舎にて手水を使い、手口を洗う。これは拍手と神拝詞奏上を行う手口（さらには心）を清める意味合いを持つ、ひとつの禊である。手水の作法としては、

まず、手水舎の前で小揖する。
柄杓を右手で持って水をすくい、その水を左手にかけて清める。
柄杓を左手に持ち替え、右手を洗い清める。
柄杓を再度右手に持ち替え、すくった水を左手に受けて溜め、この水で口をすすぐ。口をすすぐ際には口が直に柄杓に触れないようにする。
これらが終わったあと、使った柄杓を洗い清めるが、このときは水を入れた柄杓を立て、柄に水を流すようにして洗う。柄杓を洗うのには次の人のための配慮という意味合いもある。
洗い終わった柄杓は元の位置に伏せて置き、最後に口と手を拭紙やハンカチなどでぬぐう。
最後にもう一度小揖する。
これらの作法は一連の動作で行うのが好ましい。
なお、巫女の補助がつく場合には、作法は巫女の指示にしたがうようにする。手水を使い終わったら拝礼を行うために参道を通り社殿へと向かう。神前ではまず神への供物として（供物を捧げるほかにお祓いの意味もあるといわれる）賽銭箱に賽銭を奉納する。次に賽銭箱の近くにある鈴鐘を鳴らすが、これには邪気を払う、清らかな音色で神を呼び寄せて参拝に訪れたことを神に告げる、参拝者を敬虔な気持ちにするとともに神霊の発動を願うなどの意味合いがあるとされる。
鈴鐘を鳴らした後に拝礼を行う。拝礼の基本的な作法は、現在は「再拝二拍手一拝」（あるいは「二拝二拍手一拝」「二礼二拍手一礼」）がおもに利用されている。すなわち、

拝（身体を90度折り曲げるお辞儀）を二度行う。
拍手を二度打つ。より具体的には、両手を胸の高さで揃えて合わせ、右手を下方向に少し（指の第一関節ほど）ずらし、その状態で両手を二度打ち合わせて音を出し、ずらした右手を再び揃えて祈念を込め最後に両手を下ろす。
一拝する。
神拝詞を奏上する場合は、再拝→神拝詞奏上→再拝二拍手一拝の順で行う。
というもの。再拝二拍手一拝の前後に深揖（身体を45度折り曲げるお辞儀。最敬礼に相当）を行うとより丁寧である。祈願を行う場合は二拍手と一拝の間に氏名および居住地と願い事を（声に出して、あるいは心の中で）陳べるのが一般的となっている。また、神恩感謝を述べたい場合も同様である。参拝時は、目を閉じることなく目を開けたままが望ましい。正式参拝や祈祷などで玉串を捧げる場合は、上記の深揖と再拝の間で、玉串に祈念を込めて根本を神前に向けるようにお供えする。
一部の神社では作法が異なっており、たとえば、出雲大社や宇佐神宮、彌彦神社では「四拍手」である。伊勢神宮や熱田神宮での神事では「八度拝、八開手」となっている。

注意事項
身内に不幸があった人は50日間（仏式の49日）を経過するまで神社参拝は控える必要がある。死穢の観念からである。
神前に捧げる御饌は、火を通したもの（熟饌）を供える場合、神聖な炎として厳粛に起こされた火を用いるのが望ましい。
一部で女性は音を立てて拍手してはいけないという珍説を信じる者がいるが、間違いである。そもそも拍手は音を立てるものであり、音をかすかにたてる拍手は「忍び手」と言って、性別関係なく葬儀で用いるものである。

概要と特徴
信者数などの統計
日本には、約7万5000の寺院、30万体以上の仏像が存在する。日本最古の官寺である四天王寺、世界最古の木造寺院である法隆寺があり、最古の仏典古文書も日本に存在する。
日本は2013年の統計では約8470万人が仏教徒であるとされる 。一方、現代の日本人は特定の信仰宗教、宗教観を持っておらず、自らを仏教徒と強く意識する機会が少ない人も多いが、ブリタニカ国際年鑑の2013年度版では99%の日本人が広義の仏教徒とされている。
2008年のISSP国際比較調査[宗教](NHK放送文化研究所)によると、宗教を信仰している人は男性の場合40代で19％であるものが50代で41%と急激に数値が上昇し、女性の場合30代の28%から40代で39%と急上昇する結果が出ている。男性は親の葬儀が信仰心を持つきっかけになりやすいとされる。

系譜・宗派
日本の仏教には数多くの様々な宗派が存在する。十八宗と呼ばれる18の宗派は、三論宗・法相宗・華厳宗・律宗・倶舎宗・成実宗・天台宗・真言宗・融通念仏宗・浄土宗・臨済宗・曹洞宗・浄土真宗・日蓮宗・時宗・普化宗・黄檗宗・修験宗である。
1940年の宗教団体法公布以前にはいわゆる13宗56派が公認されていた。13宗とは華厳宗、法相宗、律宗、真言宗、天台宗、日蓮宗、浄土宗、浄土真宗、融通念仏宗、時宗、曹洞宗、臨済宗、黄檗宗である。同法公布後、これら13宗56派は28宗派に再編され、第二次大戦後はさらに分派独立したものが多いが、伝統仏教の13宗の系譜はいずれも現代に引き継がれている。
ここではいわゆる伝統仏教13宗の宗祖と本山を記載する。それ以外の宗や派、比較的近年に成立した仏教系の新宗教については、それぞれの項を参照。

教義上の特徴
伝統仏教13宗はいずれも大乗仏教である。信者数・規模としては、 鎌倉仏教（浄土宗・浄土真宗、日蓮宗、禅宗）が大勢を占めるが、これら鎌倉仏教は、法華経を根本経典としながらも他経典や密教まで大乗仏教を広く取り入れた天台宗（延暦寺）を母体として（あるいはその影響下で）誕生・発展したものである。また、その天台宗の開祖である最澄は、三経義疏で法華経を重んじた聖徳太子の影響の下で、法華経を根本経典とする（中国の）天台宗に傾倒したとされている。このようなつながりの中に、聖徳太子から最澄を経て、鎌倉仏教から現在に至るまでの、日本の仏教の大きな潮流を見ることができる。
日本の内外いずれにおいても、大乗仏教では、出家者のみならず在家者も含めた一切の衆生の救済を掲げるが、日本の仏教、特に、平安二宗（天台宗、真言宗）と鎌倉仏教では、「山川草木悉有仏性（成仏）」とも表現されるように、人間のみならず、動物、植物、更には山川といった無機の自然までも仏性を内包しているとの世界観が概ね共通している点に特色がある。これは、仏教伝来前から日本に根付いていた自然信仰（アニミズム）が仏教に反映したものとされている。その過程としては、特に、日本の仏教の転換期となった平安二宗（天台宗、真言宗）が、いずれも神や死者（霊魂）のいる場所とされてきた「山」を本拠とする「山岳仏教」となったことが大きな影響を与えたとの指摘のほか、平安二宗そのものの自然信仰との親和性、つまり、太陽神起源の大日如来を信仰の中心に据えるなど自然信仰が元々織り込まれている真言宗はもちろんのこと、天台宗においても、根本経典である法華経が救済の平等性を強調するものであるため、万物が平等に仏性を有するとの思想と親和的であったとの指摘もされている。
また、明治維新による強制的な神仏分離が行われる以前は、神道の神と仏は一体で混淆した信仰体系であった（詳細は「神仏習合」を参照）。日本に仏教が伝来したのは『日本書紀』によると、飛鳥時代、552年とされ、仏は新来の「神」として敬われた。6世紀末には既に神宮寺を建立したとされ、日本の仏教は当初から神と仏は同じものとして信仰されていた。その素朴な観念は本地垂迹説として理論化された。さらに日本史における画期となった戦国時代には、天道思想による「諸宗はひとつ」とする統一的枠組みが形成されるようになった。
このように日本の仏教は、日本の文化的・精神的土壌の中で、固有の展開・発展を遂げたもので、インドで釈迦の説いた初期仏教と様相を異にしていることは否定できない。一方で、例えば、親鸞の他力思想や日本における禅宗の展開・浸透について、日本の精神的土壌が仏教を通じて顕現したものであるとするなど、狭い意味での仏教の垣根を超えた形で、日本の仏教の意義・価値を積極的に見出そうとする言説もある。
また、日本の仏教は、日本の社会・文化全体に有形無形の影響を与えてきたもので、宗教以外の分野への思想的影響の例として、禅宗の精神を取り入れたとされる茶道などの伝統文化があるほか、近現代においても、日本の仏教思想が反映された心理療法とされる森田療法が挙げられるとともに、河合隼雄によって日本に普及されたヨーロッパ発祥のユング心理学に基づく心理療法の過程においてさえ、日本人の深層心理への仏教の影響が色濃く見出されるため、仏教の知見・視点が大変有用である旨の指摘がされている。また、現代においては、仏教における瞑想・禅宗の手法を基礎としつつ非宗教的な瞑想技法として体系立てたマインドフルネスが、非仏教国から日本に紹介されるという逆輸入の現象も生じている。

課題
仏陀が説いた元々の初期仏教は、人間はなぜ苦しむのかとの問いを分析的に解明した上で、苦しみから解放される方法を提示するものであり、その後に様々な国・地域で多様な展開を見せた仏教各宗派も、世界観や救済観・方法論の違いこそあるものの、生老病死をはじめとする苦しみからの解放を目的とすることでは本来共通している。しかし、現代の日本の仏教は、葬式仏教との言葉に象徴されるように、大半の人にとっては、葬式をはじめとする死後の法要・儀式を行う存在でしかなく、仏教本来の役割を果たすことはほとんどできていないという指摘がある。
このような課題・現状に対しては、仏教界からも、死という最も重いライフイベントにおいて仏教が果たしてきた役割を肯定的に捉えつつも、そこにとどまることなく、終末医療におけるスピリチュアルケア、災害などの遺族に対するグリーフケア、長寿命・高齢化社会における老いへの向き合い方、つながりが希薄化する地域社会において交流・連携拠点になるなど、現代社会において仏教だからこそ果たすことのできる役割を積極的に見出していこうとする動きが見られるほか、初期仏教・上座部仏教・チベット仏教などでの出家者の集まりである僧伽（さんが）をモデルに、人生に行き詰った際に価値観をリセットする場所（セーフティネット）としての役割を提唱する意見もある。

歴史
飛鳥時代
『日本書紀』によると、仏教が伝来したのは飛鳥時代、552年（欽明天皇13年）に百済の聖王（聖明王）により釈迦仏の金銅像と経論他が献上された時だとされている。しかし、現在では『上宮聖徳法王帝説』（聖徳太子の伝記）の「志癸島天皇御世 戊午年十月十二日」や『元興寺伽藍縁起』（元興寺の成り立ち・変遷を記述したもの）の「天國案春岐廣庭天皇七年歳戊午十二月」を根拠に538年（戊午年、宣化天皇3年）に仏教が伝えられたと考える人が多いようである。歴史の教科書にはこちらの年号が載っている。この他には『梁書』によると、扶桑では大明2年（458年）に罽賓国から僧が来て仏教をもたらしたとされるが、扶桑が日本を指しているとは確定していない。
『日本書紀』には仏教が伝来した際に、起きた騒動についても記されている。欽明天皇が、仏教を信仰の可否について群臣に問うた時、物部尾輿と中臣鎌子ら（神道勢力）は仏教に反対した。一方、蘇我稲目は、西国では皆が仏教を信じている。日本もどうして信じないでおれようか（「西蕃諸國一皆禮之,豐秋日本豈獨背也」）として、仏教に帰依したいと言ったので、天皇は稲目に仏像と経論他を下げ与えた。稲目は私邸を寺として仏像を拝んだ。その後、疫病が流行ると、尾輿らは、外国から来た神（仏）を拝んだので、国津神の怒りを買ったのだ（「昔日不須臣計 致斯病死 今不遠而復 必當有慶 宜早投棄 懃求後福」）として、寺を焼き仏像を難波の堀江に捨てた。
その後、仏教の可否を巡る争いは物部尾輿・蘇我稲目の子供達（物部守屋と蘇我馬子）の代にまで持ち越され、丁未の乱で物部氏が衰退するまで続いた。この戦いは一時的に蘇我氏側が不利となるが、馬子側に参戦していた聖徳太子が四天王に願をかけて戦に勝てるように祈り、その通りになった事から摂津国に四天王寺（大阪市天王寺区）を建立した。馬子も諸天王・大神王たちに願をかけ、戦勝の暁には、諸天王・大神王のために寺塔を建てて三宝を広めることを誓った。このため、馬子は法興寺（別名飛鳥寺、奈良に移ってからは元興寺）を建立した。聖徳太子は『法華経』・『維摩経』・『勝鬘経』の三つの経の解説書（『三経義疏』）を書き、『十七条憲法』の第二条に、「篤（あつく）く三宝を敬へ 三寶とは佛（ほとけ） 法（のり）僧（ほうし）なり」（「篤敬三寶 三寶者 佛 法 僧也」）と書くなど、仏教の導入に積極的な役割を果たした。この後、仏教は国家鎮護の道具となり、皇室自ら寺を建てるようになった。
天武天皇は大官大寺（後の大安寺）を建て、持統天皇は薬師寺を建てた。このような動きは聖武天皇の時に頂点に達した。
百済からは仏教と寺院建築のために瓦などの建築技術が伝わった。最初に採用されたのは飛鳥寺であり、7世紀ごろまでは仏教寺院のみに用いられていた。
日本への公的な仏教伝来は、欽明朝のこととして間違いはないが、公伝以前の民間ルートでの仏教伝来が想定できる。すなわち「私伝」説である。欽明朝以前の仏教伝来の根拠とされる史料に『扶桑略記』記事がある。『扶桑略記』記事は、もと『坂田寺縁起』に記され、延暦寺僧『禅岑記』さらに『大日本国法華験記』に引用されたものに、『扶桑略記』が依拠したが、継体天皇十六年壬寅（522年）春二月に渡来した司馬達等が、大和国高市郡坂田原に草堂を結び、本尊を安置して、帰依礼拝したところ、世人がこれを「大唐の神」なりと呼んだといい、百済の王朝から日本の王朝へという公伝以前に、中国系渡来人によって仏教が既に伝えられていた。また、欽明朝以前の仏教伝来について、『日本国現報善悪霊異記』に、敏達天皇代に大部屋栖野古連が和泉国の海中から「霹靂に当りし楠」を発見して、これで仏像を制作したいと皇后に上奏したところ、皇后は「願ふ所に依るべし」と許可し、そこで大部屋栖野古連は蘇我馬子にこのことを告げたところ、蘇我馬子は池辺直氷田を請えて「仏菩薩の三軀の像」を造らせ、像を豊浦寺に置き、諸人が仰ぎ敬ったところ、廃仏派の物部守屋が「おほよそ仏の像を国の内に置くべからず。なほ遠く棄て退けよ」「今国家に災起るは、隣の国の客神の像を己が国の内に置くに因りてなり。斯の客神の像を出して速忽に棄て、豊国に流せ」と主張した。この「豊国」を九州の豊国とすれば、大和への公伝以前に豊国に仏教が伝わっていて、大和の人々が、九州を特殊な地域として認識していたとみることもできる。また「豊国」について、用明天皇が病気になった時に「朕、三宝に帰らむと思ふ。卿達議れ」と述べたところ、物部守屋と中臣勝海が「何ぞ国神を背きて、他神を敬びむ。由来、斯の若き事を識らず」と主張し、対して蘇我馬子が「詔に随ひて助け奉るべし。詎か異なる計を生さむ」と反論し、時に穴穂部皇子が「豊国法師」を引て、内裏に入ったといい、この「豊国法師」を固有名詞でなく、「豊国」の法師と考えるならば、「豊国」は仏教と関係深い国であったことも否定できない。また、九州の修験道の行場としてで有名な彦山の開創について中国北魏僧・善正が、仏教を日本に弘めるため、渡海して九州北岸に到着したところ、樹木でおおわれた日子山（彦山）の秀麗な姿に心ひかれ、石室を造って住むことになり、これが彦山の霊泉寺のはじまりとされ、その年は531年である。さらに、4世紀ないし5世紀と推定される全国各地の古墳から出土する漢式鏡に、道教の神仙と異なる仏像が表現されている鏡が含まれていることなどからも公伝以前の仏教伝来を想定出来る。
『水鏡』に継体天皇治世中に唐（もろこし）より仏教が伝来した以下の記事がある。

継体天皇時代に仏教の渡来を示しているが、その年時は記されておらず、継体天皇御治世に、唐土より仏教が渡ったことを伝えている。一方、『水鏡』の著者は中山忠親とも、あるいは源雅頼の作ともいわれ、中山忠親は建久六年（1195年）に源雅頼は建久元年（1190年）に薨去しており、継体天皇治世中の唐土からの渡来としても、後代の史料であることは注意を要する。

奈良時代
中国や日本では仏教の発展に伴い律令法の中に僧尼の統制（仏教そのものの統制ではない）を定めた法令（僧尼令）が導入された。だが、中国では、仏教の出家が「家」の秩序を破壊するなど、儒教論理に合わないとされ迫害されたのに対し、日本では鎮護国家の発想の下、僧尼令や僧綱・度牒制度が導入されて官僚組織の一員とまで化したのは興味深いことだと言える（僧正・僧都などは律令制で定められた僧官）。もっともこうした統制について国家が建立した官寺とそれ以外の貴族や民衆によって建てられた民間寺院（私寺）とでは温度差があったともされ、後者に対する統制がどこまで行われていたかについては意見が分かれている。
こうした南都六宗と呼ばれた、三論宗、成実宗、法相宗、倶舎宗、律宗、華厳宗などが大勢を極めた。また、聖武天皇は位を孝謙天皇に譲り、出家した。聖武は妻の光明皇后の影響から信仰に厚く、国分寺、国分尼寺の建造を命じ、大和の国分寺である東大寺に大仏を建造した。出家した聖武上皇は「三宝の奴」とまで称した。仏教が定着するにつれて、実は日本の神々も仏が化身として現れた権現であるという考えである本地垂迹説が起こり、様々の神の本地（仏）が定められ、神像が僧侶の形で制作されることがあった。しかし、仏法が盛んになってくると、今度は戒律などを無視する僧などが増えたりしたため、聖武天皇の時代に鑑真が招かれた。鑑真は東大寺に戒壇を設け、僧侶に戒を授けた。聖武天皇も鑑真から戒を授かった。鑑真は唐招提寺を建立し、そこに住んだ。

平安時代
その後これら寺院群は政治に口を出すようになった。桓武天皇は、彼らの影響力を弱めるために平安京に遷都し、空海及び最澄を遣唐使とともに中国に送り出し、密教を学ばせた。新しい仏教をもって、奈良の旧仏教に対抗させようとしたのである。最澄（天台宗）、空海（真言宗）には、それぞれ比叡山と高野山を与えて寺を開かせ、密教を広めさせた。
『末法灯明記』では平安時代中期が釈迦入滅の二千年後にあたるとされ、正法の千年・像法の千年の後、仏教が滅びる暗黒時代、すなわち末法の世が始まったと考えられた。末法の世にはどんなに努力しても誰も悟りを得ることができない。国が衰え人々の心も荒み、現世での幸福も期待できない。このような人々の状況から、ひたすら来世の幸せを願う浄土信仰が流行した。貴族も阿弥陀仏にすがり、極楽浄土に迎えられることを願って来迎図などを盛んに描かせ、その究極として宇治の地に平等院を建立した。その鳳凰堂の姿形は、正に極楽の阿弥陀仏の宮殿（くうでん）を模したものである。
平安時代末期に入ると社会不安が増大し、広大な所領の持ち主であり裕福であった大寺院は盗賊などに狙われる危険性が高くなった。そこで自力救済として僧侶や信徒が武装したのが僧兵である。だが、次第に僧兵そのものが勢力拡大のための武装集団と化し、対立宗派・寺院への攻撃や朝廷への強訴などの武力行使を行う集団（寺社勢力）として社会の不安要素の1つになっていった。また、寺院内に石垣や堀を巡らせる等の一種の城塞化を進める寺院も現れた。

鎌倉時代
鎌倉時代に入ると、前時代末期からの動乱で仏教にも変革が起きた。それまでの仏教の主流が「鎮護国家」を標榜した国家や貴族のための儀式や研究に置かれていたものが、次第に民衆の救済のためのものとなっていったのである。主として叡山で学んだ僧侶によって仏教の民衆化が図られ、新しい宗派が作られていった。
これらの宗派では、それまでの宗派と違い、難しい理論や厳しい修行ではなく、在家の信者が生活の合間に実践できるような易しい教え（易行）が説かれている。
特に広まったのは念仏思想であった。「南無阿弥陀仏」と念仏を唱え続ける（称名念仏）事で救われるとする法然の浄土宗、浄土宗からさらに踏み込んで「善人なをもて往生を遂ぐ、いはんや悪人をや」という悪人正機の教えを説いた親鸞の浄土真宗（一向宗）、踊りながら念仏を唱える融通念仏や時宗があった。
対して、拡大する念仏を警戒した日蓮は「南無妙法蓮華経」と唱えることで救われるとする日蓮宗を創設した。
このように鎌倉時代には乱立ともいえるほど新しい宗派が誕生した。これらの宗派は、定着するまで例外なく既存の宗派に弾劾されたが、同時に旧宗派の革新も引き起こした。弾劾の中でも日蓮宗の日蓮は過激なことで知られ、他宗を非難し御題目を唱えなければ国が滅ぶと言い、幕府に強く弾圧された。しかし、民衆に浸透し一般化すると、この弾圧も次第に沈静化していった。
鎌倉時代は、武士が貴族から権力を奪い、力を着々とつけていた時代でもあった。この時代には臨済宗と曹洞宗という二つの禅宗が、相次いで中国からもたらされた。力をつけつつあった武士に好まれた事から、鎌倉などに多くの禅寺が建てられ、大いに栄えた。この代表的なものを「鎌倉五山」という。また、虎関師錬が仏教史書である『元亨釈書』を著した。
更に従来の仏教の間でも現状を批判する動きが高まってきた。特に律宗やそこから派生した真言律宗などでは社会事業などに乗り出しながら民衆の救済に加わるだけではなく、自ら国家の指定した戒壇を拒否して独自の授戒儀式を開始するなど、新しい宗派よりも革新的な動きすら見せた。

南北朝・室町時代
1333年に鎌倉幕府が滅亡し、南北朝時代から室町時代には政治的中心地は京都に移る。鎌倉幕府滅亡後に後醍醐天皇により建武の新政が開始されると、五山は鎌倉から京都本位に改められ、京都五山が成立する。足利尊氏が京都に武家政権を成立させると、以前から武士に人気のあった禅宗の五山が定められ、臨済宗は幕府に保護される。室町時代の初期には南禅寺などの禅宗と旧仏教勢力の延暦寺などの天台宗は対立し、初期の幕府において政治問題にもなる。また、尊氏の天龍寺船の派遣に協力した夢窓疎石や弟子の春屋妙葩は政治的にも影響力を持ち、彼らの弟子僧が3代将軍の足利義満時代に中国の明朝と日明貿易（勘合貿易）を開始する際には外交顧問にもなる。
このような武家と仏教界の接近は貴族文化及び武士文化に影響を及ぼし、義満の時代の鹿苑寺（金閣寺）など北山文化や足利義政時代の慈照寺（銀閣寺）など東山文化に融合の跡を見ることができる。室町時代の文化には仏教に影響された水墨画・書院造・茶の湯・生け花・枯山水の庭園など、後世に残る多くの作品が生まれた。また、寺院の中には安定した収入を確保するために、所領からの収入や祠堂銭（供養料）などを元手に金融業に進出するところもあった。また、当時城砦化が進んでいた寺院に資産を預ける人々もおりその資産も元手となった。しかし、高利での貸付に耐え切れなくなった人々が徳政一揆を引き起こし、寺院がその攻撃の対象となることもあった。
僧兵の武術も武士のように洗練され、宝蔵院流槍術のように流派として確立する例もあった。
曹洞宗は地方や庶民の間で影響力を持った。京都の都市商工業者の間では日蓮宗が普及した。ちなみに、この時代の布教者としては浄土真宗の蓮如や日蓮宗の日親などが有名である。

戦国時代
応仁の乱後になると、治安が悪化したため、宗教勢力も僧兵を強化し武力を強化した。法華宗による山科本願寺焼き討ち、天台宗による天文法華の乱など、過激派宗教団体による宗教戦争も起こった。中でも加賀国一揆等の一向一揆は守護大名の冨樫氏を滅ぼし、約80年間に渡って加賀一国を支配した（主に徴税権と裁判権）。石山本願寺などは、さながら大名家のような強固な組織となり、彼らの勢力は守護大名および戦国大名が国を統治する上で何らかの対応策をとることが必須となるほど大きく、大名の多くは妥協の道をとった。
しかし尾張の戦国大名・織田信長は、「天下布武」という方針の下、実力対抗してくる宗教勢力を徹底的に討伐した。延暦寺焼き討ち、長島一向一揆、石山合戦などが有名である。また、信長は、日蓮宗の僧と浄土宗の僧との宗論を主催した（安土宗論）。結果、浄土宗が勝利したため、信長は法華宗に他宗派を非難しないよう約束させた。これも宗教勢力を抑えるための策だったとされる。

安土桃山時代
信長が本能寺の変で死ぬと、彼の家臣の豊臣秀吉が実質的な後継者の座についた。秀吉は概ね信長の路線を引き継ぎ、自身に敵対した根来寺や高野山を屈服させた。一向一揆は秀吉軍と上杉軍から挟撃され瓦解した。さらに有力寺社を大坂城の城下町へ引っ越しさせたり、僧兵の影響力が大きかった大和に弟・豊臣秀長を派遣したり、刀狩・惣無事令によって寺院の武装解除を大きく進めるなど、寺社への統制を強めた。寺院の統制と武装解除は続く江戸幕府でも大きな問題として引き継がれていく。
ルイス・フロイスが1585年に著した日欧文化比較では、この時代の仏教寺院の堕落が指摘されている。

江戸時代
豊臣秀吉の死後に権勢を掌握した徳川家康は、寺院諸法度を制定し、寺社奉行を置き、仏教を取り締まった。人々を必ずいずれかの寺院に登録させるようにし（寺請制度）、布教活動を実質的に封じた。鎌倉仏教にとっては、檀家制度によって全国に寺院が作られたことで、全面展開がなされた。浄土真宗の本願寺は、東西に分裂させられ、勢力を弱体化させられたが、現代に至るまで最大の宗派となっている。全国の修験道は、聖護院を本山とする本山派と、醍醐寺を本山とする当山派のいずれかに属するように規制された。また、朱子学や国学の立場からの排仏論も起こった。
1665年（寛文5年）に江戸幕府は寛文印知と諸宗寺院法度の制定を行い、仏教寺院に寺領を安堵する一方で更なる統制（檀家制度）を行った。幕府は学問を奨励したため、各宗派で、檀林、学寮などと呼ばれる学校が整備され、教学研究が進んだ一方で、新義・異議は禁止された。江戸幕府が日蓮の教義を信じない事を理由に従う事を拒絶した日蓮宗の一派の不受不施派は、禁教令のキリスト教と同様に厳しい弾圧を受けた。
これらの幕府の統制により江戸時代の仏教は堕落したという「近世仏教堕落論」は戦前における宗教史の通説であったが、戦後になると多くの批判が行われた。一方で近世仏教思想の再検討は、未だ不十分な段階である。上からの押しつけと解釈されやすい寺請制度だが、社会の安定に伴い菩提寺を求める民衆の意思も無視できない。仏像も規格化されたものが大量生産され各地の寺に収められたが、美術的な観点はともかく信仰の対象が身近に存在する人心安定の意義は大きい。
1654年(承応3年）に来日した明の隠元隆琦は黄檗宗を布教している。
幕府の寺社政策を担った以心崇伝、天海、日々の職業生活の中での信仰実践を説いた鈴木正三、独力で大蔵経を刊行した鉄眼道光、サンスクリット研究、戒律復興を提唱した慈雲、臨済宗中興の祖と称される白隠らが活躍した。

明治時代
江戸時代後半より本居宣長を祖とする国学の延長により明治維新が成し遂げられ、国学的な明治政権が旧長州藩出身者により形成された。大政奉還により、天皇に政権が返上されると、新政府の神道重視の政策が行われた。上知令や開化政策によって全国で廃仏毀釈運動が行われ、寺院数が減少した。1871年（明治4年）に明治政府は太政官達を出し虚無僧が在籍する普化宗を廃止した。また、僧侶の肉食妻帯、不受不施派やキリスト教の布教が解禁された。神道の教化運動を全国で行った結果教導職の人員不足に陥ったため、仏教を解体し神道主導の基に統合する大教院体制が作られた。欧州の宗教視察から帰国した島地黙雷らは、僧侶の身分と信教の自由を保証するべきとする批判の建白を行い、東西真宗の大教院からの脱退を実現させ、1875年（明治8年）に大教院体制は実質的に瓦解した。
その後、各宗派は教団組織の再編成に入り、日清・日露戦争の戦間期に仏教の近代化を推し進め、西欧の仏教学の導入や、宗門大学の設立等の教育活動、社会福祉活動に進出した。1901年には村上専精が大乗非仏説を主張して大きな反響を呼び、国内外で大乗仏教の歴史と教理に関する研究が盛んとなった。
自由民権運動や日露戦争などが終了した明治時代後期には、天下国家を論じる気運が退潮し、個人的な問題に関心が移るアノミーな社会状況が訪れていた。清沢満之は個人の内面に阿弥陀如来を定置する、主観的な他力信仰である「精神主義」を掲げ、大谷派の改革を試みたが挫折した。しかし、「精神主義」の理念は現代に至るまで引き継がれ、近代仏教の先駆的な運動となった。その後も、近角常観の求道会館など、信念の修養を促す「修養主義」を掲げる仏教運動がいくつも現れ、虚脱状態にあった青年層にアノミーからの打開の道を示した。
明治時代には、既存の宗派から離脱する形で、在家を主要な担い手とする仏教系新宗教が出現し始める。その多くは法華・日蓮宗の系譜に属する人々によって興された。この時代に特に成功した教団として、田中智学の立正安国会や、長松日扇の本門仏立講、杉山辰子の仏教感化救済会があり、その組織運営のあり方は後の日蓮系新宗教に大きな影響を与えた。

大正時代
明治末年の大逆事件に内山愚童らの僧侶が連座したことに衝撃を受けた田中智学は、日蓮の教えを国家や社会活動の基本的な指導理念とする「日蓮主義」と、ナショナリスティックな仏教的国体論を結合させたキャンペーン活動を行い、軍人や知識人を中心に大正時代の流行思想となった。日蓮主義者で有名な人物に宮沢賢治、石原莞爾がいる。1924年（大正13年）には、法華系新宗教の霊友会が発足している。
既存宗派も社会福祉事業にコミットすることで、近代的な宗教団体へと変革する取り組みが行われた。1915年（大正4年）には仏教各宗派懇話会を改称した仏教連合会が発足し、政治と宗教に関する諸問題に仏教界の影響力を行使した。

昭和時代（戦前・戦中）
近代の政府は、神仏判然令以降、太政官布達や断片的な法令、行政上の通達によって宗教を管理してきたが、統一的な法典としては1939年（昭和14年）の宗教団体法が最初であった。国家神道体制が確立する過程で神社は宗教ではないということで公法上の営造物法人として扱われたが、仏教、教派神道、キリスト教の宗教団体は民法の公益法人を適用されないままであった。宗教に関する法律の必要性は政界においても認識されており、1899年（明治32年）には第一次宗教法案が貴族院に提案されたが、否決された。1927年（昭和2年）、1929年（昭和4年）にも宗教法案が議会で提案されるが、審理未了に終わった。宗教団体法の制定によって、一般の宗教団体は初めて法人となり、キリスト教も初めて法的地位を得たが、監督・統制色が強い法律であった。
1932年、血盟団事件が発生した。
1941年3月24日、大日本仏教会（財団法人）が結成され、10月6日には東京で、仏教徒銃後奉公大会がひらかれた。
第二次世界大戦の日本軍では諸外国の従軍聖職者（従軍チャプレン）に相当する職として従軍僧が存在したが軍属扱いであり、宗教者でも徴兵対象であったため僧侶だった兵士が臨時に法事を執り行うなど個人的な活動が中心であった。なお浄土真宗の各教団は軍隊布教使と呼ぶ布教使を派遣し軍人に布教活動を行っていた。

昭和時代（戦後）・平成時代・令和時代
第二次世界大戦後、1945年（昭和20年）12月28日に宗教法人令が制定・施行され、宗教団体への規制が撤廃された。1946年2月6日、仏教連合会が結成された。1951年（昭和26年）に宗教法人令が撤廃され、認証制を導入した宗教法人法が制定された。高度経済成長と時を同じくして、日蓮正宗系新宗教の創価学会や法華系新宗教の立正佼成会などが大きく勢力を伸ばした。創価学会は宗教政党公明党を組織し、政界に影響力を持っている。1970年代には、密教系新宗教である阿含宗や真如苑が伸張し、念佛宗三寶山無量壽寺（無量壽會）もこの時期に生まれた。また、漢訳経典中心であった日本においてチベット仏教・原始仏教・上座部仏教・ヒンドゥー教等の影響を受けた新宗教が増加した。
1980年代には、いわゆる新々宗教ブームが起きた。中でもオウム真理教は当時から良くも悪くも注目の的であったが、1995年の強制捜査以降、1980年代末期から1990年代中期にかけてオウム真理教事件と呼ばれる一連の事件を起こしていたことが発覚し、これをきっかけにして1995年（平成7年）には宗教法人法が一部改正された。

日本仏教史観の変遷
史伝研究の盛んだった中国仏教の影響から、日本では奈良時代に『延暦僧録』などの僧伝が著された。鎌倉時代になると本格的な仏教史伝が著されるようになるが、中でも影響力が大きかったのが凝然の著した『三国仏法伝通縁起』である。この書は、インドから中国を経て日本へと伝播した仏教諸宗の教学を総合的に俯瞰したもので、その仏教史モデルは三国仏教史観として近代に至るまで長らく用いられた。
明治時代に入り、宗門外の仏教学者にも自由に仏教研究が行えるようになると、学術的視点を取り入れた新たな日本仏教通史が著されるようになる。明治末から大正時代には鎌倉新仏教の祖師たちが現役だった時期を日本仏教の頂点と考える、鎌倉新仏教中心史観が形成され始める。原勝郎は、日本仏教史とキリスト教史の発展段階を対比させた『東西の宗教改革』（1911年）を著し、国家仏教として出発した日本仏教が鎌倉期に頂点を迎え、その後衰退したという基本的な図式を示し大きな影響を与えた。
マルクス主義が隆盛した戦後の歴史学においても、鎌倉新仏教を反権力・民衆解放のムーブメントとして評価する、近代的な問題意識から見た鎌倉新仏教中心史観が家永三郎や井上光貞らの研究によって成果を上げ、長らく影響を与え続けた。しかし、1970年代から、黒田俊雄の『顕密体制論』を皮切りとして鎌倉新仏教中心史観への疑義が生じるようになる。黒田の『顕密体制論』は論争を呼び修正を余儀なくされたが、結果的に鎌倉新仏教中心史観を打破する転機となり、それまで旧仏教と呼ばれて軽視されていた中世の顕密仏教研究や、近世仏教堕落論の再検討が盛んとなった。

概要
「日本にいつキリスト教が到来したか？」という日本の歴史上の問いに関しては、歴史的・学問的に見て証拠が多く、高等学校日本史の文部科学省検定済教科書で、キリスト教の日本への最初の伝来となっているのは、「1549年にカトリック教会の修道会であるイエズス会のフランシスコ・ザビエルによる布教」である。
戦国時代のさなかであり、当初は、ザビエルたちイエズス会の宣教師のみで、キリスト教の日本布教が開始された。
宣教師たちは、日本人と衝突を起こしながらも布教を続け、時の権力者織田信長の庇護を受けることにも成功し、順調に信者を増大させた。
しかし、豊臣秀吉の安土桃山時代には、勢力を拡大したキリスト教徒が、神道や仏教を迫害する事例が起こった。他、ポルトガル商人によって日本人が奴隷貿易の商品となって海外に人身売買ているという話も出ており、これを耳にした秀吉は、バテレン追放令を発布し、宣教を禁止した。秀吉が奴隷貿易に怒って追放令を発したとの説もあるが、最新の研究はこの説を否定している。

しかし、この時は南蛮貿易の利益が優先され、また下手に弾圧すると、九州征伐で平定したばかりの九州での反乱が考えられたため（当時の日本では、特に宣教開始の地である九州地方でキリシタン大名や信者（キリシタン）が多かった）、本格的な追放は行われず、宣教活動は半ば黙認されていた。だが、サン＝フェリペ号事件が起きたころ、秀吉はキリスト教の本格的な弾圧を開始した。
やがて時代が移り、関ヶ原の戦いで勝利を収めて豊臣政権に代わって、天下統一を成し遂げた徳川家康の江戸時代には、一時的に布教は認められた。しかし、その後は江戸幕府が禁教令を出し、キリスト教を禁教として鎖国政策を採ったため、宣教師はもちろん、外国人も許可無しでは日本に入国できなくなった。
一方で檀家制度を整備して、キリスト教徒をあぶり出すため、庶民に踏み絵を踏ませた。その間、江戸時代の末まで、一部の信者たちが密かにキリスト教の信仰を伝えていくこととなった。この信者たちのことは「隠れキリシタン」と呼ばれている。
やがて明治維新が起き、江戸時代は終わった。明治には欧米列強と不平等条約を結ばされ、諸外国と対等になろうと必死であった明治政府は日本の近代化を図り、富国強兵や殖産興業、文明開化といった政治・法律・経済・軍事など、西洋式に倣ってあらゆる分野の改革を断行した。その中には、国内でのキリスト教の布教・国民の信仰許可も含まれており、完全ではなかったものの信教の自由が法的にも保障された。
以後、キリスト教は再度日本での布教を開始していった。戦国時代ではカトリックが主であったが、明治以降はプロテスタントや正教会など、各派が布教を行った。この時、クリスマスなどのいくつかの行事が日本に持ち込まれ、日本の文化の一つとして定着していった。
第二次世界大戦が始まると、「敵国の宗教」ともみなされたキリスト教も神道や仏教など他の宗教と同じく、政府・大本営から戦争協力を命じられ、それを拒絶した宗教団体は、特別高等警察から徹底的に弾圧されることとなった。第二次世界大戦がと日本の敗北で終結すると、日本ではほぼ完全な形での信教の自由が日本国憲法で（第20条）保障され、不自由のないキリスト教の布教が開始された。
英国国教会とルーテル教会はフランシスコ・ザビエルを崇敬し、命日の12月3日を記念日としている。日本二十六聖人についてもルーテル教会、英国国教会、聖公会は殉教した日の2月5日または翌日の2月6日を記念日としている。

現在、キリスト教の文化は（教会での結婚式やクリスマスなどに象徴されるように）日本の文化に様々な影響を与えている。しかし、日本は公的機関が宗教の割合を詳しく調査していないので不明な点もあるが、キリスト教の信者そのものは、カトリック・プロテスタント・正教会の全てを合計しても、日本人全体の1%前後程度といわれている。文化庁の宗教年鑑では、信者数で1%となっている。また、CIAの調査によると、日本のキリスト教徒の割合は1.5%ほどと推定されている。東京基督教大学の日本宣教リサーチによれば、2014年の日本のキリスト教人口は約104万人で、日本の全人口のうち、0.82%となっている。2018年も信者数の概数は105万人で、対人口比で0.83%で、概数は変わっていない。
各国の宗教団体には普遍的に見られることだが、日本のキリスト教団体も、教義や伝道方法への考え方の相違、行動方針や政治的主張を巡っての対立があり、多くの諸団体に分かれている。それぞれの団体は、協力、もしくは対立関係にある。

戦国時代から安土桃山時代
背景
16世紀、ドイツ（当時の神聖ローマ帝国）でマルティン・ルターが起こした宗教改革が各国に波及しており、カトリックのお膝元のイタリアでさえ教皇の権威に陰りが見えていた。
カトリック教会は、権威を取り戻すために遠くアジアでの布教活動も視野に入れ始めていた。信者数が増えればプロテスタント勢力への牽制にもなる。また、金銭的な問題からも、アジア布教は急務と教会上層部は考えていた。当時は贖宥状（免償符）への風当たりが強くなったため、売り上げが急減しており、カトリックの財政事情に影響を及ぼしていた。アジアの有力者を信者にすれば、カトリック教会への莫大な献金が期待できた。なお、贖宥状の金銭での売買は、トリエント公会議の決議によって1563年に禁止されている。
このようなヨーロッパの宗教事情が、日本にイエズス会やフランシスコ会の宣教師が入国する下地となっていった。
宣教師は、アジアへ活発に派遣されていった。まず、植民地化が進んでいたインドや東南アジアに大量に送り込まれた。宣教師たちはさらに東にも目を向け、やがて極東にまで進出してくるようになった。

フランシスコ・ザビエルによる宣教活動
イエズス会（カトリック教会の修道会）の創設メンバーの一人で、西インドで宣教活動に従事していたバスク人司祭フランシスコ・ザビエルがマラッカで知り合った「ヤジロウ」（アンジロウとも）という日本人によって、日本のことを知り興味を抱いたことが、日本における宣教活動のきっかけとなった。農民の家の子供であるフェルナン・メンデス・ピントは支那沿岸から颶風（ぐふう・熱帯気候 低気圧の旧称の風）に遭って薩摩の種子島に漂着したのであるが、そこからまたインドに渡ったりして、先に日本から伴って行った勘四郎に教理を教えて聖霊降臨日の大祝日に洗礼を受けさせた勘四郎と云う男（洗礼名、パウロ）と日本人の従者二人（ヨハネとアントニオ）が日本人で最初の洗礼を受けたカトリック信者である
1549年に始まるザビエルによる宣教活動が、日本へのキリスト教の最初の伝来で、これは歴史事実として教科書等に記述されて、一般にも広く知られている。

フランシスコ・ザビエルとイエズス会
ザビエルは、ヤジロウやコスメ・デ・トーレス、ジョアン・フェルナンデスらとともに8月15日（この日は「聖母マリアの被昇天の祭日」に当たり、ザビエルは日本を聖母マリアに捧げた。）鹿児島に上陸し、2年3か月にわたって宣教活動を行った。
ザビエルは「日本国王」（天皇）の宣教許可を得ようと薩摩藩から平戸、山口、堺を経て京にたどりついたが、当時の京都は戦乱で寂れきっていた。天皇の権威も失墜しており、征夷大将軍も不在であったため、ザビエルは目的を果たせなかった。その後、言語や文化の違いなど多大な困難を乗り越えながら、徐々に日本人協力者を得ることができ、700名ほどに洗礼を授けた。各地を旅する中で、ザビエルは日本文化に中国が大きな影響を与えていると見抜き、中国宣教を志して広東の上川島に上陸したが、中国本土を目前にして病没した。
日本人を「もっとも優秀で理性的な国民」であると評価したザビエルは、イエズス会本部にさらなる宣教師の派遣を依頼。それに応えて優秀な人材が積極的に日本に送られた。ザビエル以降、ガスパル・ヴィレラ、ルイス・デ・アルメイダ（豊後府内に日本最初の病院を開設）、ルイス・フロイス（織田信長や豊臣秀吉と会見し、『日本史』を記す）、ガスパール・コエリョなどのイエズス会員が日本に来航し、布教活動にあたった。
また、ザビエルは日本の首都に神学部、法学部、ならびに医学部を兼ね備えたカトリック系の総合大学を建学するという夢を抱いていたが、彼の夢は1913年にイエズス会士によって上智大学が東京に建学したことによって叶えられた（ただし、上智大学において医学部は設置されていない）。なお「上智」とは「ソフィア」の訳である。

日本での布教活動
日本では、他の植民地化されたアジア地域と異なりヨーロッパの影響が及ばず、本国の軍事的・経済的な支援が無かった。そのため、宣教師たちはまずその土地の大名などの有力武将と会見し、南蛮貿易の利益などを訴えながら布教の許可を得ると共に、安全の確保を図った。これ以前、1543年にはポルトガルの船が種子島に難破しており、火縄銃などが伝来していた。大名は、独自に南蛮人との交易の道を模索している真っ最中であり、その南蛮との窓口になりうるザビエルたちは、来日当初、大名たちから基本的に歓迎された。
布教の中心的な役割を果たしたのは、ロレンソ了斎・籠手田氏・一部氏・木村氏（末次平蔵の父親の末次興善・セバスチャン木村）・ガスパル西・トマス西らなど、肥前国の平戸島・生月島の者達であった。
この過程の中でキリスト教に触れた大名たちの中にも、洗礼を受けるものが現れた。彼らがキリスト教を信仰した理由は、キリスト教の理念に真剣に惹かれた者の他、単に南蛮との貿易をより円滑かつ大規模に行いたいため、または南蛮の文化や科学技術を習得する目的から信仰するようになった者もいた。彼らはキリシタン大名と呼ばれており、特に有名なものとして大友宗麟、大村純忠、有馬晴信、結城忠正、高山友照および高山右近親子、小西行長、蒲生氏郷などがいる。
なお布教当初は、言葉の問題や、ヤジロウが聖書のデウス（神）を「大日」と訳したこと、ザビエルらが仏教発祥の地であるインド（天竺）から来たこと、日本人の間で「外来の宗教と言えば仏教」という考えが強かったことなど、複数の要因からキリスト教は「天竺教」「南蛮宗」などと呼ばれ、仏教の一派と誤解されることも多かった。布教当初、「知らずに仏教用語を使っていたことがキリスト教の正確な理解を妨げている」と認識したザビエルらは、すぐに仏教用語をできるだけ廃した「原語主義」を採用していくこととなる。

イエズス会の宣教方針に則り、日本における宣教方針は、日本の伝統文化と生活様式を尊重すること、日本人司祭や司教を養成して日本の教会を司牧させることにおかれた。これは同時代のヨーロッパ人の、非ヨーロッパ文化に対する態度としては他に例をみないものであった。「適応主義」と呼ばれたこの指針によって日本での宣教は順調に進んだ。しかし日本人には司祭になる能力も適性もないと考えて軽視したフランシスコ・カブラルが布教長であった時代、ポルトガル人と日本人たちの間で溝が深まって宣教活動が停滞した。

イエズス会本部からの巡察師として日本を訪れたアレッサンドロ・ヴァリニャーノは各地を回って実情を視察した上で、カブラルを解任してその方針を否定、従来行われていた適応主義の復活を命じた。ヴァリニャーノは日本人司祭の養成を急務とし、各地にセミナリオ（小神学校）とノビシャド（修練院）、コレジオ（大神学校）を設置した。これらの学校では当時の学術語であったラテン語、日本語および哲学・神学、自然科学、音楽、美術、演劇、体育と日本の古典を必修科目として学習させていた。これは人文主義的素養を重視したイエズス会の教育方針によるもので、イエズス会による教育は日本の明治以降の学校教育の先取りともいえるものであった。
さらにヴァリニャーノは将来の日本を担う少年たちに直接ヨーロッパを見せ、同時にヨーロッパに日本の存在をアピールしようと天正遣欧使節（1582年 - 1590年）を企画。イエズス会員に伴われた四人の少年たち（伊東マンショ、原マルティノ、千々石ミゲル、中浦ジュリアン）はヨーロッパ各地で熱狂的な歓迎を受け、使節の企画は大成功を収めた。

宣教師の受けた誹謗中傷
宣教師に対する誹謗中傷の中でも顕著なものに、人肉を食すというものがある。フェルナン・ゲレイロの書いた「イエズス会年報集」には宣教師に対する執拗な嫌がらせが記録されている。

さらに子どもを食べるために宣教師が来航し、妖術を使うために目玉を抜き取っているとの噂が立てられていた。仏教説話集『沙石集』には生き肝を薬とする説話があり仏教徒には馴染みのある説といえ、ルイス・デ・アルメイダ等による西洋医療に対する悪口雑言ともとれるが、仏僧である大村由己が執筆した『九州御動座記』にある宣教師が牛馬を生きたまま皮を剥いで素手で食べるとの噂とも共通するものがある。

社会的摩擦
日本初の南蛮外科医である修道士ルイス・デ・アルメイダは、有馬晴純は領内にあった十字架を倒し、キリスト教徒が元の教えに強制改宗するように命じたと1564年十月十四日付、豊後発信の書簡で言及している。1563年十一月七日頃には横瀬浦港にある修道院が焼かれ、次いですぐにキリシタンの農民たちの家が焼かれたという。1573年には深堀純賢によってトードス・オス・サントス教会が焼き払われた。こうしてキリスト教と仏教の信者間での対立関係が悪化していたが、日本におけるイエズス会の責任者であるヴァリニャーノは寺社の破壊を禁じていた。

豊臣秀吉とキリスト教
織田信長は宣教師たちに対して好意的であった。信長の後を継いだ豊臣秀吉も基本的に信長の政策を継承し、宣教師に対して寛大であった。
しかし、秀吉の天下統一目前の1587年、九州征伐の途上で宣教師やキリシタン大名によって多数の神社や寺が焼かれ、仏教徒が迫害を受けていることを知り、また、日本人がポルトガル商人によって奴隷として海外に売られていたこと、そして最大の要因である長崎・浦上・茂木がイエズス会領となり且つ要塞化されていることなどを理由とし九州征伐完了直後、筑前箱崎において、秀吉に謁見するため長崎から来ていた布教責任者であるガスパール・コエリョに対し、バテレン追放令を発布し宣教師の国外退去命令とキリスト教宣教の制限を表明した（この時、秀吉がバテレン追放令を発布した理由については、さまざまな説がある。詳細はバテレン追放令の項を参照）。
これに対してコエリョは、有馬晴信などキリシタン大名に秀吉と敵対するよう要請、さらに武器・弾薬の支援を約束した。しかし有馬晴信は、既に天下人の座をほぼ手中に収めていた秀吉と敵対する気はなく、この要請は実現されなかった。以後、イエズス会は秀吉を刺激するのを恐れ、公の宣教活動をしばらく控えるようになる。
一方、秀吉は追放令を発布こそしたが、以後も実質上キリシタンは黙認したため迫害などはほぼ行われなかった。なぜなら秀吉はポルトガルを通じての南蛮貿易に積極的であったため、追放令の徹底を図らなかったと考えられている。そのため、宣教師たちは立場こそ不安定だったものの、この時点ではまだかなり自由な宣教活動を続けていた。
1591年、インド総督の大使としてヴァリニャーノに提出された書簡（西笑承兌が秀吉のために起草）によると、三教（神道、儒教、仏教）に見られる東アジアの普遍性をヨーロッパの概念の特殊性と比較しながらキリスト教の教義を断罪した。秀吉はポルトガルとの貿易関係を中断させることを恐れて勅令を施行せず、1590年代にはキリスト教を復権させるようになった。勅令のとおり宣教師を強制的に追放することができず、長崎ではイエズス会の力が継続し、豊臣秀吉は時折、宣教師を支援した。
現在、神奈川県中郡大磯町の澤田美喜記念館に伝わる絵巻物『ご聖体の連祷と黙想の図』は、この時期の1592年（天正20年）に製作されたと目され、日本に現存するもので最古級のキリスト教絵画とされる。
しかし、豊臣政権の末期になってスペイン領であったフィリピンとのつながりが生まれ、フランシスコ会やドミニコ会などの修道会が来日するようになると事態は複雑化する。彼らは日本宣教において、当時のイエズス会の（社会的に影響力を持つ人々に積極的に宣教していくという）やり方とは異なるアプローチを試み、貧しい人々の中へ入っての直接宣教を試みた。けれども、これらの修道会がイエズス会のように日本文化に適応する政策をとらずに秀吉を刺激した（たとえば日本では服装によって判断されると考えたイエズス会員の方針と異なり、彼らは托鉢修道会としての質素な衣服にこだわった）ことや、イエズス会とこれら後発の修道会の対立が激化したことで、日本での宣教師の立場は徐々に悪化していく。
そして1596年のサン＝フェリペ号事件をきっかけに、秀吉はキリスト教への態度を硬化させ、1597年、当時スペインの庇護によって京都で活動していたフランシスコ会系の宣教師たちを捕らえるよう命じた。これが豊臣秀吉の指示による最初のキリスト教への迫害であり、司祭や信徒あわせて26人が長崎で処刑された（日本二十六聖人の殉教）。

江戸時代
秀吉没後、実権を掌握した徳川家康は当初キリスト教宣教を黙認していた。たとえば1598年にはスペイン人宣教師ヘロニモ・デ・ヘスースにスペイン船来航の斡旋を依頼し、江戸における教会の建設と布教許可を与えており、東京駅八重洲北口遺跡からはこの頃のキリシタン墓が、帰依したと思われるアジア人の人骨とともに見つかっている。家康はキリスト教そのものには一貫して無関心であった。これは、三河一向一揆で宗教に苦しめられた記憶があったからとの説がある。家康は将軍職を徳川秀忠に譲り、大御所として駿府に引退した後の1607年にもイエズス会員フランシスコ・パジオを引見し、外国人宣教師の滞在と布教の許可を与えている。
しかし一方で家康は海外との貿易の実利を求めていた。1600年にオランダ船リーフデ号が漂着し、イングランド人航海士ウィリアム・アダムスやヤン・ヨーステンが家康に仕え始めると、家康は、彼らから最新の欧州事情の情報を得た。かつての強国スペイン・ポルトガルに対して、新興のイングランドやオランダがアルマダの海戦や八十年戦争（オランダ独立戦争）などで勝利して追い上げている当時のヨーロッパ情勢を理解し、両陣営を競わせながら貿易の実利を得ることを狙っていたのである（ウィリアム・アダムスは、実際にアルマダの海戦に参戦していた）。
また、プロテスタント国家のオランダは「キリスト教布教を伴わない貿易も可能」と主張していたため、家康にとって宣教師やキリスト教を排除する理由はない代わりに積極的に保護する理由もなかった。事実、オランダは東南アジアの植民地において、（経済的な搾取や文化の弾圧は行っていたものの）現地の宗教や政治形態に対してはあまり干渉しない方針を基本としていた。
しかし1612年に岡本大八事件（有馬晴信がからんだ疑獄事件）が起こると、関係者がどちらもキリシタンであったことから、家康はそれまでの態度を一転して諸大名と幕臣へのキリスト教の禁止を通達、原主水などキリシタンであった旗本が改易された。翌年になると側近以心崇伝の手による「排吉支丹文」によってキリスト教信仰の禁止が明文化され、全国で迫害が行われるようになった。1616年に徳川家康が亡くなると、「東照大権現」とされて神として祀られたこともキリスト教禁止に影響を与えたとする見方もある。
1616年のニ港制限令は、イギリス商館長リチャード・コックスが江戸にいる間のことだったが、これはコックスがオランダとイギリスに関してした発言が彼が意図した以上に幕府に警戒感を抱かせたことが発端となった可能性が指摘されている。
1619年に京都で52名が殉教し、1622年に長崎で55名が殉教（元和の大殉教）、1623年江戸でも55名が殉教した（江戸の大殉教）。以後、禁教令の解除まで約250年の間、キリスト教徒は幕府と幕府の庇護する仏教徒、神道信者などにより迫害されることになる。
ただ、禁令の徹底は地方によって異なり、例えば松前藩などは、幕府に対して「領内にはキリシタンはなし」と報告していたものの、実際には取り締まりは緩く、多くのキリシタンが本州から逃れてきていた。松前藩のこの姿勢は、1637年に島原の乱が起きてキリスト教禁止の命令が徹底されるまで続いた。
一方、神仏習合・多神教の宗教的秩序の上にあり、天皇・院（太上天皇）自らが神道の祭祀を主宰し、仏教の祈祷を実修し続けてきた朝廷にとって、一神教のキリスト教は早くから警戒され、排除が試みられる対象であった。キリスト教禁止は江戸幕府と朝廷が連携・協同して取り組める方針で朝幕関係にとっても望ましかった。

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		

アメリカ合衆国の歴史家ジョージ・エリソンはキリスト教徒迫害の責任者をナチスのホロコーストで指導的な役割を果たしたアドルフ・アイヒマンと比較した。

島原の乱
1637年に肥前島原と肥後天草で百姓身分の者たち（農民やかつてキリシタン大名の家臣であった元武士たちなどから構成された）3万人が蜂起した事件は、幕府に衝撃を与えた。これが島原の乱である。蜂起の直接的原因は島原藩と唐津藩（天草を所領）による残酷な収税制度にあったが、同地にはキリシタン大名であった有馬晴信、小西行長の統治時代に入信したキリシタンが多く、一揆の盟約結成の求心力としてキリスト教信仰を基盤においた内部統制も行われたこと、そのことが一向宗、法華宗などのような求心性の強い宗教勢力が排他的な一揆的結合の核となって強大な政治勢力を築いた事態の再来する危機を感じさせたこと、さらには幕藩体制のゆがみが明るみに出ることを幕府が恐れたことから「キリシタンによる反乱」と単純化されて規定され、原城陥落後に1名の内通者を除く参加者全員が殺害された。なお、当時の島原藩主松倉勝家は、農民の生活が成り立たないほどの収奪を行ったかどで斬首され、同様に唐津藩主寺沢堅高は天草の領地を没収されて、その後自害している（江戸期を通じて、一藩の藩主が切腹でなく斬首となったのはこの松倉勝家の1例のみである）。
この事件を重く見た幕府は、禁教を徹底させる観点から、カトリック国であるポルトガルとの断交を望むようになり、1638年にはカピタン・モールの将軍への謁見を拒否している。また、キリシタンをあぶりだすために絵踏や、キリシタンを密告した者に報奨金を与えようとした。だが幕府は、ポルトガルがマカオからもたらす中国産の生糸などに日本市場が大きく依存していたことから、ポルトガルとの貿易の途絶をためらった。
しかし、1639年に、オランダ商館長のフランソワ・カロンが江戸に参府した際に、幕府はオランダの植民地である台湾経由でも中国産の生糸などを確保できることをカロンから確認できたことで、ポルトガルとの断交に踏み切ることになった。そして、長崎奉行や西国大名に、ポルトガル船の来航の禁止と、九州沿岸の防備体制の確立を求めた通達(「第五次鎖国令」)を発布し、ポルトガルを長崎の出島から追放した。1641年には、商館にあった西暦に関するものを理由として、オランダの商館も平戸から長崎の出島に移転され、商船の入港が統制・制限されるようになった。各地で宗門改制度や檀家制度が整備されると、キリスト教の禁止は幕藩体制の根幹に組み込まれていく。
キリスト教の禁令はローマカトリック教会に限定されていたわけではなく、平戸のオランダ倉庫はキリスト教の年号(1639年)を使用したことを理由に破壊され、オランダ人墓地も同時期に破却、死体は掘り返され海に投棄された。1654年、ガブリエル・ハッパルトは長崎での陸上埋葬の嘆願をしたが、キリスト教式の葬儀や埋葬は認められず、日本式で行うことを条件に埋葬が許可された。
オランダ人の記録によると、徳川家光はオランダ人の宗教がポルトガル人の宗教と類似したものであると理解しており、オランダ人を長崎の出島に監禁した理由の一つにキリスト教の信仰があったとしている。
エンゲルベルト・ケンペルは1690年代の出島において、オランダ人が日本人による様々な辱めや不名誉に耐え忍ばなければならなかったと述べている。キリストの名を口にすること、宗教に関連した楽曲を歌うこと、祈ること、祝祭日を祝うこと、十字架を持ち歩くことは禁じられていた。

鎖国
壊滅したかに見えたキリスト教徒たちであったが、九州の一部などでは信徒たちが宣教師たちの教えを口伝えに伝え、水方や帳方といった信徒組織を形成することで、親から子へ、子から孫へと密かに信仰を伝えていった。これが隠れキリシタン（潜伏キリシタン）である。彼らは仏教徒を装いながらも信仰をひたすら守り、キリスト教を自由に信仰できる日が来るのを待ち続けた。
それでも発覚する場合があり、一つの地域で大勢のキリシタンが一斉に見つかり、信仰共同体が崩壊する、いわゆる「崩れ」がたびたび起こった。濃尾崩れのように、信者の大量処刑により、キリシタンがほぼ根絶されて幕を閉じた事件もあれば、浦上一番崩れや浦上二番崩れ、天草崩れのように、混乱を恐れ江戸幕府が、信者を赦免した事例もある。
ヨーロッパのカトリック教会は、キリスト教徒が完全追放された日本に興味を持ち続けた。日本における教会の発展と受難の物語はヨーロッパで語り継がれ、多くの人々がこの東洋の国への再宣教の日が来ることを待ち続けた。
鎖国令以降、江戸期の日本に渡航した数少ない宣教師の一人に、イタリア人教区司祭ジョバンニ・シドッチがいる。シドッチは鎖国下の日本への渡航を願い、教皇庁に許しを求めていた。教皇庁は殉教することが明白な地に司祭を送ることはできないと拒絶したが、シドッチの再三の願い出に教皇クレメンス11世は特別な許可を与えた。
1708年、シドッチは苦労の末に屋久島へ上陸したが、すぐに捕らえられ、長崎を経て江戸に送られ、死ぬまで切支丹屋敷にいた。江戸では儒学者新井白石が取り調べにあたったが、シドッチの人格の高潔さと学識に感銘を受け、尋問というよりは対話という形で、多くの新知識を学び取った。その成果が『西洋紀聞』『采覧異言』である。

アイヌへの布教
アイヌは、数多くのカムイを崇拝する独自の宗教観を有していた。　
江戸時代の初期、蝦夷地（現在の北海道）の一部を治めていた松前藩は、アイヌが「日本風俗に化し染まぬ様」にすることを掟としており、日本語使用、和人風の服装をした場合は罰則があったため、独自の宗教観を保っていたが　イエズス会のジロラモ・デ・アンゼリス神父、ディエゴ・カルヴァリヨ神父がやってきて、大千軒岳の麓に生活し、布教を行った。　島原の乱以後、徳川家光は、キリシタンをなくすように指令を出し、松前藩は106名の蝦夷キリシタンを1639年（寛永16年）に処刑した。
ロシア人も交易を目的として上陸する一方、正教を布教したりしていた。明治以降色丹島に集められた北千島アイヌの集落には、教会が建てられ、キリスト教を信仰していたとする記録が残っている。樺太アイヌにもロシア正教会が布教を行った記録があるが、改宗者は少数であったことが報告されている。
1779年、厚岸にロシア人イワン・アンチーピンが上陸するできごとがあった。幕府は、すでに千島列島や択捉島に住むアイヌに、キリスト教が布教されている情報を得ていたため、国泰寺を建立するなどして、キリスト教が広まらないようにした。

幕末から明治
アメリカ合衆国からの要求をきっかけに、日本は西洋諸国に門戸を開くようになった。1858年には日米修好通商条約や日仏修好通商条約などが結ばれたことで、外交使節や貿易商と共に多くの宣教師たちが来日した。
1846年4月30日にバーナード・ジャン・ベッテルハイム医療宣教師が琉球王国に到着し、8年間迫害の中で宣教活動を行い、琉球語に聖書を翻訳した。

カトリック教会の復興とキリスト教解禁
カトリック教会のローマ教皇庁は、鎖国期を通じて日本への再宣教の方策を模索していたが、19世紀半ばには日本に開国の兆しありと見て、フランスに本部を置くパリ外国宣教会 (Missions Étrangères de Paris; M.E.P.) に日本への宣教師派遣を依頼した。こうして1844年にテオドール・フォルカード (Théodore-Augustin Forcade) 神父（司祭）が那覇に派遣され、2年滞在して日本への渡航許可を再三求めたが、果たせず1846年に帰国した。しかし、同年にフォルカードを初代教区長として日本使徒座代理区が設立され、その後1855年からユジェンヌ・エマニュエル・メルメ・カション (Eugène-Emmanuel Mermet-Cachon)、プリュダンス・セラファン＝バルテルミ・ジラール (Prudence Séraphin-Barthélemy Girard)、ルイ・テオドル・フューレ (Louis-Théodore Furet) の3人の司祭が那覇に赴任して日本語を学んでいたが、1858年に日仏修好通商条約が結ばれたことで、日本入国が可能になった。メルメ・カションは函館に赴き、ジラールは江戸を経て横浜に拠点を構えた。ジラールは1862年、横浜に開国以来最初のカトリック教会となる聖心教会（その後移転し、現在の山手教会）を建てた。このころ、ヨーロッパのカトリック教会の強い関心が日本に寄せられていた証左として、1862年に「日本二十六聖人」の列聖が行われたことがあげられる。

1864年になってフューレは長崎に土地を購入、後から加わったベルナール・プティジャン (Bernard-Thadée Petitjean) 神父（後に司教）と共に1865年に教会堂を建てた。これが大浦天主堂である。一か月後、教会を訪れた婦人たちが自分たちは禁教下で信仰を守り続けた潜伏信徒（隠れキリシタン）であることを告白、神父は驚愕した。これを「長崎の信徒発見」という。信仰を表明した信徒の多くはカトリック教会に復帰して司祭の指導を受けるようになった。
しかし、彼らは同時に寺請制度を拒否したために長崎奉行所が迫害に乗り出し（浦上四番崩れ）、1867年に成立した明治新政府も慶応4年3月15日（1868年4月7日）に五榜の掲示という高札を掲示してキリスト教禁教を継続したため、信徒への拷問や流刑などが行われた。明治政府が刑事罰を与えたキリスト教徒はカトリックに留まらず、他の地方でも東北で正教会への日本人改宗者が投獄されるなど、キリスト教弾圧が全国的に行われた。
だが、明治政府の予想に反して、キリスト教禁止と信徒への弾圧は諸外国の激しい抗議と反発を引き起こした。岩倉使節団が欧米諸国を視察した際、キリスト教の解禁が条約改正の条件であるとされ、1873年（明治6年）にキリスト教禁止令は解かれた。

カトリック教会の動向
1846年から、日本での宣教を委託されていたパリ外国宣教会は、復興当初から宣教のみならず教育事業と社会福祉事業に力を注いでいた。
なお、1884年（明治17年）には、信者数は30,230名、司祭数54名、伝道士252名、教会数は84であった。

教育事業
1872年にはプティジャン司教の招きによってフランスからサン・モール会（現：幼きイエス会）が招かれている。最初の5人の修道女たちは横浜に修道院と孤児院を建てた。1888年には彼らの手で築地教会の近くに高等仏和女学校が開かれた。これが後の雙葉学園の前身である。プティジャン司教は同じくフランスの女子修道会であるショファイユの幼きイエズス修道会にも修道女の派遣を依頼、これに応えて1877年に来日した4名は神戸で孤児院と学校（後の大阪信愛女学院）を開いた。1878年にはシャルトル聖パウロ修道女会が来日、函館に仏蘭西女学校を開設し、1882年には神田教会の敷地内に孤児院や小学校を建てた。同学校は白百合学園へと発展していく。1887年には、パリ外国宣教会の招致に応えて5人のマリア会員が来日し、翌年東京都に暁星学園が創立された。さらにマリア会によって1891年には長崎市に海星学園が、1898年には大阪市に大阪明星学園が、1901年には横浜市にセント・ジョセフ学院が創立された。
なお、キリシタン時代の日本において活躍したイエズス会は、「日本にカトリック高等教育機関を」という教皇庁の求めによって明治期の終わりになって来日し、1913年に上智大学を開いている。

社会福祉事業
この時期、パリ外国宣教会の司祭たちは、政府によって活動を制限されていたため、日本人信者の協力を得て慈善事業・社会福祉事業に力を注ぎ、主に下層階級への宣教活動を行った。
1877年には築地教会の信徒であった本多善右衛門によって浅草にフランス語学校「玫瑰（まいかい）学校」（後の浅草教会）が設立された。この学校は児童福祉施設としても機能していた。1888年、パリ外国宣教会の司祭ジャン・ピエール・レイは、玫瑰学校に収容されていた孤児たちが青年へと成長し、職業訓練等が必要になり、もっと大きな施設が必要と考え、高木甚三郎の協力を得て関口に移転し「聖母仏語学校」（後のカトリック関口教会）を設立した。これらを代表とする学校は、表向きは「フランス語学校」であるが、実態は児童福祉施設であり、また政府によって活動を制限されていた外国人宣教師たちの宗教活動を補助するための機関でもあった。

1873年に来日した司祭のジェルマン・レジェ・テストウィードは、1880年に西関東・東海道地方を担当した。この巡回伝道の旅行中、足柄街道筋の水車小屋で30歳ぐらいの盲目の女性ハンセン病患者と出会い、療養所の設立を決意する。1889年、静岡県御殿場市に療養所を設立。彼は上司に設立許可を願うにあたり「らい患者が現世の苦しみによって永遠の生命を得ることができたら苦しみも又幸せとなるでしょう。そのために病院を建て、そのことを教えたいと思います。こうして彼らは肉体の救いと共に魂のたすかりを得ると思います」と説明した。彼はこの病院に「主における復活」の意味で「神山復生病院」と命名、これが日本最初のハンセン病療養所となった。1898年には、ジャン・マリー・コール
により熊本県熊本市にもハンセン病療養所（待労院）が創設された。

1878年に長崎県の外海地区（現・長崎市）に赴任したマルク・マリー・ド・ロは、この地域の人々の生活が貧しく、孤児や捨子も多く、特に海難事故で一家の働き手である夫や息子を失った家族が悲惨な生活を送っていることを知り、1880年に孤児院を開設し、1883年には救助院（黒崎村女子救助院）を設立して授産活動を開始する。この施設に修道女として入院した婦人たちは、ド・ロの技術指導に基づき、織布、編物、素麺、マカロニ、パン、醤油の製造などを行った。ここで製造されたシーツやマカロニ、パンなどは外国人居留地向け、素麺や醤油などは内地向けに販売された。
このように、パリ外国宣教会に委託されたカトリック教会は、下層階級を中心に宣教活動の一環として積極的に慈善事業を行った。

教区の変遷
1846年に設立されパリ外国宣教会に委託された日本使徒座代理区は、1876年に日本北緯使徒座代理区、日本南緯使徒座代理区の2区に分割された。日本北緯使徒座代理区は横浜に司教座を置いて北海道、東北、関東および中部の各地方を管轄区域とし、日本南緯使徒座代理区は長崎に司教座を置いて近畿、中国、四国、九州の各地方を管轄した。日本北緯使徒座代理区は、1877年に司教座を東京築地教会に移し、1891年には北海道と東北地方を分離（函館使徒座代理区）して東京大司教区となった。日本南緯使徒座代理区は、1888年に日本中部使徒座代理区が新設されたことにより近畿、中国、四国の3地方を委譲し、管轄は九州地方のみに縮小。同年、司教区に昇格して長崎司教区となった。

プロテスタント教会の動向
プロテスタントの宣教師として最初に来日したのは1859年5月到来の米国聖公会ジョン・リギンズ (John Liggins) と6月来日のチャニング・ウィリアムズ (Channing Moore Williams) であった。これを皮切りに1859年中には，「ヘボン」とよばれたアメリカ合衆国長老教会の医師ジェームズ・カーティス・ヘップバーン (James Curtis Hepburn) （10月17日）をはじめとし、アメリカ・オランダ改革派教会から派遣された宣教師サミュエル・ブラウン (Samuel Robbins Brown) とグイド・フルベッキ (Guido Herman Fridolin Verbeck)、医療宣教師ダン・B・シモンズ (Danne B.Simmons) などが続々と来日した。さらに翌年の1860年にはバプテスト教会のジョナサン・ゴーブル (Jonathan Goble)、1861年にはアメリカ・オランダ改革派教会（ダッチ・リフォームド、現RCA）の牧師ジェームズ・バラ (James Ballagh) などが日本の土を踏んだ。これがプロテスタント各教派の最初の宣教師グループである。

やや遅れて1869年にはアメリカ伝道委員会（アメリカン・ボード） (American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions) のダニエル・クロスビー・グリーン (Daniel Crosby Greene) が来日し、1873年には米国メソジスト監督教会宣教師メリマン・ハリス (Merriman Colbert Harris) が函館に着任した。
近代以降の日本のプロテスタントを語る上で欠かせない三つの流れがある。それは「横浜バンド」、「熊本バンド」、そして「札幌バンド」である。ここでいうバンドとは「団体」という意味である。

1862年にヘボンの開いた横浜英学所（ヨコハマ・アカデミー）は、ジェームズ・バラの弟ジョンに引き継がれ、バラ学校と呼ばれていた（バラ学校は1880年に築地居留地に移転して築地大学校となる）。1872年、押川方義（東北学院創立者）らバラ学校の青年たちが信仰を告白し、洗礼を受けた。このグループが「横浜バンド」である。同じ年、横浜に最初の教会「日本基督公会」（海岸教会）が開かれた。1873年にはサミュエル・ブラウンの自宅に集まった青年たちによって「ブラウン塾」が発足。生徒の中には前出の押川方義のほか、青山学院の院長となる本多庸一や、明治学院創設メンバーである井深梶之助、植村正久らがいた。このバラ学校とブラウン塾の流れから1877年に東京一致神学校が生まれ、1887年に東京一致英和学校（築地大学校の後身）・東京英和予備学校と統合した上で白金に移転して明治学院が誕生した。また，一時帰国していたブラウンと共に1869年に来日したメアリー・キダー (Mary E. Kidder) が、ヘボンの診療所で教育していた。ここから後のフェリス女学院が誕生する。
1871年、熊本洋学校に教師として招かれた元陸軍士官L・L・ジェーンズ (Leroy Lancing Janes) は会衆派教会の熱心な信徒であり、彼の感化によって教え子たちが信仰に入った。「熊本バンド」（1876年）と呼ばれたこのグループは、熊本洋学校廃止によってジェーンズが大阪英学校に移るとこれに従い、ジェーンズが勧めたことで（新島襄が1875年に開いた）同志社英学校に加わった。その中に宮川経輝、小崎弘道（同志社第二代社長）、海老名弾正（第八代同志社総長）らのメンバーがいた。

札幌農学校（現在の北海道大学）で教壇に立ったW・S・クラーク (William Smith Clark) とメリマン・ハリスの薫陶を受けた教え子によって結成されたのが「札幌バンド」（1877年）である。クラークの教え子たちの中には佐藤昌介、大島正健、内村鑑三、新渡戸稲造、植物学者の宮部金吾、土木工学の広井勇らがいた（内村鑑三はのちに「無教会主義」を唱えることになる）。
日本のプロテスタントはこれらのグループを核として発展した。横浜バンドの流れから「日本基督教会」が、「熊本バンド」から日本組合基督教会が生まれた。そしてアメリカとイギリスの聖公会の流れから日本聖公会が、メソジスト系の諸派から日本メソヂスト教会が誕生した。
1872年にはジェームス・ハミルトン・バラ宣教師によって横浜に日本基督公会が設立され、1873年（明治6年）にはキリシタン禁制が解除された。フルベッキ宣教師が日本政府左院の翻訳顧問となり、グリーン牧師やジェームス・カーティス・ヘボン宣教師らとともに新約聖書翻訳に取り組んだ。初期の宣教師たちの宿願であった日本語訳聖書の出版事業もこの時期精力的にすすめられ、1880年に新約聖書、1888年に旧約聖書が出版された。
1873年までに、ほとんどのプロテスタントの教派が来日した、1874年創立の神戸の摂津第一公会は、当初から会衆制を採った。
1880年にはイギリス発祥のキリスト教青年会（YMCA）の日本支部が発足した。
1882年時点で日本に在留していた宣教師は138名であった。初期の宣教師は聖書信仰と保守的な神学を持ち、その宣教の情熱の背景にはアメリカの大覚醒と呼ばれたリバイバルがあった。循環するリバイバルがアメリカのキリスト教の特徴である。ブラウンら宣教師は大覚醒運動の影響を受けていた。アメリカの宣教師によって日本に福音主義（エヴァンジェリカリズム）が伝えられた。

福音派（特にホーリネス運動）の源流の一つで「松江バンド」（1893年）も特筆に値する。1890年の聖公会牧師バークレー・バックストンの松江市での伝道が始まりであり、竹田俊造、三谷種吉、堀内文一らを輩出。1897年9月26日にバックストンの招きにより、パゼット・ウィルクスが来日し、日本伝道隊（1904年）や日本イエス・キリスト教団、関西聖書神学校などの設立に関わった。三谷種吉は日本最初の音楽伝道者であり、今も歌われる讃美歌「ただ信ぜよ」、「神は愛なり」を歌いながら、伝道した。
1878年5月15-17日に、第一回全国基督教信徒大親睦会が開催され、1880年に第二回が開かれていたが、1882年は耶蘇退治の迫害があった。1883年の5月8-12日に開催された第三回全国基督教信徒大親睦会からリバイバルが起こり、全国的に広がった。5月14日の基督教大演説会には四千人を集めた。1884年の同志社リバイバルは、3月17日の祈祷会で最高潮を迎え、200名の学生が信仰を告白して、洗礼を受けた。
「日本のプロテスタントは教育中心、上流階級と中流階級に対する伝道を行ってきた」といわれる。日本の初期のプロテスタントの指導者は特に知識階級、佐幕派の士族階層が中心だった。

教育事業
アメリカの宣教師を中心に、日本での明治初期のミッションスクール創設にあたっては、カトリックより早く、日本における女子教育の嚆矢ともいえる。
1869年（明治2年）、アメリカの宣教師らが東京を視察し、ミッションスクール「カロザース塾」を開校、現在の女子学院中学校・高等学校の源流となる。
1870年（明治3年）、米国改革派教会が婦人伝道師メアリー・エディー・キダーを派遣しフェリス女学院を創設する。
1871年（明治4年）には、1861年から横浜に滞在していたジェームズ・H・バラの要請に応え、米国婦人一致外国伝道協会 (WUMS) のメアリー・P・プラインらにより〈ドリーマス・スクール〉が設立される（現：横浜共立学園中学校・高等学校）。
1873年（明治6年）、米国伝道会から派遣された女性宣教師イライザ・タルカットとジュリア・ダッドレーが神戸の宣教師団の支援の元に私塾を開校（現：神戸女学院中学部・高等学部）。

正教会の動向
日本における正教会伝道は、1861年にはロシア正教会のニコライ・カサートキンが来日し、函館の領事館付き修道司祭に着任したのが嚆矢である。当初からニコライは「日本人への伝道・日本正教会の建設」を志して修道司祭となっており、活動を領事館付き司祭の枠にとどめる考えはなかった。派遣したロシア正教会上層部もまた同様の考えであった。その後もニコライは、この基本方針を貫いた。
函館・仙台の人士が初期の信徒を構成したため、函館・東北地方での浸潤がまず始まった日本の正教会だが、1872年に神田駿河台の土地2300坪を得て、宣教の拠点とした。1874年5月には布教会議が東京で開催される。1880年にはニコライは主教に叙聖され、この時からロシア正教会から派遣される主教を待たずに司祭・輔祭を叙聖することができるようになり、日本正教会の神品が増加する環境が整った。1880年には現存するものの中では日本最古の木造教会建築である、石巻ハリストス正教会の聖使徒イオアン会堂が完成。1891年には東京復活大聖堂（ニコライ堂）が竣工する。
また出版事業に重きを置いたニコライにより、各種祈祷書・聖歌譜が日本語に活発に翻訳されていった。1882年に帰国した山下りんにより各地の聖堂のイコンが描かれていった。また日本に着任していた修道司祭アナトリイの甥でもありピアノ・チェロの奏者でもあったヤコフ・チハイが同年頃に来日し、聖歌教師として聖歌の普及に努めた。正教会は急速に教勢を拡大していく。
しかし1891年の大津事件にみられるように日本の対露感情が悪化していく中、ロシア正教会から伝道された日本の正教会もまた各地で迫害を受けていく。1904年にはついに日露戦争が開戦される。この時、ニコライ主教は日本にとどまり、「諸君は皇軍の為に祈れ」と言い、苦難の下にあった日本人正教徒たちを激励し続けた。ニコライは内面では、度重なるロシア軍の敗報に苦悩していたが、あくまで日本人の指導者・日本の正教会の主教という姿を貫き通すことになる。同時に日露戦争時、日本の正教会は日本政府と協力し正教徒ロシア人捕虜の世話に当たり、「日本正教会」でありかつ「日本人のためだけではない正教会」である姿を両立させることとなった。
日露戦争終結直後、日比谷焼打事件の際には東京復活大聖堂もあわや暴徒に襲撃されるところであったということからも、当時の日本の正教会が置かれた立場が垣間見える。こうした逆境にもかかわらず、1911年、ニコライが大主教に昇叙された年には、日本正教会の教勢は教会数265箇所、信徒数31,984名、神品数41名、聖歌隊指揮者15名、伝教者121名に達した。これは当時の日本にあって、カトリック教会に次ぐ規模であった。
明治最後の年、1912年にニコライは永眠、76歳であった。この時、明治天皇から恩賜の花環が与えられた。外国人宣教師の永眠に際して花環が与えられたのは異例のことであった。ニコライの伝道はその後、日本ハリストス正教会に結実する。

明治から大正
明治初期から中期にかけては、国を挙げて欧化政策が進められたため、西欧精神の中枢であるキリスト教に関心を持つ日本人が増えてきた。福澤諭吉がキリスト教国教会論を主張し、上流階級がキリスト教に殺到した時代である。なお、1895年のカトリック教会は、信徒数50,302人、司教4人、司祭はパリ外国宣教会士88人、マリア会士27人、邦人司祭20人であった。プロテスタントは1888年末に249教会、信徒15,514人、宣教師451人、日本人教役者142人、神学校14校、神学生287人、年間の受洗者は約7,000人を数えた。正教徒の信徒数は17,000人であった。
しかし明治中期以降、日本が富国強兵政策をとって近代国家への歩みを模索し、国粋主義的思想が強まるようになるとキリスト教への見方にも変化が起こる。1889年に発布された「大日本帝国憲法」では日本が立憲君主制国家たることを宣言しているが、この中で信教の自由は限定的なものとされた。さらに天皇に対する忠誠を説く「教育勅語」（1890年）で明治日本における天皇の位置づけが明確に示された。国家の核としての天皇と国家神道の位置づけが明確にされたことで、キリスト教に対する風当たりが強まっていく。このような風潮を象徴するできごとが内村鑑三の不敬事件（1891年）であった。また、政府は大逆事件(1911年)で幸徳秋水を処刑したが、キリスト教に批判的な立場から、彼の遺作である『基督抹殺論』の刊行を認めた。
このような情勢の中でも、この時期、様々なキリスト教的社会福祉事業や社会運動が起こっている。キリスト教精神がようやく日本社会に浸透し、社会への働きかけという形で実を結び始めたことの証ともいえる。

カトリック教会の動向
高等教育や出版活動において日本のカトリック教会は、プロテスタントに大きく遅れをとっていた。
明治末期になると、パリ外国宣教会による日本の独占司牧体制に無理があることは、同会の一部でも認められ、今後の教会の発展には他の修道会の来日が必要であるとの意見が出始めた。

しかし、パリ外国宣教会の内部からは、十分な内部変革の動きが無かったこともあり、日露戦争前後の時期になると、日本人の司祭や信徒の一部から「パリ外国宣教会の宣教活動は、近代国家となった日本では十分な成果を挙げ得ないもの」として、教会改革の必要性を唱える者が現れた。例えば長崎教区で教会改革を目指した司祭の平山牧民および一部の信徒らは、慈善活動を通じて下層階級への宣教事業に力を入れる同会に不満を持ち、高等教育や学術活動に強いイエズス会の誘致運動を行い、教皇庁にその必要を主張する意見の具申を行っている。また東京大司教区では、知識人層を対象にした出版活動や青年運動が展開され、パリ外国宣教会の中には日本人の若手カトリック知識人の活発な活動に期待する宣教師も存在した。
しかし、日本人信者によるパリ外国宣教会の司牧体制に向けた批判活動は、平山牧民の追放や前田事件を引き起こし、結果的にイエズス会の招致は実現したが、教会の改革運動は低調な状態に陥ってしまった。その後、1916年に岩下壮一を中心として結成された第2次公教青年会の会長に山本信次郎が就任し、再び知識人活動や青年運動が盛り上がった。

日露戦争後の1905年11月、教皇ピオ10世は、アメリカ人司教のウィリアム・ヘンリー・オコンネルを親善使節として明治天皇宛てに親書を託し派遣した。
教皇使節の日本訪問は、日露戦争時に戦地のカトリック教会が日本により保護されたことに対して、ローマ教皇が明治天皇に感謝の意を表するために行われたものだが、同時に日本のカトリック教会の現状視察という別の目的を持っていた。この訪問を機縁に、日本のカトリック教会もフランスのパリ外国宣教会の独占から多様化された。スペインよりドミニコ会、ドイツより神言会、イエズス会、フランシスコ会、カナダよりフランシスコ会、ドミニコ会、イタリアよりサレジオ会が来日した。この多様化によって教育事業においても、従来の初等中等教育から高等教育にも取組んだ。
1906年にピオ10世より「日本に高等教育機関を設置すること」の要請を受けたイエズス会は、1908年に3人のイエズス会員を派遣する。その後、1911年に財団法人上智学院を設立、1913年に専門学校令による大学（上智大学）を開校した。1916年には、聖心女子学院高等専門学校（後の聖心女子大学）が設立され、カトリックは貧民層のためという印象は薄れた。

社会福祉事業
このような流れの中でも、社会福祉事業は続けられた。
1926年、司祭のアルベール・アンリ・シャルル・ブルトン
によって神奈川県鎌倉市に結核療養所「聖テレジア療養所」が設立された。また女子教育においても1907年、司祭のルイ・ルラーブ
によって京都府宮津市に宮津裁縫伝習所が創設され、後の京都暁星高等学校へと発展する。

本所教会焼討ち事件
1905年9月5日、ロシア帝国と締結されたポーツマス条約に、日露戦争時の増税による耐乏生活を強いられてきた民衆の不満が爆発した。（日比谷焼打事件）翌9月6日23時頃、本所地区に決起した暴徒は、本所教会を襲い一帯の信者の住居と共に本所教会は焼討ちされた。暴動が鎮まった後も敵意は教会に向けられたため、当時の東京大司教であったピエール・マリー・オズーフは時勢を考え、本所教会の主任司祭を日本人に交代した。

プロテスタント教会の動向
この時期はプロテスタントにとっても困難な時期ではあったが、売買春の廃絶を目指した日本基督教婦人矯風会（1886年）の発足や、石井十次による岡山孤児院（1887年）、石井亮一の聖三一孤女学院（1891年、後の滝乃川学園）のような養護施設活動、山室軍平による救世軍運動（1895年）などキリスト教的社会福祉事業、社会運動、廃娼運動が起こっている。セツルメント運動や神戸・灘での生活協同組合（現コープこうべ）なども、キリスト教文化の影響下に生まれた運動として挙げることができる。

また、この時期、自由主義神学、高等批評が導入され、日本の教会に混乱を与えることになる。1885年にドイツ普及福音教会のウィルフリード・スピンナーが来日し、聖書は人間の宗教的な記録であると主張した。またこの派からオットー・シュミーデルも来日する。この立場は、新神学と呼ばれたが、彼ら自身は「最も進歩せる学術的キリスト神学」と称した。これは日本組合基督教会に強い影響を与えた。
1887年には大日本帝国政府司法大臣らの招聘でアメリカ・ユニテリアン協会からユニテリアンの宣教師が来日し、三位一体、キリストの神性を否定した。熊本バンドの小崎弘道はリベラルな新神学を受け入れ、1889年に同志社学院で開催されたキリスト教青年会の夏期学校で、「聖書のインスピレーション」と題して講演をした。また、1891年に金森通倫も「モーセ五書は、ユダヤ人の伝説や神話の寄せ集めである」と主張した。
1892年には日本基督教会で「日本の花嫁事件」が起こり、田村直臣牧師が免職になった。1893年に東京帝国大学の井上哲次郎教授は、『教育と宗教の衝突』を発表して内村鑑三を非難し、キリスト教と日本は相容れないとした。それに対して柏木義円は『同志社文学』第59号に「勅語と基督教」を掲載して反論した。
1897年にはドイツの普及福音教会が東京に東郷坂教会を設立し、ユニヴァーサリズムを支持する赤司繁太郎が1946年まで牧師を務めた。
1901年5月に20世紀大挙伝道の働きの中で、リバイバルが起こり、1907年にはプロテスタント人口が約6万人となった。

1901年9月から、リベラル神学を巡って、植村・海老名論争が起こる。1902年に福音同盟会は総会を開き、イエス・キリストの神性を確認し、海老名を追放したが、植村も十全霊感を否定した。やがて植村は十全霊感を重視する南長老ミッション宣教師サムエル・フルトンと対立し、明治学院教授を辞職して東京神学社を設立した。フルトンもまた明治学院との関係を断って神戸神学校を設立し、富田満や賀川豊彦らもこれに従った。
1903年には、それまで各教派別に編纂されていた讃美歌集を一つにまとめた共通『讃美歌』が作成された。
1904年の日露戦争では、海老名弾正、植村正久、井深梶之助、本多庸一が主戦論を唱え、内村鑑三、柏木義円、白石喜之介が非戦論を唱えた。トルストイの影響を受けた、キリスト教社会主義者の安部磯雄、木下尚江、西川光次郎、石川三四郎、片山潜らも無抵抗主義の非戦論だった。

1907年には救世軍の創立者ウィリアム・ブースが来日した。2万人を超える群集がブース大将を歓迎し、彼は西園寺公望、大隈重信、明治天皇に面会した。1912年に救世軍病院が開設される。

1909年10月には、日本におけるプロテスタント宣教開始50年を祝って、宣教開始50年記念会が開催された。
1910年の朝鮮併合後に朝鮮総督府（日本統治時代の朝鮮）は、日本基督教会の指導者植村正久に朝鮮宣教を持ちかけた。植村は朝鮮併合には賛成していたものの、朝鮮宣教は断ったため朝鮮総督府は、日本組合基督教会の指導者海老名弾正に朝鮮宣教を命じた。日本組合基督教会は、同年10月の第26回定期総会で全会一致をもって「朝鮮人伝道」を決議し、渡瀬常吉を派遣。日本組合基督教会は朝鮮総督府より莫大な資金援助を受けて朝鮮植民地伝道を繰り広げた。
明治（1868年-1912年）の終わりから大正（1912年-1926年）にかけて、明治後半にみられた国粋主義への傾きが一時的に退潮した。1912年の神仏基による三教会同は、ようやくキリスト教の地位が宗教界で同等なものとみなされたかのような印象を与えたが、その一方で昭和（1926年-1989年）に入ってキリスト教が国家の統制下に組み込まれていくことへの伏線となった。この時期、日本基督教会の信徒であった賀川豊彦は労働組合運動など活発に社会運動を行なったが、彼の設立した消費組合は後の生活協同組合へとつながった。

1918年には中田重治、内村鑑三、木村清松が再臨運動を展開した。1919年11月、淀橋教会の祈祷会から、ホーリネス・リバイバルが起き、四重の福音を唱えるホーリネスは教勢を拡大していった。

教育事業
1910年6月にエディンバラ宣教会議が開催され、日本からは本多庸一、井深梶之助、原田助などが出席した。この大会の決議により、東京女子大学が設立された。
1918年12月の大学令公布を受けてプロテスタント系の専門学校の間でも大学昇格運動が起こり、1920年に同志社大学、1922年に立教大学、1932年に関西学院大学が設立された。

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		

青山学院も高木壬太郎院長の下で大学昇格を目指した。しかし高木の急死（1921年）、関東大震災による校舎壊滅（1923年）などの不運も重なって、青山学院の大学昇格は戦後まで持ち越しとなった。

正教会の動向
大正以降の正教会の動向については、日露戦争・ロシア革命の影響が大きく、反露感情・反共感情の広がりと母教会（ロシア正教会）に対する共産主義政権による弾圧もあり、他教派とは歴史的に置かれた環境が異なるために独特の経緯をたどった部分が少なく無い。
昭和初期以前、明治末から既に日露戦争に代表される日露関係の悪化から、日本正教会は日本において他教派よりも一層厳しい立場に置かれていた。正教側は、正教はロシア専有の宗教ではなく世界の聖公使徒教会であると主張していたが（これは世界の正教会と共通する見解）、世間からは「露教」と誤解する向きが根強かった。1894年にギリシャ正教会のディオニシオス大主教が来日してニコライ主教とともに奉神礼を行ったことを、「正教会が蒙っていた冤罪を雪ぐべき好機会」であったと記した三井道郎の回想記の一節にも、当時の日本正教会が置かれた状況が垣間見える。

戦前戦中昭和
昭和初期には軍部が擡頭すると、軍国主義のイデオロギーとして国家神道が利用されるようになり神道以外の宗教団体への圧力が強まった。特に教育や思想の分野において国粋主義が強化されたことで西洋の宗教であるとみなされたキリスト教は苦しい立場におかれることになった。特に1931年の満洲事変勃発以降はその傾向が強まった。
1930年代後半になると、1936年における日独防共協定の締結など、ナチス・ドイツへの接近が強まっていく。当時のドイツでは、ナチズムと「アーリアン学説」の広まりを背景として、キリスト教は、ユダヤ教と同じセム系一神教(アブラハムの宗教)であることを理由として、厳しい統制を受けた。そのような時代背景において、日本におけるナチス・ドイツへの関心の高まりも、結果としてキリスト教に対する圧力を高めた。
1939年、帝国議会によって戦争遂行のため宗教団体を統制する目的で「宗教団体法案」が可決成立し、翌1940年4月1日から施行された。これによって、日本のキリスト教界において多くの団体が政府に協力した。

カトリック教会の動向
カトリック教会では、1933年から1934年にかけて奄美カトリック迫害が起こったほか、1932年には上智大生靖国神社参拝拒否事件が起こり、靖国参拝の強要に反対した学生への弾圧を受けて日本のカトリック教会は「靖国参拝は宗教活動に当たらない」との見解「第一聖省訓令」「祖国に対する信者のつとめ」を出し、以後戦争については沈黙した（ただ、司祭や信徒の中には天皇の神性を否定して逮捕された者もいる）。このように、軍国化していく日本において、社会的な迫害の対象に置かれるなど困難な社会的状況にあったため、1931年には、映画「殉教血史 日本二十六聖人」を製作公開するなど、キリスト教徒への偏見を払拭する試みが行われた。なお、1940年の登録信者数は119,324人であった。

教育事業
困難な社会的状況の中、神言会の司祭であったヨゼフ・ライネルスは、1922年2月18日に設立された名古屋知牧区の初代教区長に就任すると、宣教とともに教育の重要性を唱えた神言会の意志を受け、教育機関の設立に奔走する。1932年1月、名古屋市に南山中学校（現在の南山学園）を設立し、初代理事長および校長を務めた。

社会福祉事業
このような状勢の中でも、社会福祉事業は続けられた。パリ外国宣教会の司祭であったヨゼフ・フロジャックは、1927年、東京市中野療養所の結核患者の一人を見舞ったことを契機に療養所訪問を始めた。1929年には野方町丸山に民家を借用し、療養所から退院させられて行き場所のない患者5名を収容する。1930年には中野療養所の近くに「ベタニアの家」を建設し、患者15名を収容した。同年、女子患者のため、別に民家を借用して患者5名を収容する。1932年、今度は患者の子供を救済するため「ナザレトの家」を建設し、男児10数名を収容、さらに1933年、療養農園「ベトレヘムの園」を建設し、軽患者の男女60名を収容した。1934年、ベトレヘムの園隣接地を買収し、養護施設「東星学園」（現在のベトレヘム学園）を建設、ナザレトの家の児童33名を移し、ナザレトの家は乳児院に転換する。1936年には学園児のため、「東星尋常小学校」を開校した。
フロジャックは事業開始直後から周囲の無理解と資金難に苦しみながらも事業を維持し、戦中、戦後も多くの社会福祉施設や幼稚園・学校を設立した。ベタニアの家はその後、社会福祉法人「慈生会」へと発展し、また教育事業は東生学園へと発展した。

宗教団体の設立
1941年5月、日本のカトリック教会は、宗教団体法に従いローマ教皇直属である日本の各司教区と日本に所在する修道会をすべて統合する団体として日本天主公教教団を設立、初代統理者に東京の土井辰雄司教を選出した。

プロテスタント教会の動向
プロテスタントでは、朝鮮の長老派が神社参拝を拒んでいたため、日本政府は1938年6月末、同じ長老派系統の日本基督教会大会議長富田満を派遣して朱基徹牧師ら朝鮮の長老派を説得させるが、朱基徹らは拒んだため、殉教することになる。朝鮮の教会は、約70名の牧師が投獄、拷問に遭い50名が殉教し、2,000名の信徒が投獄され、約200の教会が閉鎖された。

1939年に成立した宗教団体法を受けて青山学院で開催された皇紀二千六百年奉祝全国基督教信徒大会の決議に基づいて、1941年にプロテスタント32教派が自発的に統合し、日本基督教団が結成された。これにともない、日本各地のプロテスタント系神学校の大半は1943年に日本東部神学校・日本西部神学校・日本女子神学校の3校に統合された。さらに1944年には男子校2校の再統合により日本基督教神学専門学校が設立された（同時に日本女子神学校も日本基督教女子神学専門学校と改称）。
このような大合同の動きに最後まで抵抗したのは同志社大学で、学徒出陣によって授業継続が困難となった状況下でも同大神学科は廃止されることなく終戦を迎えた。

この困難な時代、日本のキリスト教界において多くが国家に妥協する一方、戦争反対を表明した一部の教会、再臨信仰を咎められたホーリネス系教団、神社参拝を拒否した美濃ミッション等には徹底した弾圧が加えられ、解散に追い込まれた。ホーリネス弾圧の中で命を落とした者に小山宗祐、菅野鋭、斉藤保太郎、辻啓蔵、小出朋治（獄中での死亡順）、竹入高、池田長十郎、佐野明治（出獄後死亡）などがいる。

正教会の動向
戦時下の中で、正教徒の外交官である杉原千畝は「命のビザ」を発行し、ナチスの虐殺からユダヤ人を生命の危機からを助けた。イスラエルの回復を祈るホーリネス系のキリスト者が逃れてきたユダヤ人たちを受け入れた。旧約の神の民のうち、ある人は日本から渡米し、また再建されたイスラエルに帰還していった。
1931年、大主教ニコライの後継者であるセルギイ・チホミーロフは府主教に昇叙された。だが、共産主義政権（ソ連）の下で弾圧されその監視下にあるロシア正教会の意思・決定に忠実なセルギイに対し、亡命ロシア人や日本人信徒から様々な反発が起こった。
このような状況下で、セルギイを、その任から解き日本人を主教にするよう日本政府から圧力がかかった。日本正教会は抵抗することもなく、1940年、セルギイは引退を余儀なくされ、代わってニコライ小野帰一が主教に着座した。その後も当局の監視は続き、高齢のセルギイは1945年に特別高等警察に逮捕され拷問を受け、約1ヶ月拘留された。釈放後の同年8月10日、終戦の5日前にセルギイは死去した。拷問による衰弱死といわれている。

戦後昭和から平成前半
1945年8月に第二次世界大戦が日本の降伏と連合国の勝利により終結すると、進駐してきたGHQの指示によって国家による神社への保護（国家神道）が廃止されたことにより、キリスト教各派は自由に活動できるようになった。さらに1945年10月、宗教団体法が撤廃され宗教法人令が公布・施行されると、戦時中に統合・監督的束縛を加えられていたキリスト教各派は、一斉に組織の再編に着手すると共に、日本各地で大規模な布教を開始した。
1946年、日本国憲法によって完全な信教の自由が認められると、海外のキリスト教諸団体は活発に宣教師を派遣するようになった。さらに、かねてから準備されていた口語訳聖書も出版（新約1954年、旧約1955年）された。

カトリック教会の動向
1945年11月に全国臨時教区長会議を開催、従来の教団組織を改称し、翌12月には天主公教教区連盟を設置した。さらに1947年5月に全国教区長会議および教区連盟理事会が開かれて、今後の事業計画や活動方針を示すと共に、「教区長共同教書」が発表され、大々的に布教活動が行われた。その結果、登録信者数は1946年の108,324人から1950年には143,461人に増加し、さらに1955年には212,318人、1968年には344,343人となって戦前をはるかに凌ぐ比率で増加した。
また世界レベルでは、二つの世界大戦を防げなかったことと、戦後も冷戦構造の中で精神的な指導力を発揮できないことへの反省から、1962年以降、カトリック教会で「アジョルナメント」（現代化）を目指した公会議（第2バチカン公会議）が行われた。この会議では、カトリック教会の冷静な現状認識と今後の方向性が確認された。その中でヨーロッパ中心的な思考にとらわれすぎていたカトリック教会の姿勢が正され、もっと世界規模の視野を持って、教会のあり方を考える必要性が痛感された。
公会議のこのような精神に沿って、教会生活全体の見直しが行われたが、その一環として典礼の国語化が進められた。日本でもミサをはじめとする典礼の日本語式次第と、典礼の中で用いられる日本語聖歌（典礼聖歌）が作成された。また公会議では他宗教、特にキリスト教他教派への敬意と対話という方針がはっきりと打ち出された（「エキュメニズム」と呼ばれる宗教間対話の動きは、元々プロテスタントの中から起こったもので、1910年のエディンバラ宣教会議を嚆矢とする）。
こうしたエキュメニズムの精神にそってプロテスタント諸教派とカトリック教会の聖書学者が結集して聖書の翻訳事業が行われることになった。ここに共同訳聖書（1978年）が完成し、さらに共同訳聖書における問題点を改善して出版されたのが新共同訳聖書（1987年）である。
1981年には、史上初めてローマ教皇ヨハネ・パウロ2世が来日。東京、広島、長崎を訪れ、「平和アピール」を発表するなどした。

プロテスタント教会の動向
1956年2月にビリー・グラハムが来日し、日本における最初のビリー・グラハム伝道大会が開かれた。
1959年は、プロテスタント宣教百周年記念行事が、エキュメニカル派と福音派で別々に開かれた。エキュメニカル派では日本キリスト教協議会、日本基督教団を中心として開催された。その後1970年の大阪万博では、カトリック教会とエキュメニカル派のプロテスタントとの共同によるキリスト教館の出展があった。この頃から日本基督教団では、教会派と社会派が対立し、教団紛争と呼ばれる紛争状態に入った。

一方、福音派（聖書信仰派）は、イムマヌエル綜合伝道団の蔦田二雄、ホーリネスの車田秋次、日本キリスト改革派教会のマキルエン、常葉隆興、岡田稔、聖書キリスト教会の尾山令仁らを指導者として、1959年に日本宣教百年記念聖書信仰運動を展開し、翌年日本プロテスタント聖書信仰同盟の発足を見た。この働きが新改訳聖書（新約1965年、旧約1970年）の出版と日本福音同盟の成立（1968年）につながった。エキュメニカル派は世界教会協議会 (WCC) と交わりを持ち、福音派は世界福音同盟、ローザンヌ運動と交わりを持っている。
1974年に日本で最初の日本伝道会議が開催され、イギリスのジョン・ストットが招かれた。70年代は福音派の協力関係が結ばれ、聖書信仰の教会が教勢を伸ばした時代であり、「はばたく日本の福音派」と呼ばれている。
1999年10月末に、京都市の国立京都国際会館で「世界宣教会議」が開催され、奥山実牧師が委員長を務めた。この「世界宣教会議」は、『キリスト教年鑑』2001年版によって「日本キリスト教史上最大規模の『世界宣教会議』」と呼ばれている。

正教会の動向
西方教会諸派が戦後に日本で教勢を回復する一方で、日本正教会は戦後を迎えてもなお安定することはなかった。第二次世界大戦も他教派と同様に正教会にとり苦悩の原因であったが、それ以上の長期に亘る苦悩の原因としてソビエト連邦の存在があったためである。共産主義諸国で弾圧を受けており、経済的・人的援助はロシア正教会から行われなかったにも拘わらず、正教会は「アカ」のレッテルを貼られて各地で教勢を衰退させた。
また、日本正教会内部も、ソビエト連邦による弾圧・監視下にあるモスクワ総主教庁の意思の真正性に対する疑問から、母教会たるロシア正教会との関係をどのような形にするのかについてロシア革命直後から戦後しばらくまで様々な立場に割れた状態が続いており、これも教勢衰退の原因となった。
1970年になってモスクワ総主教庁とアメリカ正教会と日本正教会の合意が成立し、日本正教会はロシア正教会を母教会とする自治教会の祝福を得ることで、ようやく教会組織の安定を得た。
2000年5月には史上初めてモスクワ総主教アレクシイ2世が日本を訪問した（逆に言えば日本正教会はロシア正教会の子教会であるにも拘わらず、モスクワ総主教が訪日したことが歴史上実に一度も無かったことを意味する）。来日時、アレクシイ2世は日本正教会の首座主教の着座式を執り行うとともに、天皇とも会見している。また、着座式にはアメリカ正教会からも首座主教の出席があった。
混乱の時代を経ながらも、日本正教会は明治の日本語訳による奉神礼を守り続けて今日に至っている。

平成後半から令和
2008年11月24日、日本のカトリック教会は、長崎市の長崎県営野球場において「ペトロ岐部と187殉教者列福式」を挙行した。これは日本カトリック史上初めて日本で行われた列福式であった。
2009年には、日本プロテスタント宣教150周年を記念して、エキュメニカル派、福音派、聖霊派の三派の共同になる日本プロテスタント宣教150周年記念大会が開催された。
2010年5月に、エディンバラ宣教会議100周年を記念して世界宣教東京大会が開催。初日に大川従道牧師らが説教した。また閉会式で尾山令仁牧師が日本の犯した罪を謝罪し、これにこたえてアメリカ合衆国の代表が日本に原爆を投下した罪と世界に対して犯した罪を謝罪した。
2013年4月11日付のカトリック新聞オンラインに「旧日本軍に殺された司教、列福へ一歩前進」という記事が掲載された。内容は、「日中戦争中に起きた正定事件によって殺害された司教ら9人の列福運動が、オランダで進んでいる」というものだったが、この虐殺事件の真偽が問題視され、西村眞悟がブログ上で抗議するなど波紋を呼んだ。
2016年、京都府木津川市に、コプト正教会系列の聖母マリア・聖マルココプト正教会が開設された。
2019年11月23日-26日の日程で第266代ローマ教皇フランシスコが来日（1981年の第264代教皇ヨハネ・パウロ2世以来、2度目の教皇来日）。教皇来日のテーマは、「すべてのいのちを守るため〜PROTECT ALL LIFE」。フランシスコ教皇は東京都、広島県、長崎県を訪問し、東日本大震災被災者との交流、皇居での今上天皇（徳仁）との会見や総理大臣官邸での安倍晋三首相との会談、東京ドームでの5万人ミサなどを行った。

主な聖書翻訳
2003年に、新日本聖書刊行会は、差別用語を中心に改訂し、新改訳第3版を発行。そして宗教改革500年の2017年に、新改訳の大幅な改訂が実施され、新改訳2017を発行。ほとんどの節に何等かの改訂が施された。フランシスコ会聖書研究所は、2011年にそれまでバラで発行していた聖書の合冊版を発行。日本聖書協会はカトリック側と共同で新共同訳の改訂に着手し、2018年に聖書協会共同訳を発行。新改訳2017も聖書協会共同訳も初刷で改訂箇所が見つかり、それぞれ発行された翌年に改訂している。

直近のキリスト教人口
文化庁宗務課の統計『宗教年鑑　令和3年版』（2021年）によると、2020年12月31日時点で日本におけるキリスト教人口は1,915,294人で、対総人口比率は1.1%である。
ただし『宗教年鑑』は宗教法人化されていない宗教団体は含んでいないこと、逆に異端とされがちな宗派を含んでいることに注意が必要である。
『宗教統計調査 文化庁 令和2年度』によると、2019年末時点でのキリスト教人口の内訳は、カトリック教会880,277人、プロテスタント諸教派総計341,066人、日本ハリストス正教会9,468人、末日聖徒イエス・キリスト教会128,132人である。
「宗教年鑑 令和3年版」によると、都道府県別人口100人あたりのキリスト教徒数トップ5・ワースト5は下記の通りである。

34785512-6393-4327-be58-606bcd45a8f1,约曼特,https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A4%E3%82%AA%E3%83%9E%E3%83%B3%E3%83%86,イオマンテ,イオマンテ（iomante）とはアイヌの儀礼のひとつで、ヒグマなどの動物を殺してその魂であるカムイを神々の世界（kamuy mosir）に送り帰す祭りのことである。,"イオマンテ（iomante）とはアイヌの儀礼のひとつで、ヒグマなどの動物を殺してその魂であるカムイを神々の世界（kamuy mosir）に送り帰す祭りのことである。

用語・概説
イオマンテの語は、イ（i、'それを'）+オマンテ（返す）からなり、すなわち'それを送る'という意味であるが、「それ」とは恐れ多いカムイの名を直接呼ぶ事を避けた婉曲表現であり、従ってイオマンテとは「カムイを行かせる」儀式の意である。また、語頭のiとoの間に渡り音のｙが挿入されてiyomante＝イヨマンテという発音になることも多い。
近代においては単にイオマンテという場合、熊（ヒグマ）のイオマンテが主体とされる。
飼育したヒグマを対象とする儀式はイオマンテ、狩猟によって捕殺した野生のヒグマ（キムンカムイ、'山の神'）を対象とする儀式はカムイ・ホプニレ (kamuy hopunire) と呼んで区別する地域もある。「ホプニレ」とはho「尻」+puni「何々を持ち上げる」+re「使役動詞語尾」で「（カムイを）発たせる」の意味。狩猟で殺した直後の獣のカムイは、魂 (ramat) の形で両耳の間に留まっているという。そこでカムイ・ホプニレの儀式では祭壇を設えてヒグマの頭部を祀り、酒食やイナウを捧げてそのカムイに神々の世界に帰ってもらう。
本来は、カムイであればどんな（狩猟動物の）カムイでも構わなかったと推考されている。かつてアイヌが本州に居住していた頃に熊送りがおこなわれていたならば、対象はツキノワグマであったことは言うまでもない。熊以外の具体例では、シマフクロウ（コタンコロカムイ、'集落の守り神'）のイオマンテを一部の地域では重視されているが、梟送りは、カムイ・ホプニレとも呼称される。またシャチ（レプンカムイ、'沖の神'）を対象とするイオマンテもある。キムンカムイ（ヒグマ）、コタンコㇿカムイ（シマフクロウ）、レプンカムイ（シャチ）などのイオマンテで送られるカムイは、神格の高いカムイであるとみなされる。

儀式
冬の終わりに、まだ穴で冬眠しているヒグマを狩る猟を行う。冬ごもりの間に生まれた小熊がいた場合、母熊は殺すが（その際前述のカムイ・ホプニレを行う）、小熊は集落に連れ帰って育てる。最初は、人間の子供と同じように家の中で育て、赤ん坊と同様に母乳をやることもあったという。大きくなってくると屋外の丸太で組んだ檻に移すが、やはり上等の食事を与える。1年か2年ほど育てた後に、集落をあげての盛大な送り儀礼を行い、丸太の間で首を挟んでヒグマを屠殺し、解体してその肉を人々にふるまう。
式場には祭場を使う。祭壇はエムㇱ（宝刀）、弓矢、鎧、シントコなどで飾り、クルミや団子、近代ではミカンを供え、熊に酒を注ぎ与える。花矢で熊を射て「遊ばせ」、最終的に丸太で熊の首を挟むことでクマの肉体と魂を分離する。その折に一人のアイヌが天に向かって一矢を放ち、全員が一斉に叫ぶ。
宗教的には、ヒグマの姿を借りて人間の世界にやってきたカムイを一定期間大切にもてなした後、見送りの宴を行って神々の世界にお帰り頂くものと解釈している。ヒグマを屠殺して得られた肉や毛皮は、もてなしの礼としてカムイが置いて行った置き土産であり、皆でありがたく頂く。地上で大切にされた熊のカムイは、天界に帰った後も再度肉と毛皮を土産に携え、人間界を訪れる。さらに人間界の素晴らしさを伝え聞いたほかの神々も、肉や毛皮とともに人間界を訪れる。こうして村は豊猟に恵まれる。熊の再訪を願うために、人間からの土産としてイナウやトノト（濁酒）、シト（団子）を大量に捧げる。イオマンテの宴で語るユーカラは、佳境に入ったところでわざと中断する。神が続きを聞きたがり、再訪することを狙う。
類似の熊送り儀礼は、樺太周辺のニヴフなど、ユーラシア・タイガの北極圏に近い内陸狩猟民族に広く存在している。イオマンテもその一種である。
北海道におけるイオマンテの儀式は1955年に北海道知事名による通達によって「野蛮な儀式」として事実上禁止となった。2007年4月、通達を撤回している。

儀式の進行
イオマンテの起源
その起源については諸説ある。

オホーツク文化（ニヴフ）由来説
アイヌ文化期に先行する擦文文化期の遺構からは熊に関連する祭祀の痕跡が見当たらないことから、イオマンテはオホーツク文化（担い手はニヴフといわれる）からトビニタイ文化を経由してアイヌ文化が取り込んだとの見方がある。詳細はトビニタイ文化を参照のこと。

縄文文化（アイヌ）由来説
このほか、縄文時代のイノシシ祭りの対象動物がクマに置換されたとする説もある。日本におけるイノシシ利用史も参照。

映像作品
北海道大学植物園内の「北方民族資料室」に、北海道帝国大学時代に記録されたクマ送りの映像が保存されている。
1977年に、平取町二風谷において萱野茂の指導のもとに行った祭りの映像が、映像民俗学者の姫田忠義により「イヨマンテ 熊おくり」として記録されている。
1985年1月、川上地方で28年ぶりにイオマンテを実施し、「世界民族音楽大系1 北・東アジア篇」、LD 日本ビクター発行に収めている。

影響
昭和24年（1949年）、古関裕而作曲、菊田一夫作詞、歌唱伊藤久男/コロムビア合唱団による歌謡曲『イヨマンテの夜』がヒットし、広く知られるようになった。だが、歌詞、旋律ともにアイヌのイオマンテとはかけ離れている。「イヨマンテの夜」の旋律はアイヌの伝統音楽と関係のない歌謡曲調のものである。歌詞は、夜間にかがり火を焚いて儀礼を執り行うものになっているが、実際の送り儀礼は日中行う部分が多く、夜間にかがり火は焚かない。また前奏に銅鑼の音のような効果音が入り、歌詞にはアフリカの太鼓であるタムタムのような擬音が登場しているが、アイヌ音楽に銅鑼や掌で打つ太鼓は存在せず、歌の伴奏は手拍子のみである。
また、毎年10月中旬から11月末にかけ、「イオマンテの火まつり」という行事を阿寒湖温泉にて開催しているが、内容はアイヌ音楽や舞踊を中心にした演出であり、本来のイオマンテとは別物である。
漫画「がきデカ」でも、主人公のこまわり君がギャグとして披露するシーンがある。

解説
民俗学者の折口信夫は著作「琉球の宗教」の冒頭で、琉球の宗教を袋中以来の慣用によって琉球神道の名で話を進めたいと断った後、琉球神道は日本本土の神道の一つの分派、あるいはむしろ巫女教時代のおもかげを今に保存していると見る方が適当な位であると述べた。
鳥越憲三郎は『琉球宗教史の研究』の中で、琉球宗教の二大潮流をなすものは御嶽信仰と火神信仰であるとし、やがて火神（ヒヌカン）は日神（テダ）と同一視され、按司（アジ）や国王の実権の所在を表徴する役割を持つに至ったと述べている。
宮里朝光「琉球人の思想と宗教」によれば、琉球の固有宗教は、個人的な幸福を祈願するのではなく、社会及びそれを支える生活や生産について祈願し祝福するもので、社会が平和になれば個人は幸福になれると考えたのだと言う。その固有信仰は、祖霊神、祖先崇拝、火神、ニライ・カナイ、おなり神、水のセジ、万物有霊などがあるが、拝む対象の日月星辰を通して現世に益をもたらす祖霊に報本反始するものであると述べている。
このように琉球は特有の信仰を有している。以下、その固有信仰などについて解説する。

信仰の由来
琉球神道は自然発生的に生まれたと考えられている。ノロが世襲型、ユタが原始的な召命型のシャマニズムであること、御嶽は古代集落が原型と考えられ御嶽信仰は祖霊崇拝が変化したものと考えられること、またおなり神信仰は古代の母系社会や女性上位社会の変化と考えられること、これらのことから古代信仰の形式をとどめていると考えられている。

セジ
セジという言葉がある。
仲原善忠『おもろ新釈』によればセジは霊力を意味し、セジが剣につけば霊剣に、石につけば霊石となり、門、港、舟、社、城等にもつき、人についた場合は超人となると述べている。
仲松弥秀『神と村』では、『おもろ新釈』の説明を受けてさらに考察し、セジすなわち霊力とは「人間としては不可能なことを成し得る能力」を指しているであろうと述べている。そうであるなら「人間としては不可能なことを成し得る能力」は機能的に際限無く分類できるため、その能力を持つもの、即ち「神」は琉球において八百万も居るということになるであろうと述べている。

神
仲松弥秀『神と村』では、全知全能のセジの具備者なる存在を古代琉球人が考えていたか否かについては研究不十分であるが、種々の機能を各々分担したセジの保持者は想定していたと考えられると述べ、人間は自己の欲するものを顕現してくれるセジを期待するのが至極当然であろうから、琉球における神とは「人間に善をもたらすセジの顕現者」と言う観念に傾斜していくことになるだろうと述べている。
また、琉球の神は主に「来訪神」と「守護神」に分類でき、守護神や来訪神のいる異界・他界に豊穣を祈り、特に太陽神を最高神として崇める多神信仰である。来訪神は異界の神であり、平時には人々の集落に存在しないか、御嶽にのみいると考えられる。しかし祭りの時になると異界から集落や集落の御嶽に訪れると考えられており、来訪神と人間の関係は極めて近しい。特に著名な神は、琉球の創造神であるアマミキヨ（アマミク）とシネリキヨや、ニライカナイの最高神である東方大主（あがりかたうふぬし）、国王就任の際に現れるという君手摩（キミテズリ）などであるが、この他にも多数の神がいると考えられている。来訪する神は世界的に島嶼民族に共通して見られ、一般に海を神聖視するが、これは琉球においても同様である。これに関連して、折口信夫は「まれびと論」を展開した。
一方、守護神はもともと地域集落の死者の魂＝祖霊であり、ニライカナイで神となって集落に戻ってくるとされ、この神は平時に拝所や御嶽にいると考えられている。また、過去の偉大な功績を残したノロが神とされ、墓地が御嶽となる例が確認される。

御嶽
沖縄本島の村落には必ず御嶽（ウタキ）と呼ばれる聖林があり、そこには村人の保護者であり支配者である神が住み給っている。御嶽に祀られる神は、その村落の構成員と血縁関係を持つ氏祖で、村落構成員に対し絶対的守護の義務を負っている。
御嶽は日本本土に見られる神社の原初的形態である神籬の形式を伝えるものである。鳥越憲三郎は、琉球の村落成立の重要な因子として、生活資料が確保できるかの経済的条件、気候や住環境の良し悪しの自然的条件、御嶽を創立する場所が選定できるか否かの宗教的条件の3つをあげ、村落成立にはこの3つが満たされる必要があったと述べている。
（詳しくは御嶽 (沖縄)参照）

ヲナリ神
沖縄本島の女性一般は全て巫女的ないし神的素質を生得的・本有的に持つものと信じられているが、その好例がヲナリ神信仰である。「ヲナリ」とは沖縄方言で姉妹（ウナイ）を意味し、同胞の姉妹は、その兄弟（ヰキガ）の守護神であると信じられている。従って沖縄本島の全女性は兄弟を持つ限りにおいてヲナリ神となるわけである。ヲナリ神の信仰は琉球宗教の基本概念の1つとなっており、『おもろさうし』の中にもヲナリ神を詠ったおもろが数多く見られる。沖縄本島においては、政治的実権者とその姉妹から選ばれた巫女による祭政一致の政教二重主権が見られるが、これはヲナリ神の信仰に基礎付けられたものである。鳥越憲三郎は、ヲナリ神信仰は他の民族では既に見られなくなったが、古くは何れの民族もかかる信仰を持っていたのではなかろうか、と述べている。
（詳しくはおなり神参照）

巫女
沖縄本島の民間社会において、民衆の宗教的機能を担う職能者は、女性司祭者のノロ等の神人（カミンチュ）と、シャーマンとしてのユタ等の類に分かれる。前者が主として御嶽やグスク等の聖地・御願所・拝所（ウガンジュ）において村落の公的祭祀や共同体の祈願行事の司祭をするのに対し、後者は村落の個々の家や家族に関する私的な呪術信仰的領域に関与している。桜井徳太郎は、この両者とも沖縄民間信仰の底辺を貫流するシャマニズムの根の上に立ち、沖縄の民間信仰を支える車の両輪と言えると述べている。
堀一郎は、シャーマニズムとシャーマンの概念は学者によって異なる定義づけがなされ、諸学者間に一致した見解は現状もたれていないと述べ、桜井徳太郎もこれと同様のことを述べている。しかしまた桜井徳太郎は、シャーマンになるための入巫動機が、生計を立てるためとか世襲継承の原理に基づくとかにあるのではなく、心身異常の巫病に罹り、苦悩のすえ神霊の召命を受けてそれを克服し、ついにシャーマンへと成巫するという過程が最も自然なシャーマン的プロセスであるとするなら、沖縄シャーマンの成巫過程はその典型的タイプであると述べている。

ノロ
前述のとおり、沖縄本島には御嶽などにおいて部落や村落の公的祭祀や共同体の祈願行事の司祭をおこなう祝女（ノロ）と呼ばれる女神官が存在する。
御嶽の節で述べたように、村落は守護神となる氏祖が祀られた御嶽を中心に形成されたが、その最も近き血縁者にして神の代弁者である家が根所（ニードゥクル）と呼ばれ、村を支配指導する実権を掌握した。根所は御嶽の神の代弁者として実権を代行する機関となったため、神託を受ける者と、その神託によって村を治める者が必要になった。この時、神託を受けたのは根所の女子から選ばれた根神（ニーガン）で、神託をもとに政治的実権を行使したのは根神の兄弟であり根所の戸主である根人（ニーチュ）であった。ここに妹（或は姉）の神託をもとに兄（或は弟）が治める政教二重主権が生まれた。この政教二重主権はヲナリ神信仰を基定として成立したと考えられる。
やがて村々を併合した按司と呼ばれる地方的実権者が現れるようになるが、按司もまた彼の姉妹から宗教的実権者たる巫女を選出した。これが祝女（ノロ）である。あるいは尊称を付してノロクモイと呼ばれた。しかし、さらに時代が進むと地方実権者の1つである中山国により琉球統一がおこなわれ、その中央集権化政策によってノロは聞得大君を頂点とした官僚的神官組織に組み込まれることとなる。この聞得大君も王の姉妹から選ばれ、統一王国においても兄妹による政教二重主権がおこなわれた。
ノロや根神など神人は、神が降臨する聖地の御嶽で神懸りしながら神意を霊感し、それを地域社会の住民に伝達した。鳥越憲三郎は、琉球において巫女は神の顕現として、具象的な神の姿において民衆の前に現れ、しかもその時は自他ともに神そのものと認める存在として託宣を聞いたと述べている。すなわち神が憑依した者としての巫女に先行して、神そのものとしての巫女が存在しており、琉球の多くの文献に見られる神々の出現は、神そのものとしての巫女を指してるのだとしている。
（詳しくはノロ参照）

ユタ
もっぱら死霊の憑依を受けてトランスに入り、第一人称でその託宣を述べるものを一般に口寄せ巫女と称するが、南西諸島において口寄せ巫女としての巫儀を展開している呪術宗教職能者がユタ等と呼ばれ、前述のとおり部落や村落の個々の家や家族に関する私的な呪術信仰的領域に関与している。ユタになったものは必ず原因不明の病気が随伴するカミダーリィと呼ばれる状態を通過体験しなければならない。このカミダーリィは、巫病の性格・内容を典型的に備えたものである。カミダーリィとなった者は悩み悩んだ末、ついにユタに運命判断（ハンジ）を求め、ユタになる道順の手ほどきを受けるうち成巫する。ユタという職能者の成立については、伊波普猷、桜井徳太郎、佐々木宏幹などが説を唱えているが、ノロなど神人（カミンチュ）から分化したという考えが多いようである。
（詳しくはユタ参照）

沖縄本島の祖霊信仰
沖縄本島は祖先崇拝の盛んな土地として知られている。また、御嶽の節にあるとおり、氏祖は村落の守護神とされる。

桜井徳太郎は沖縄本島独特の他界観念として後生（グソー）観をあげ、その一例として久高島の後生観を取り上げている。それによれば、久高島では墓地の入口を新後生（ミーグソー）と称して、そこを生界と死界との境界だとし、7年後の洗骨が終わると死者は真の後生へ赴いて神へ昇化すると久しく観念していた。新後生においては、死者は生前と同じ生活様式をとると考えられているため、新後生の墓廓は現世の家屋と同じ形態を備えている。鳥越憲三郎は沖縄人の墓造りに関し、死後の生活に対する明るい観念が墓造りに対する悦びの感情を抱かせていると推察し、死後も出来るだけ居心地の良い住家でありたいという念願から私財のほとんどを惜しげなく投じて墓を造るのだと述べている。墓造りに多額の費用を投じることに関しては、桜井徳太郎も1970年頃の沖縄本島北東部の調査の際、部落の人々が豪壮で大規模な墓造りを競っている傾向を報告している。王族や士族の亀甲墓は17世紀後半から主として本島で普及する。最古のものは護佐丸の墓（1686年）や伊江御殿墓（1687年）など。現在、沖縄本島における葬制は火葬となっているが、太平洋戦争前には伝染病患者の死などの特別な場合を除き土葬がおこなわれていた。また、伊波普猷の報告にあるとおり、明治時代までは風葬がおこなわれていた。風葬は明治時代に行政から禁止されたが、久高島では1960年代まで行われていたことが確認されている。 また風葬に近い葬法では、1970年代まで宮古島で洞穴葬がおこなわれていた。
風葬において遺体はまず崖（パンタ）や洞窟（ガマ）に置かれて自然の腐敗を待ち、3年後・5年後・7年後など適当な時期を見て洗骨して納骨する。日本本土では薄葬令（646年）により庶民も定まった墓地に葬むる慣習が定着したのに比して、琉球弧において崖や洞窟（ガマ）は古来、現世と後生の境界の世界とされ、聖域であると同時に忌むものとされてきた。祖霊を崇める一方で、「死」はあくまで「穢れ」と捉えられているのである。
また折口信夫「琉球の宗教」によれば、琉球では自分の祖先でも死後七代目には必ず神になると信じられていたと述べ、『中山世鑑』ではこれを「七世生神（しちせいしょうしん）」と書いたと紹介している。さらに「琉球の宗教」によれば、琉球では人が死ぬと屍体を洞窟の中に投げ込んで、その口を石で固めてその隙間を塗りこむ風習があったが、七代経つと屍体を入れるのをやめて別の場所に新墓所を設け、それまで屍体を入れていた洞窟を「神墓（くりばか）」と称する。「神墓」は「拝所（をがん）」となり、時代を経るに従って他の人々も拝するようになる、と琉球では祖霊が神になることを紹介している。
死生観として、魂は神のいる異界ニライカナイ（後述）より来て、死んでまたそこへ帰り、守護神となって集落へ還ってくると考える。このため祖霊を非常に敬い、死後の世界を後生（グソー）と称して、これも非常に現世や生者と近しいものとしてとらえている。また、琉球における仏教の影響から旧暦8月には祖霊が集落、家族のもとへ帰ってくるという、お盆の祭事を行う。なお、祭事の日取りは旧暦を用いる。

他界概念
琉球神道では、神がいる他界概念としてニライカナイとオボツカグラを想定する。ニライカナイは海の彼方、あるいは地底にあると考えられ、そこは豊穣と命の根源となる異界である。ニライカナイ信仰は東方信仰と混交して、東方にあると考えられるようになった。一方、オボツカグラは天空にあると考えられる異界である。もともとは国頭地方の信仰と考えられ、琉球王国時代に喧伝されて、宗教支配の為の王権神授論的な権威付けに用いられた。まとめると、ニライカナイは水平線上の庶民的な、オボツカグラは垂直にある権威的な他界といえる。ちなみに西方は魔界があるとされている。

教義と経典
指針はノロを介して神より与えられる。人々はただ、定められた時期に必要な祭りを行い、訪れる神と交流するのである。

琉球王国における体系化と東方信仰
琉球王国は祭政一致の政策を敷き、各地の類似信仰を吸収、弾圧、廃止などを行い整理統制化した。各地に様々な呼び方をされていた聖域を「御嶽」という呼称に変え、ノロは階級化され、集落のノロが各集落の御嶽を管理し、地方の豪族領主である按司の血縁の女性をその地域全体のノロを統括する大阿母（神職名）とし、さらに国王の血縁の女性をノロの頂点である聞得大君とした。
また、琉球王国は太陽神（てぃだ）を最高神とする東方信仰を根幹においた。そして琉球国王は太陽に重ねて称えられ、ニライカナイの君手摩神の祝福を受け、オボツカグラの認証を持つとされて、王権神授論を構成した。
東方には太陽が昇る穴（太陽が穴：てぃだがあな）があると考えられ、その先は神域と考えられた。すなわち東方は太陽のある聖域であり、反対に西方は死の領域と考えられ、忌避された。王国時代の風葬は西方の崖や洞窟で行われた。首里からみて、太陽が登ってくる地平線の真下にある玉城村など四間切は聖地と考えられ、多くの御嶽が集中している。またさらに東方の海に浮かぶ久高島は琉球王国最高の聖地と考えられ、久高島の中央にあるクボー御嶽は太陽が穴そのものとされていた。以来、久高島は現在に至るまで沖縄最高の聖地として知られている。
また、琉球王国時代には、琉球開闢神話が史書として残された。『中山世鑑』や『琉球神道記』などに、日本（大和）の開闢神話と酷似した神話が記録されている。開闢神話において、琉球は天帝（日の大神、太陽神）によってアマミキヨ、シネリキヨの二柱の神によって土地を造成され、島となり、それから琉球開闢七御嶽をつくり、島に人間を放ったとされている。
琉球王国では、その王統が伊平屋・伊是名島に由来することから、伊平屋・伊是名の神を王国の守護神として王府首里に勧請した形跡がうかがえる。一例として、国王巡礼の守護神となっていた有名な園比屋武御嶽の神が、元々は伊平屋の神であったことがあげられる。また、聞得大君の神名である「しませんこ あけしの」は、もともと国頭地方勢理客の御嶽の神名であることがわかっている。

先島の信仰
また、琉球王国は先島を勢力下に収めるたびに、この信仰をその地に広め、現地にノロや司（つかさ：八重山のノロ職名）を置いている。しかし基本的に間接統治であったため、現地の信仰の多くもそのままに残され、御嶽のような形式がその地域の信仰に取り込まれていくこととなった。ただし、王国と敵対したオヤケアカハチが信仰していた八重山地方のイリキヤアマリ神信仰のように、王府により禁制された信仰も存在する。
先島諸島における主なものとしては、宮古島大神島の大神御嶽を中心に行われる「祖神祭（ウヤガン）」、同じく島尻で行われる「パーントゥ・プナハ」、八重山全域でみられる「アカマタ・クロマタ」、石垣島群星御嶽で行われる「マユンガナシ」などがあげられる。いずれも秘祭として部外者禁制を敷いているものが多い。

奄美の信仰
ウナリ神信仰を基盤とした祭政一致社会が古奄美に見られる。奄美群島の島々は平家ゆかりの神社など平家伝説が残っており、平家を祀る神社が多く建立されているが、琉球の源為朝伝説と同様に史実かどうかは定かで無い。「奄美世」においては史料に乏しく、その実態は各史料や伝説に基づく推測の域を出ず、不詳である。
史料で確認できるのは琉球勢力が奄美に及び始めた14世紀以降である。奄美群島南部の沖永良部島と与論島は、14世紀に沖縄本島北部に存在した北山王国の勢力下にあった。この頃（北山世主）から文化や信仰面においても奄美群島（特に南部）と北山の関係は深かったと考えられる。北山の勢力圏では既にノロ制度の原型が見られていた。1416年に北山王国が中山王府に滅ぼされて以降は中山の支配下（「那覇世」）に入った。
那覇世の15 - 16世紀頃、奄美群島北部にも中山王府による征服と支配体制の普請があり、それに伴い御嶽信仰やノロ制度も入ったと見られる。また琉球王国支配下の沖縄諸島、先島諸島ほどに統制は厳しくなく、ユタなどの影響も近世まで色濃く残っていた。
薩摩藩の琉球侵攻により奄美群島の実効支配を喪失（「大和世」）すると、大和の神仏習合的宗教が本格的に流入した。薩摩はキリスト教と浄土真宗（一向宗）以外は弾圧しなかったため、奄美在地の宗教は神仏習合と、従前のノロ、ユタ信仰が混淆したものとなっていた。
葬制は琉球と同様に洞窟での風葬が主体であった。亀甲墓はわずかに見られる。大和世以降は土葬が中心となった一方、遺骸を掘り起こして洗骨し改葬すると言う琉球・沖縄的な慣習も昭和まで残っていた。本土では既に稀な土葬も奄美地方では20世紀末まで残った。
現在でもノロが祭祀を取り仕切る地域がいくつかみられるが、全体的にノロとその祭祀は廃れつつある。

日本神道との類似性
伊波普猷は、明治37年（1904年）に発表し昭和17年（1942年）に改稿した「琉球の神話」の中で、『中山世鑑』の起源神話と『古事記』の淤能碁呂島神話、『宮古島旧記』の神婚説話と三輪山神話などの類似を指摘し、琉球群島にはこれら以外にも色々な神話伝説があり神話の宝庫であることから、広義の琉球群島には未だ世に知られていない無数の神話伝説があり、これらの神話伝説を悉く集めて日本本土の神話伝説と比較研究を始め、更に進んで朝鮮、満州、蒙古と比較研究をすることは、ただ神話学者にとって必要なだけでなく、人種学者にとっても必要なことであると説き、ポリネシア群島の人種移動の問題はこのような研究によって解決されたのだと指摘した。
昭和6年（1931年）松本信廣は『日本神話の研究』の中で、ローランド・ディクソン（Roland B. Dixon）がポリネシアを分類するために設定した2つの型「進化型」と「創造型」を用い、日本開闢神話をポリネシア創世神話の「進化型」と「創造型」の複合形であり、イザナギ・イザナミ神話から以降は「創造型」の形式を受け継いでいるものではないかとの説を発表した。このとき松本信廣はポリネシアと日本神話を直接比較するのではなく、中間に琉球の古伝説を置くとこの関係がいっそう明白になると述べ、「琉球民族が古く日本民族と袖を分かったもの」である以上、琉球の古神話がイザナギ・イザナミ神話の一異体であり、日本神話が琉球のそれを中間において、遠く南方の創造型神話と一脈の関連を持っていることを否み得ないとの考えを示した。
伊藤幹治は、伊波普猷が「琉球の神話」でその必要性を説いて後、『日本神話の研究』で松本信廣が日本神話と汎太平洋神話を比較するまで日琉神話の比較は途絶えていたが、『日本神話の研究』で提示された仮説は、その後多くの人に受け入れられ、こんにち日本の比較民族学上の定説になっていると述べている。さらに、岡正雄がおこなった日本の宇宙開闢神話に対する分類は、日琉神話の問題を直接取り上げた訳ではなかったが日本神話の出自＝系譜に関する歴史民族学的な研究を活発化し、日琉双方の神話比較やその文化史的位置づけ作業も徐々に行われるようになったと、その影響を紹介している。
岡正雄が提起した日本の宇宙開闢神話についての仮説は、その後、大林太良によって具体的展開を見ることになるが、伊藤幹治によれば日琉神話の比較が積極的におこなわれるようになったのは、この大林太良の研究によってである。
昭和41年（1966年）発表された「記紀の神話と南西諸島の伝承」において、大林太良は日本の古典神話と奄美や沖縄の島々に伝承されている民間説話について、流れ島、天降る始祖、死体化生、海幸彦に関する伝承神話を比較検討し、次のことを結論として述べている。

記紀に記された古典神話に親縁の諸モチーフは、わが国における現存あるいは比較的近い過去の伝承としては、ことに南西諸島に残存している。
これら南西諸島の伝承は、その基本的なモチーフ、構造においては記紀の神話と大幅な一致を見せるが、神名その他の細部においては一致していない。このことは古典神話、現存の記紀の形にまとめられてから南西諸島に二次的に伝播した可能性よりもむしろ、記紀にまとめられる前の共通の母胎から分れて、南西諸島において保存された可能性が大きいことを示唆している。
もしもこの想定が正しければ、記紀の所伝と南西諸島の伝承の比較によって、記紀以前の日本神話の古い形を再構成する可能性がある。
その際注目すべきことは、南西諸島の伝承は、国土創成、人類創造、農耕の起源の3つの主要問題を、一つづきのものとして取りあつかっていることで、構成的にも、記紀の神話よりも一貫しているのみならず、日本神話と深い親縁関係をもつと信ぜられるポリネシアなどの神話との比較から考えても、南西諸島の伝承がより古い形を保存している可能性を考慮すべきである。
この一連の開闢神話に含まれない若干のエピソード、たとえばオオゲツヒメ・モチーフや海幸彦・山幸彦モチーフも南西諸島に現存している。
古典神話と後代あるいは現存の伝承との組織的比較はまだ極めて不十分な段階にある。上記およびその他の諸問題をより明確に答えるためにも、一層組織的な材料の収集と比較が必要である。
伊藤幹治は、大林太良の試みを、伊波普猷以降ながい間とだえていた日琉神話の比較という作業の再出発と評価し、その後、山下欣一などの努力によって、琉球神話の資料の収集と整理が着々と進められ、日琉神話の比較研究の基礎がようやく固まってきたと述べている。
また、伊藤幹治自身も「日本神話と琉球神話」の中で日琉の世界と人間の起源神話および穀物起源神話を取り上げ、そのモチーフを比較検討した結果、漂える国（島）や天界出自の原祖、ヒルコ、穂落としなどのモチーフは双方の神話中に共通して認められ、日琉神話の親縁関係を示唆していると指摘する一方で、風による妊娠、原祖の地中からの出現、原祖の漂着、犬祖などは琉球神話にしか見られず、また穀物神話の死体化生モチーフは日本神話にしか見られないことなどは、双方の神話の出自＝系統が必ずしも一様でないことを物語っていると述べている。さらに続けて、こうした一致や不一致が、どうして生じているのかと言うことは、日琉神話研究の将来の課題になるだろうと指摘している。
他にも日本神道との類似性については、以下の様なものが唱えられている。
柳田國男は昭和30年（1955年）に発表した「根の国の話」において、『万葉集』に詠われた亡くなった人に逢える場所「ミミラク」の地名の考証をおこない、その中で①ニルヤ・カナヤが『日本書紀』の「神代巻」に出てくる根の国と根本が一つの言葉であり信仰である、②それが海上の故郷であるが故に、単に現世において健闘した人々のために安らかな休息の地を約束するばかりでなく、なお種々の厚意と声援とを送り届けようとする精霊が止住し往来する拠点であると昔の人たちは信じていたらしい、③その恩恵の永続を確かめんがために、毎年心を籠め身を浄くして、稲という作物の栽培を繰り返し、その成果をもって人生の目盛りとする古来の習わしがあった、という3つの仮定を説いた。
遠藤庄治は、「琉球の宗教儀礼と日本神話」の中で宮古列島の来間島豊年祭の由来譚が日光感精による処女懐胎であることを説明し、『日本書紀』神代巻冒頭の天地が分かれる以前は鶏子のごとくであったとする条と天日槍伝承に見られる卵生を思わせるモチーフが、来間島では豊年祭の由来として現在も語り継がれ、さらに祭りの催行も由来譚に登場する兄弟の家筋のものが司っていることを紹介して、沖縄においては記紀神話に語られる様々なことがらが現在も宗教儀礼の中で実修され、さらに宗教儀礼に関する神歌や口誦伝承もいまだに伝承されていると述べている。

概要
古来、イスラム世界において、日本は「ワクワク（アラビア語: الواق واق, 英語: al-Wāqwāq、諸説あるが、倭国の中国語発音が由来とされる）」として知られていた。
歴史的には、奈良時代にイスラム圏から玻璃器などの宝物が、シルクロードを通り、中国などを経由して日本にもたらされ、正倉院に保管されている。また、江戸時代にはオランダなどのヨーロッパからの情報として、イスラム圏に関する断片的な情報が日本にもたらされた。安土桃山時代には、中国やアラブからイスラム商人が訪日していたとも言われており、南蛮貿易などで東南アジアに渡った日本人商人の中には、イスラム教に改宗した者もいたとされる。
日本に最初に入ってきたムスリム集団は、1917年のロシア革命によって国を追われた中央アジアのタタール人たちである。第二次世界大戦では、日本はインドネシアやマレーシアなどのイスラム教徒が多数を占める地域を占領、3年程度であるが、軍を主体とする占領統治を行った。明治以降は、多くの日本人が移民として世界各国に渡る時期でもあり、その中には谷豊などのように、マレーシアなどのイスラム教の勢力が大きい国に移住し、イスラム教に親しむ日本人もいた。ジッダにあったイギリス公使館から本国に宛てた報告には、1938年に7人の日本人が巡礼に来たとの記録が残っている。記録に残る限り、日本人で初めての改宗者は山田寅次郎、あるいは1891年（明治24年）の野田正太郎が最初とされる。
2010年現在の日本に住むムスリムは、1980年（昭和55年頃）から1990年代にかけてパキスタンやバングラデシュ、イランなど、東南アジアや中東から労働者として来日した者と、その家族の日本人配偶者（具体的な分類としてムスリム男性と国際結婚した日本人配偶者の女性及びインドネシア人女性の配偶者の日本人男性を含む）が中心となっている。

規模
日本の行政では、宗教ごとの信者数は重視されておらず、これを詳しく調べた公的な統計は全くない。文部科学省の宗教統計調査である宗教年鑑というものはあるが、これは宗教団体の自己申告をまとめただけの大まかな調査であり、その裏付けもほぼ行われていない。神道と仏教の信者数の合計だけで、日本の総人口を遥かに上回る2億近くになり、イスラム教に至っては天理教や円応教など、全く関わりない新宗教と同じ「諸教」としてまとめられているため、イスラム教単独での信者数を数えるのは困難である。
文化庁が取りまとめた「宗務時報 No119」によれば、歴史上のムスリム人口は、1931年 - 1945年の戦中期の滞日ムスリム人口は500人から700としている。他、1953年に日本人ムスリムによって結成された日本ムスリム協会の創立時会員数は47名、1969年の外国人ムスリム人口は約1500人、1984年の滞日ムスリム人口は、約8000人という数字を上げている。「宗務時報 No119」では、2010年末の滞日ムスリム人口は約11万人としている。ピュー・リサーチ・センターの調査では、2010年の滞日ムスリム人口は、約18万5千としている。
日本人ムスリムについても、700人程度とする調査から、2000人程度、最大で7万人という数字もあるなど、非常に開きがある。日本人ムスリムは、8割近くが外国人ムスリムとの結婚により改宗した者とされる。
日本のイスラム教徒は大半が外国人によって占められているのが特徴である。日本国内に滞在する外国人のうち、イスラム教徒が一定の割合を占める国の出身者として多いのがインドネシア人（約2万5000人）、バングラデシュ人（約1万1000人）、パキスタン人（約8800人）、イラン人（約5200人）、トルコ人（約2200人）、エジプト人（約1300人）、スリランカ人（1000人以上）、マレーシア人（4000人以下）、中国人（約4200人、回族約3500人、ウイグル族約700人）などである。
イスラム教徒が大多数を占める国家からの訪日者の場合、その大半がムスリムであると推測しうるが、イスラム教徒の比率が低い国、または少数派の国からの訪日者の場合、それに占めるムスリム比率を推測するのは困難である。

日本のイスラム社会の特徴
日本以外の、アジアの非イスラム教国の多くは、国内に自国民のイスラム教徒の集団を抱えている。東南アジアやインドではイスラム王朝の支配を経験したこともあるため、当時の支配層や商人の子孫が現地人と混血、同化した形でイスラム教徒として社会の一部を形成している例もある。
台湾に関しても、中国大陸から移住した回族によるイスラム教コミュニティが存在している。しかし、日本列島は直接イスラム圏と接しておらず、イスラム王朝からの支配を受けたことも無かったため、自国民のイスラム教徒は極めて少数である。
日本のイスラム教徒の大半は外国人であるため、選挙権を持つ者は非常に少ない。そのためイスラム教徒の移民を多く抱える西欧各国とは異なり、イスラム教徒による社会問題や政治活動等は日本国内において大きな問題とはなっていない。
現在、日本国内で行われる、イスラム教徒の礼拝や集会における説教は日本語ではほとんど行われることがない。英語、もしくは、ウルドゥー語、タミル語、インドネシア語、トルコ語などのイスラム教徒の出身国の使用言語がそのまま使用されている。クルアーンに則り、知識層ではアラビア語もよく使われる。
2013年7月より、日本は東南アジア諸国のビザを緩和したため、訪日外国人旅行客が急増している。ムスリムの多いマレーシアやインドネシアからの観光客も増えているが、日本国内にはまだムスリムの生活に適合した施設が少ないため、観光客に不便を強いることがある。これら外国人に対応するため、ムスリムやイスラム教に関する勉強会が各地で開かれるようになっている。イスラム式の礼拝堂の設置も増えてきている。イスラム教徒の留学生も増えており、一部の大学ではハラールに適合したメニューを学生食堂に加えたり、礼拝の場を設けるなどの対策を行っている。全国大学生協連合会によると、2014年時点で、少なくとも日本の19の大学で、ハラール食が提供されているという。
日本に定住するムスリムが増加しイスラム教徒用墓地が不足しているという問題が出てきた。
2010年にイスラム教の埋葬工法として衛生的かつ埋葬時の安全性のあるコンクリート構造の埋葬システムを勝澤洋が考案し日本で初めて清水霊園イスラーム墓地で施工したとされる。
2023年現在、日本のイスラム教霊園は10ヶ所ほどしかないため日本に住むイスラム教徒の悩みでもある。

在日ムスリムの出身国
イスラム教徒の比率が高い国の出身者
これらの国からの訪日者は、その全てがムスリムであるとは言い切れないが、本国におけるムスリム比率が圧倒的多数であるため、おおよそ、訪日者の年齢、性別、出身地、訪日目的などを問わず、ムスリムであると推測しうる。

ムスリムの比率が比較的低い国の出身者
これらの国は、ムスリムが多数派の国家ではあるものの、本国内のムスリム比率が低いため、訪日者の、年齢や、性別、出身地、訪日目的などによっては、ムスリムではない可能性がある。

その他、ムスリムが少数派の国の出身者
これらの国は、本国内ではムスリムは少数派であるが、訪日者の日本国内のイスラム社会に占める位置が比較的大きいことから、いくつかの国家を取り上げる。

概説
カルト（英: cult）に代わる中立的な用語として使用されるようになった「new religious movement」を、日本では新宗教と呼ぶ。アメリカ合衆国では、「19世紀（1801年 - 1900年）に基礎を確立した宗教」を指す場合が多く、ヨーロッパでは「1960年代以降に発展した宗教」を新宗教とよんでいる。ただし、歴史的、宗教的背景の相違から、意味内容や対象とする年代に若干のずれがある。
日本の宗教学では、近現代（近代・現代）に誕生した宗教を指す価値中立的な用語として新宗教を用いている。正確な範囲は論者によって異なるが（特に幕末に成立した黒住教・天理教・金光教）、日本では19世紀中頃の幕末・明治維新期以降に成立した宗教のうち、既成の宗教組織を継承していないもの、また新たな教義を掲げて伝統宗教から自立したものを新宗教と呼ぶ。
学問上の便宜的な用語であり、日蓮正宗の在家信者団体というルーツから新宗教であることを否定する創価学会、天台宗との伝統を強調し新宗教ではないとする孝道教団、新宗教ではなく一切の宗教と科学を包容した超宗教であると主張する生長の家のように、教団自体が自らを新宗教とは位置付けてはいないことも多い。
宗教学者が用いる新宗教という言葉には、とりわけ「近代化」という時代背景が考慮されている。都市化、産業化、家族形態の変化、マスメディアの登場、交通の発達、学校教育の普及といった近代化によって、初めて可能となった教団の組織形態、布教形態を有する点が特徴的とされ、新宗教は近代以前に生まれた各時代における「新しい宗教」とは、それらの点で異なると見られている。

歴史
第二次世界大戦以前の日本においては、仏教宗派、キリスト教、教派神道が「公認宗教団体」とされ、文部省宗務局（現在の文部科学省、文化庁文化部宗務課に相当）の管轄であったのに対し、新宗教は「類似宗教」として、内務省警保局（現在の警察庁に相当）の管轄であった。
新宗教は、いわゆる国家神道体制下で「新興類似宗教団体」、「疑似宗教」等と呼ばれて淫祠邪教視され、警察の取り締まりの対象とされていた。新宗教への弾圧を繰り返した政府は、その都度、ラジオ・新聞・出版などマスメディアを使って大々的な邪教キャンペーンを展開して弾圧を正当化した。これらの宣伝が、国民の新宗教への邪教視、低俗視を抜きがたいものにしている。
日中戦争の最中にあった1940年（昭和15年）4月、当時の米内内閣（海軍大将）下で「宗教団体法」が成立・施行されると、新宗教は宗教結社として初めて宗教行政の対象となった。一方で、戦時体制により政府による宗教統制はさらに厳しいものとなり、戦争推進協力に積極的であった生長の家、霊友会等の一部の新宗教を除いた大半の新宗教は、ほとんど活動の余地を奪われて、逼塞状態となった。新宗教が初めて活動の自由を獲得したの戦後（第二次世界大戦敗戦後）である。
明治 - 大正時代は、新宗教の勢力は小規模なものであった。現在の新宗教の大教団では、昭和初期以後、1930年（昭和5年）に創価学会（発足当時の名称：創価教育学会）と霊友会、1938年（昭和13年）に立正佼成会が創立され、戦後から1970年（昭和45年）頃までに急成長を遂げた。
戦前においては、新宗教や新興宗教という言葉は使われることがなかったわけではないが、一部にとどまり一般化はしなかった。そうした新しい宗教に対して用いられていたのが、邪教というイメージを伴う「類似宗教」と呼ばれていた。戦後の1950年代から60年代にかけて、新しい宗教団体の活動が活発化、爆発的な拡大を始め、「新興宗教」という言葉が一般に広く使われるようになった。1970年代半ば以降、新興宗教という表現には蔑視するニュアンスがあるとして、新宗教という表現が研究者やジャーナリストの間で一般化した。

特に、1970年代以降に台頭してきた宗教を新新宗教（新々宗教）と呼ぶ学者もいる。これは宗教社会学者の西山茂、宗教ジャーナリストの室生忠などが提唱した概念で、既存の教勢が停滞する一方で、幸福の科学、世界平和統一家庭連合（旧・世界基督教統一神霊協会）、オウム真理教などが急速に拡大した現象に注目したものである。しかし新新宗教については、研究者によって多種多様な提唱があり、具体的にどの団体を指すのかも、何をもって新しいとするかの具体的基準も、明確に定まってはいない。どこまでを新新宗教に含めるか、他の新宗教と区別する意義は何か、といった議論があり、広辞苑や大辞泉にも独立単語として掲載されていない。
世界的に経済成長が止まると宗教活動が低下することが多く、日本では平成時代を経て多くの教団が大幅に信者数を減らしたとされる。

形態
発生
ひとつの典型的な形態としては、ある人物の天啓や神がかりにより運動が創始され、既存の伝統的な宗教から影響を受けつつ、新たな宗教としての体裁をなし、組織的教団となっていく例があげられる。または、宗教的修行者のもとに病気治療や人生相談を要求する人々が集結し、組織が拡大して教祖的な位置に至る場合もある。通常は、霊能祈祷師的人物の周りに定期的にお祓いなどを求める信者が集まっているだけでは、新宗教とは呼ばれない。この集団が教義を次第に整え、多くの人に布教を始め、近代的組織ができてくると、新宗教とみなされるようになる。
新宗教の教祖の経歴は非常に多様であり、宗教家をもつ家庭環境に誕生し育った者よりも、様々な社会階層、職業の者が宗教的回心によって教祖になる例が圧倒的に多い。信者たちにとって教祖は、尊敬されつつも、一般に考えられているよりは比較的身近で親しみの持てる存在として受け止められている。その一つとして、伝統宗教がその創始において教祖が家族を俗として否定したのに対し、多くの新宗教では教祖は家族を否定せず、家族関係を保持したまま家ぐるみで聖化されるストーリーを提示している。他方で、既成宗教の再生運動とみられるもの、あるいは道徳・倫理・修養団体とさほど違いのないような運動・教団も数多く存在する。

活動
新宗教は伝統宗教と比較すると、難しい教学をさほど重視せず、実生活に即した分かりやすい説明を大事としていることが多い。伝統的な神仏等を崇拝対象としつつも、事実上は教祖や指導者が崇拝（個人崇拝）されており、伝統宗教の教えを踏まえた上で、教祖や指導者による独自の教えが付け加えられている。
また、布教方法は伝統宗教と大きく異なり、伝統宗教では基本的に地縁・血縁による単純再生産がなされるのに対し、新宗教では積極的に布教を実施しない姿勢の教団も少数あるが、布教師だけでなく一般信者も布教に尽力する教団が多く、新たな信者獲得に努める姿勢が見られる（折伏大行進など）。伝統宗教が年中行事や人生儀礼に関わる比重が高いのに対し、新宗教では日常生活で遭遇する現実的な問題解決に熱心である。人生の様々な悩みについて、信者たちは教団の指導を仰いだり、信者同士で話し合いの機会を持つ。伝統宗教に比べ、専従者と非専従者の境界がそれほど重要とされないのも特徴である。宗教が平和運動や福祉、ボランティア活動と関わる際にも、新宗教は重要な役割を果たしてきた。
かつて伝統宗教も分裂を繰り返してきたように、新宗教もカリスマ性を喪失するなどして分派することも多い（霊友会系教団、真光系諸教団など）。

平成期 - 2000年代以後現在の新宗教の信者の大半は、二世信者以降となっており、誕生して幼い頃から家庭環境やコミュニティの影響等によりその宗教に接しているため、特別な入信動機は存在しないことが多い。初代の信者の入信動機で最も広くみられるのは、「病気による苦境」である。かつての新宗教の入信動機は、貧困といった経済的事由、病気をはじめとした健康問題、人間関係のトラブル(いわゆる「貧・病・争」)といった精神的苦痛が、多数を占めており、剥奪的動機により説明されることが多かった。しかし、戦後の高度経済成長期の終盤を迎えるころから、入信動機に精神的な満足や充足を求める割合が増えている。こうした変化はあるものの、新宗教においては現世的なものが重要な役割を果たしている。新宗教では、苦難に遭遇した理由や原因を説明することも多く、こうした悩みに対し、既存の伝統宗教にも共通する神仏への信仰のみならず、特別な力を持つとされる教祖への個人崇拝的信仰、勤行読経・唱題、手かざし、先祖供養等の方法により、悩みを直接的に解決できると打ち出すことも多いが、多くの場合、もっとも重要とされるのは本人の「心なおし」である。過去の心の在り方を反省し、心の持ち方を改め、他者に常に善意と感謝を持って対することが最も重要とされている点は、多数の新宗教教団に共通している。新宗教の教えとは「心なおし」の教えといってよいほど、多数の教団の教えの核心部分にこの「心なおし」が関わっている。

伝統宗教との関わり
日本最大の新宗教教団である日蓮・鎌倉仏教系創価学会が戸田城聖同会第二代会長時代に（当時は既存仏教宗派の一つである日蓮正宗の信徒団体）、「謗法払い」と称して他の宗教・宗派の崇拝対象を撤去させたので、新宗教の信者は伝統宗教に対して攻撃的であるというイメージが形成されたが、大半の新宗教では、伝統宗教への関わりは肯定的である。
戦前から戦後しばらくまで伝統宗教側では、新宗教は人々を惑わす低級な宗教だという評価が一般的であった。他方で、新宗教の急激な信者増加に注目し、その現象を見極めようとする動きも生まれた。その後、新宗連が結成され、新宗教の側から宗教協力が推進されたことで、伝統宗教との摩擦を小さくする努力が行われた。新宗教の信者たちは、日常生活の悩みについては自分の入会している教団を訪れるが、葬儀や法事等は伝統的な仏教宗派に依頼し、新宗教と伝統宗教との間には、暗黙裡に一種の役割分担、棲み分けが行われている例がよく観察される。一方で、伝統宗教である日蓮正宗と、創価学会、冨士大石寺顕正会、正信会のように激しい対立に至る事例もある。

言及
宗教学者
島薗進は、1970年代以降発展した新宗教を「新新宗教」と呼ぶ立場を取り、新新宗教を「隔離型」「個人参加型」「中間型」の3つに分類している。そのうち「隔離型」の団体は、世俗の職業生活や家庭生活を放棄して強固な共同体を形成しようとするために、トラブルを起こしがちであり、反社会的な「カルト」教団と批判される団体の多くは隔離型であるとしている。「隔離型教団」の代表的な例として、オウム真理教、旧統一教会（名称変更以後：世界平和統一家庭連合）、エホバの証人を挙げている。「個人参加型」は、「隔離型」と対極の特徴を示し、共同体としての人間的結合は散漫である。「中間型」は、「隔離型」と「個人参加型」の両極端の間に位置する。1970年代以前に発展した新宗教は、パーフェクト リバティー教団や生長の家などが個人参加型、創価学会やほんみちなどが隔離型に近い特徴があるものの、ほとんどの教団が中間型に属するとしている。「個人参加型」「隔離型」の教団が登場した要因として、情報化が進んで社会構造が複雑化・多様化し、人と人との絆が弱まり、それを反映して個人主義的な考え方が広まってきたこと、一方で、そうした一般社会の趨勢に対抗し、緊密な共同体の形成を目指すとき、隔離型の教団が形成されるとしている。
石井研士は、日本では「宗教団体が、いい意味でも悪い意味でも社会問題化するときには、あまりに実態を無視した、性急で、理念的な分析や意見が飛び交っているように思えてならない。」と述べている。
島田裕巳は、ある新宗教が社会からカルトして糾弾されるのは、その教団が、世直しの思想や終末論を強調したときであるという。過度な世直し思想や終末論により危機感を煽ることで、過激な布教や多額の献金を集めている場合は、反社会的な行動に出る可能性が高まるとしている。
井上順孝は、新宗教教団の公称信者数は平均すると、実際の4～5倍程度と推測している。

社会学者
社会学の新宗教運動研究では、現代社会において代替宗教グループへの改宗や所属がどのように機能するか、多岐に渡って研究されてきた。新宗教の研究は当初から、1960年代・1970年代の文化的混乱を分析して洞察を提供した。当時、既存の宗教に不満を抱いた多くの若者が、替わりとなるスピリチュアルな（霊的な）道を求めるようになっていた。社会学の分野では、新宗教の探求者の台頭は、偽善的で物質主義的な社会における、生きる意味と道徳的構造の探求として説明され、研究の大部分は、特に非西洋の宗教グループ（たとえば、ディバイン・ライト・ミッションやハレー・クリシュナ運動）の重要性を強調したが、キリスト教に基づく運動も多く研究された。
学者たちは、これらの運動は神や聖なるものとの、より親密で近い関係を約束するだけでなく、友情、社会的受容、愛など、重要な社会的ニーズを満たすと指摘した。 1960年代・1970年代の宗教運動は、スピリチュアルな関係の新しい形として、疎外感が強まる世界に親密さとコミュニティを提供し、これらの運動の多くは家族の代替として機能し、感情的およびスピリチュアルな（霊的な）愛着が奨励され、発達した。
社会学研究は、現代社会における新宗教運動の意味と価値を強調する傾向があったが、社会心理学の分野では、これに反対する研究も現れた。こうした研究では、不安定で機能不全な人間として表現されることが多い新宗教の信者の性格特性を強調する改宗理論を構築し、より洗練された研究には、思想改造理論と精神分析理論を改宗に応用したものもあった。新宗教運動はこうした理論的枠組みの中で、厳格で妥協のない善悪の定義に基づき過激なイデオロギーや過激な行動を育む全体主義的な環境とみなされていた。

左派イデオロギー
フェミニスト社会学研究者は、新宗教のコミュニティの発展におけるジェンダーの役割とジェンダー階層構造に焦点を当て、1978年にはエミリー・カルペッパーが新宗教運動への改宗における家父長制の側面について論じ、これらの新宗教のグループのほとんどは、男性優位の伝統的宗教組織に代わる選択肢になっていないことを示した。他のフェミニスト研究者もこれに続き、女性を肉体、男性を精神と結び付けるその神学における女性の地位の問題が検討され、これらの新宗教運動は、女性の行動やセクシュアリティを運動内で規制し、管理するという目的を持っていた。また性的搾取の問題があり、民族誌データにより、女性信者は男性信者と運動の指導者の性的ニーズを満たすことが期待されているだけでなく、自身の性的能力を利用して新メンバーを勧誘することも期待されていることが明らかになった。1980年代までに、新宗教運動を研究するフェミニスト研究者は、これらの運動は信者を暴力や虐待から保護できていないことを指摘し、新しい、より批判的な立場をとるようになり、この批判的アプローチが新宗教運動における虐待研究の基礎となった。この研究分野は、身体的暴力や性的暴力を含む幅広い行動を網羅している。研究の初期においては、信者の報告で、女性信者が従順と服従を求められたことが語られており、信者はグルの足元にひれ伏したり、身体的罰や公衆の面前での屈辱に耐えることによって信仰を示すこと等を強いられていた。宗教的「献身」に関するその他の報告では、児童虐待、身体的危害の脅迫、規則違反や不服従行為に対する孤立と追放が語られていた。
新宗教の暴力に関する研究の範囲と定義が拡大するにつれ、ジェンダーに基づく虐待のパターンが浮かび上がっていき、児童性的虐待、近親相姦、強姦、暴行、強制売春、「スピリチュアルな（霊的な）報酬」と引き換えの性行為の要求、宗教指導者による信者への性病の感染などが含まれる。すべての新宗教運動がこうした虐待を特徴とするわけではないが、ファミリー・インターナショナル、ラブ・ファミリー、オショー＝ラジニーシ運動、様々な仏教系コミュニティなど、多数のグループにこれらの暴力の形態が1つ以上みられた。データが明らかにしているように、新宗教運動におけるこうした虐待のパターンは、小規模な共同体にも大規模な共同体にも、東洋的なグループにも西洋的なグループにも、そして単一または複数の宗教的・社会的単位を持つ組織にも見られる。
虐待的な歴史を持つ新宗教グループには、次のような特徴が共通していると思われる。

強いカリスマ性のある男性リーダーの存在
男性のエリート信者集団が権力を持つ、構造化された指揮命令系統
女性の服従と男性の優位性という伝統的な概念を強化する一連の信念（教義）
厳格なジェンダー規範や行動を縛る規律と信仰実践
すべてのケースではないが、多くの場合、家族をベースとした社会構造で、リーダーは父親的存在として位置づけられており、その権威は絶対的で、誰も異論を唱えることはできない
こうした研究結果は、宗教社会学、特に新宗教運動の問題よりも美徳に注目する学者との間で論争を巻き起こした。新宗教運動に関する社会学文献のほとんどは、ジェンダーに基づく暴力や性的搾取という難しい問題を避け、宗教的関与の建設的かつ機能的な側面を強調してきた。ジャネット・ジェイコブスは、学術会議や文献のレビューでは、フェミニスト的視点を持つ社会学者たちは厳しく批判され、情報提供者の話は攻撃され、疑いの目で見られると述べている。フェミニスト社会学者の新宗教研究を批判する学者たちは、集団自殺と集団殺人に焦点を当て、新宗教における暴力的・虐待的な問題は例外的なものだと主張しており、新宗教における激しい制裁や性的虐待はめったに真剣に扱われることはなく、重視されていない。ジャネット・ジェイコブスは、社会学研究における宗教的暴力の様々な側面、特にジェンダーに基づく虐待に関する議論の欠如は、女性と少女が危険にさらされやすいという虐待パターンの観点から特に憂慮すべきだと苦言を呈している。

한국 불교의 특성
삼국 시대에 전래된 이후 오랜 시간이 흐르는 동안 한국불교는 토착화되면서 한국인에 맞는 한국적 특성을 지닌 종교 사상이 되었는데, 그 특성은 다음 세 가지로 요약할 수 있다.
첫째, 한국 불교는 인도나 중국에서 분화되었던 사상을 융합하려는 통불교적 성격의 노력이 컸다. 이는 원효의 화쟁사상, 의천의 교관겸수, 지눌의 정혜쌍수의 사상 등에서 보듯이 교종에 속하더라도 선정 수행을 중시하고 선종에 속하더라도 교가(교종)의 공부를 경시하지 않았던 것에서 잘 나타난다.
둘째, 사상 체계를 요약하여 수행을 통해 자심(自心)을 밝히는 것을 중시하였다. 이는 원효의 일심사상, 신라말기와 고려초의 선종 구산, 고려 중기 이후의 오교 양종, 조선 시대의 선교 양종, 현대의 조계종의 출현, 성철의 돈오돈수 사상 등으로 이어지는 흐름 속에서 잘 나타난다.
셋째, 위태로운 때를 당하면 불교에 의지하려는 생각이 깊었는데 호국불교(護國佛敎)의 사상적 명맥을 거기에서 찾을 수 있다. 호국불교의 사상은 자장의 불국토 사상, 전륜성왕의 이념 확립, 황룡사ㆍ 불국사ㆍ석굴암의 건립, 팔만대장경의 완성, 임진왜란 때의 승병의 활동 등에서 잘 나타난다.

한국 불교의 역사
한국의 불교는 1,700여년 전인 삼국시대(三國時代)에 중국과 해상 루트를 거쳐 들어온 사상으로서 한국민족과 자라온 중요한 종교사상의 하나가 되었다. 기록 상 최초의 불교 전래는 고구려 소수림왕 때로 알려져 있으나, 실제로는 소수림왕 전 시기에 불교가 상당 부분 고구려 각처에 퍼져있었던 것으로 보인다. 삼국시대의 나라들이 불교를 받아들인 것은 율령 체제 정비와 그 궤를 같이한다. 불교는 도입된 이래 삼(사)국의 주요 통치 이념이었으며, 고려 시대에는 정치 이념이었던 유교와 함께 가장 강력한 통치 이념이었다. 고려 후기에는 불교 교리의 실천을 망각하고 권력화하여 타락함으로써 고려 왕조를 몰락으로 이끈 경향이 짙었고, 조선 초의 배불 숭유 정책을 초래하였다. 그러나 세조는 불교의 영적 가치를 재발견하고 김수온 등의 건의로 이를 부흥시켰다.
남북국시대 신라 말기에 중국의 선종이 전파되었으며 고려 시대 이후 한국 불교는 선종을 중심으로 한 통불교, 즉 선-교 양종의 통합 불교가 주축을 이루었다. 근대 이후 한국 불교의 주류는 선종이다. 해방이후 비구-대처분쟁이후 비구 종단은 대한불교조계종을 중심으로 정립되었고, 조계종은 현재까지 한국 불교의 대표 종단이다. 불교 대승 종단은 소의 경전을 중심으로 나눌 수 있다.

용어
한국에서는 한국의 전통적인 샤머니즘을 무속(巫俗), 무교(巫敎),무(巫)라고 하는데, 이들은 고유의 관점이 존재하는 말들이다. 무속은 불교학자 이능화가 샤머니즘을 전통적인 관습으로 이해하여 처음 사용한 말이며, 지금은 국문학자들과 민속학자들이 즐겨 사용하고 있다. 무교는 개신교 신학자 유동식이 처음 사용한 단어이며, 샤머니즘을 기독교, 불교, 이슬람처럼 독립된 종교로 존중하는 중립적 입장의 종교학자들이 사용한다. 무(巫)는 인류학자 조흥윤이 사용한 말이며, 한국의 샤머니즘을 독특한 개성을 가진 전통으로 존중한다는 뜻을 갖고 있다.

개요
상고시대의 무속
무속은 일종의 샤머니즘, 애니미즘 등 원시 신앙과 기타 종교 요소가 결합한 형태로 그 기원은 원시인들의 샤머니즘 의식에서부터 찾아볼 수 있다. 울산 반구대 암각화에는 춤추는 샤먼의 그림이 있으며, 청동기 시대는 제정 일치 사회였기 때문에 일반적으로 정치 집단의 지도자가 종교 집단까지 거느렸는데 이들이 족장이며 또한 제사장이었다. 이들이 거행했던 의식이 무속의 기원이 된다고 보는 견해가 많다.

고대 국가와 삼국 시대의 무속
무속의 기원은 일반적으로 고조선 때로 잡는다. 김영하 교수 등 단군을 몽골의 천신인 텡그리와 같다고 주장하는 학자들이 많이 있다. 단군 왕검에서 단군은 한국 고유의 말을 한자로 표현한 것으로 제정 일치 사회의 제사장, 즉 종교의 우두머리를 뜻하며 왕검은 왕을 뜻한다는 설이 있다. 고조선 때부터 제천 의식이 더욱 발전하고 고구려, 부여, 마한, 예 등의 국가가 세워지면서 고조선 제천 의식이 발달하게 되었다. 제천 의식은 문화적 특질과 종교적 특질 모두를 가지고 있는데, 삼국지 위지 동이전에는 고대국가 부여, 고구려, 예, 마한 등의 나라가 모두 제천의례를 거행한다고 기록하고 있다. 부여의 영고, 고구려의 동맹, 백제의 무천, 마한의 천제는 신라와 고려대에 이르러 팔관회라는 이름으로 유지되었다.

중세와 근현대 국가에서 무속
유학이 조선의 기본 이데올로기가 됨에 따라 무속에 대한 탄압이 가해져 무당이 천민으로 전락했고, 일제강점기를 거치며 탄압받았다. 성리학이 지배이념이었던 조선시대에도 무당들은 사람들의 질병을 돌볼 때 정성을 다하지 않으면 벌을 주라고 할 정도로 치유능력이 있는 자로 여겨졌다. 1945년 8월 15일 광복 이후 조선민주주의인민공화국에서는 미신으로 간주되어 거의 사라졌고 대한민국에서 그나마 명맥을 유지하고 있다. 하지만 대한민국의 무속 또한 박정희 정권 당시 벌어진 소위 '미신타파운동'으로 인해 탄압받았다.

역사
고조선
무속은 역사적으로 아주 오래된 종교인데, 고조선 시대에도 존재했다고 보는 것이 보통이다. 고조선 시대를 상징하는 건국 신화인 단군신화를 보면, 곰과 호랑이가 나오고 천신의 자손 환웅이란 용어가 나온다. 이외에도 태백산, 신단수 등을 신성시하는 것으로 보아, 애니미즘, 토테미즘 등을 그 시대에 믿었음을 알 수 있다. 또한 당시는 제정 일치 사회였으므로 종교 지도자와 정치 지도자가 구분되지 않았다. 애니미즘과 토테미즘, 샤머니즘은 지금도 무속의 핵심적인 요소로 남아있다.

삼국 시대와 고삼국 시대
고삼국 시대 삼한과 부여, 고구려, 옥저, 동예 등 여러 국가에서는 제천 의식을 비롯한 여러 종교적 의식을 가지고 있었는데, 지금도 일부 남아있는 솟대나 당산목 등이 이 때 기원을 두고 있다고 보는 것이 일반적 견해이다. 솟대는 새를 꽃은 나무로 새를 하늘과 땅의 중개자로 보는 신앙에서 비롯되었다. 또한 농업이 철기의 사용으로 발달되고 국가 간 전쟁이 더욱 치열해지자 고대 국가들은 백성들을 단합한다는 취지에서 큰 종교 행사를 열었는데, 이것이 제천 의식이다.

통일 신라 시대
유교, 불교와 같은 외래사상의 수용과 건국 시조와의 연관성을 통한 왕권 계승자 의식 확립으로 제천의례가 쇠퇴한다.

고려 시대
고려시대는 무속이라고 규정지을 수 있는 개인적인 굿 또는 무당이 개입한 제의의 역사가 구체화된 시기이다. 신이 내리는 데는 남녀·귀천을 가리지 않았다. 충선왕 때 내부령(內府令)을 지냈고 충숙왕 때에 찬성사(贊成事)가 된 강융(姜融)의 누이는 무당이 되어 송악사(松岳祠)에 기식하였고, 공민왕 때 판숭경부사가 된 지윤(池奫)의 어머니도 무당이었다.

처용(處容)무는 고려시대에 처음으로 궁중 의례화되었다. 고려시대 무속은 몇 가지 점에서 근래와 유사한 상태를 보여 준다. 고려시대 무의(巫儀)가 이미 현대의 굿과 같은 구조를 지녔다.
고려시대에 와서 하늘에 대한 제사가 다시 중시 된다. 고려의 국조 세계 설화에 평나산(平那山) 산신이 등장하는 것을 비롯하여, 산신이 대단히 중요시되었다.

조선 시대
국행 의례를 무당이 주관하는 전통은 지속되고 있었으나 성리학을 정치 이념으로 내세운 지배 권력이 무속을 음사(淫祀)로 규정하고 여러 가지 제도와 장치를 통해 노골적으로 무속을 탄압하였다.

조선 세종 시대부터 불교 승려들의 도성 출입 금지가 시작되며 무당들도 도성에서 쫓겨난다. 무당은 짐승만도 못한 취급을 받던 천민 부류에 속하였으나, 조선 후기의 무당은 주로 양인 신분이다. 호구수에서 대체로 무당의 숫자가 적어서 대규모의 굿을 행하기는 어려웠다고 판단된다. 영조시대에는 궁궐에서나 사대부들이 무속을 겉으로는 경시하면서도 속으로는 깊이 믿었음을 알 수 있는 기록이 영조실록에 있다.

태백산에서 제의를 주관한 제관은 고려는 국가에서 파견한 관리가 주도하였으나 조선시대에는 국가 제의에서 제외되며 향리나 민간인이 제의를 주도하게 된다.

일제 강점기
일제의 탄압이 있었으나 당시 조선인들은 계속 신앙심을 유지해 왔다. 일제가 조선땅에 일본 신토를 섬기는 신사를 지으며 국사당을 강제로 옮긴 일도 있었다.

조선 후기부터 구국의 성지로 부각되기 시작한 태백산 천제단에서는 구국을 위한 의례가 행하여지면서 제의가 천제(天祭)의 형식을 갖추게 된다.

해방 이후
한국전쟁 중에는 헬기 착륙장 조성으로 천제단이 헐린다.
새마을 운동 때 정부에서 실행한 미신타파운동으로 탄압받았지만 현대에 오히려 신자가 늘어나고 있다. 이 계몽 운동으로 집안과 마을을 결속해주는 고리가 상당 부분이 없어졌다. 무속신앙이 미신으로 간주되지 않고 제대로 존중받고 전승되었다면 미신으로 인한 많은 사회적 병폐가 많이 줄었을 것이며, 개인과 가족, 마을의 결속력이 좋아져 사회가 더 살기 좋게 발전하였을 수도 있었다.

강신무와 세습무
무속에서 신령과 사람사이를 이어주는 중재자 즉, 샤먼을 무당(巫堂)이라고 한다. 한국에서는 무당을 당골이라고도 부르며, 크게 강신무와 세습무로 나눈다. 강신무는 대체로 한강 이북에서, 세습무는 한강 이남과 동해안 일대에서 전해졌다. 강신무는 일반인으로 살아가다가 어느 순간 무병을 앓게 되고 내림굿을 통해 신내림을 받아서 신령을 몸주신으로 모시는 무당을 일컬으며, 세습무는 조정래의 대하소설 《태백산맥》의 소화처럼 집안의 인척관계로 계승되는 무당을 말한다.
광복 이후 세습무들은 조선시대때 무당이기 때문에 받던 괄시를 피해, 무당 집안임을 숨기는 일이 많아졌고, 한국전쟁 때 미신과 종교를 금지하는 조선민주주의인민공화국 정부의 탄압을 피해서 대한민국으로 옮긴 강신무들이 그 자리를 차지해 무당이라고 하면 거의 대부분 강신무로 인식하는 경향이 있으나, 아직도 대한민국의 동해안 지역과 호남지역에는 세습무의 전통이 유지되고 있으며, 세습무가 하는 강릉 단오굿과 동해안 별신굿, 진도 씻김굿 등은 국가무형문화재로 지정되어 전승되고 있다.(진도씻김굿을 하는 무당을 진도에서는 당골이라고 한다.)

역사
의암 손병희 선생의 천도교 조직사업
동학 농민 운동이 진압되고 동학의 2대 교주인 최시형(崔時亨)이 1898년 순교한 뒤, 3대 교주가 된 손병희(孫秉熙)는 교정일치론(敎政一致論)을 강조하며 조직의 재정비와 여러 가지 개혁적인 시도를 감행하였다. 그러나 그는 조선정부의 탄압으로 중국을 거쳐 1901년 안경장수로 위장하여 일본으로 건너갔고, 그해 9월 잠시 귀국하였다가 1902년 다시 일본을 거쳐 미국에 가고자 했으나 일제의 방해로 일본에 머무르게 되었다. 이때 일본에 망명중이던 개화파 지식인들과 교류하며 새로운 인식을 얻는 한편, 국내와의 연락을 통해 교인들을 규합하여 동학을 재정비하였다. 그러나 손병희의 일본 체류가 결과적으로 일본제국주의에 대한 동학교도들의 민족적 저항력을 약화시키게 되어, 동학교도들이 기존 정치체제의 개혁세력으로 참여하기 위해 1904년 9월부터 전국적으로 조직하였던 진보회가 친일단체화하기에 이르렀다. 이에 손병희는 정교(政敎) 분리의 원칙을 내걸고 종교로서의 동학을 고수하고자 1905년 12월 1일 교명을 ‘천도교’로 개칭하였다.
1906년 귀국하여 교회를 재조직하기 시작하였으며, ‘천도교대헌’을 반포하고 새로운 교단조직을 확립하였다. 서울에 중앙총본부를 두어 대도주(大道主)가 관할하게 하였고, 지방을 72개 대교구로 분할하여 교령(敎領)이 담당하도록 하였다. 또한 정당활동을 금지하고, 교리·교체(敎體)·교제(敎制)·오의(五儀；呪文·淸文·侍日·誠米·祈禱)를 제정하였으며, 다수의교서를 발간하여 동학 이래의 사상체계를 확립하였다.

삼일운동
새로운 교리와 체제가 확립되자 10년부터 포교활동과 함께 출판·교육 등의 문화운동을 전개하여 교세가 비약적으로 발전하게 되었고, 그 결과 3·1운동에서 천도교가 기독교, 불교와 더불어 민족대표로 참여하여 중추적 역할을 담당하였다. 많은 교도들이 옥고를 치르고 일제의 탄압을 받았으나, 1919년 9월 천도교 청년교리강연부를 설립하고 이듬해 이를 천도교청년회로 개편하여 전국지부를 결성하는 등 지속적인 활동을 전개하였다.

교육사업
1920년에 종합잡지 《개벽》을 비롯하여 《신여성》·《학생》·《어린이》 등의 월간잡지를 간행하였는데, 특히 《개벽》은 일제의 탄압으로 1926년 통권 72호로 폐간될 때까지 천도교 교리를 통해 민중의 주체적 자각과 근대문물 섭취에 크게 이바지하였다. 의암 손병희 선생의 사위인 소파 방정환 선생도 천도교 교당에서 동화구연을 하고, 《어린이》를 발행하는 등 어린이 교육사업에 헌신하였다.

농민운동
세계일보에 따르면 천도교는 협동조합, 농민교육 등의 농민운동을 했다.
천도교 청년당은 1908년 일제가 토지조사령 등 명목으로 토지 수탈을 감행하자 농민부를 비롯한 7부문 운동을 전개하면서 농민운동에 적극 대처했다. 1925년에는 조선농민사를 창립한 뒤 월간 ‘조선농민’을 발간해 농민교양사업에 힘썼다. 농민사는 1931년 농민공생조합을 결성, 전국적으로 공동경작을 시행하는 한편 평양에 농민고무공장을 만들어 고무신을 염가에 공급했다. 1937년 일제의 대륙 침략(중일전쟁)으로 국내 모든 자생적 농민운동이 막을 내리기 전까지 천도교 농민운동은 당시 사회주의 계열인 조선농민총동맹보다 더 큰 규모로 농민운동을 이끌어 갔다.

천도교 청년당
1923년 천도교청년회를 개편하여 천도교청년당을 세우고 학술연구부를 두어 〈자수대학강의(自修大學講義)〉를 발행함으로써 한국청년의 지적 향상을 도모하였다. 한편 1921년에 교회의 중앙전제(中央專制) 가 지방대의제로 개정되고 교주제가 중의제(衆議制)로 변경되었는데, 이듬해 손병희가 죽자 이러한 신파는 ‘천도교연합회’를 결성하고 구파와 대립하였다. 또한 박인호(朴寅鎬)의 제4대교주 인정문제를 둘러싸고 이를 인정하는 교인대회파와 부정하는 중앙종리원파 및 통일기성회파가 대립하였고, 1926년 교인대화파와 통일기성회파가 타협하여 중앙종리원을 만들면서 신구 중앙 종리원이 공존하였다. 이듬해 구파 종리원에서 교인대회파가 다시 분리되었다. 1931년 신파측의 천도교청년당과 구파측의 천도교청년동맹이 합쳐 천도교청우당을 발족하였고 이후 교회조직이 강화되었다. 그러나, 1934년 독립만세운동을 벌이려다 230명이 검거된 천도교오심당사건이 일어났고, 1937년 천도교청우당이 해체당하는 등 일제의 탄압을 받았다.

광복이후
광복 후 남·북지역 교도간의 연락이 어려워졌고 1948년에 남한에서는 신구파가 합쳐졌으나 북한의 교회활동은 위축되었다. 남한에서는 1953년 서울 수복 후 중앙총부를 서울로 이전하였고, 1961년 최시형·손병희의 법설이 포함된 〈천도교경전〉이 간행되었으며 1972년 천도교의 중심역할을 하는 수운회관(水雲會館)이 준공되었다.

조직 및 운영
천도교의 최고 지도자는 교령이라 불리고, 대의원 회의에서 선출된다. 교령의 임기는 3년이고, 단임제이다. 현 교령은 2019년 3월 15일에 열린 제39차 정기전국대의원대회에서 당선된  제35대 송범두 교령.

교세 및 현황
1920년대에는 신도 수가 300만 명에 이르렀으나, 1922년 손병희 교조의 죽음으로 신·구파로 갈리며 교세가 하락하기 시작하였다. 1930년에 두 교파는 잠시 결합했다가, 1932년 다시 갈라서고, 1940년에 다시 합쳐진다. 1970년대 초에 천도교는 대통령 박정희의 지원을 받고, 용담정이 복구되고 수운회관도 세워졌으나, 당시 외무장관까지 지냈던 최덕신 교령이 월북하는 사건이 벌어진다. 이어 1997년에는 오익제 교령까지 월북하면서, 어려움을 겪었다. 현재 신도 수는 10만 명 정도로 추정되며, 100여 개의 교구가 있다.
