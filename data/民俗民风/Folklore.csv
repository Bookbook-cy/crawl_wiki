Contents
The heroes of this poem are two brothers, Alha and Udal (or incarnation of Babra Bahan), the generals of Parmal’s army who fought in the battle of Mahoba between Prithviraj III and Parmal in c.1182. The narration begins with the early exploits of Alha and Udal. They fought with the Karingarai (or Kalingarai) and killed him to avenge the killings of their father Dassaraj (or Dasraj) and uncle Baccharaj. Later they fought the battle of Mahoba. According to the Bhojpuri and the Kannauji recensions, Alha married Sonvati (Sonva), the princess of Nainagarh (Chunar), while according to the some other Western Hindi recensions he married Macchil, the daughter of Raghomacch of Haridwar. Apart from Alha and Udal, the brave deeds of other heroes like Malkhan and Sulkhan (the sons of Baccharaj), Brahamjit (the son of Parmal) and Talhan Syed are also described in this work. This work narrates the details of fifty-two wars in total.

Historicity
While the poetic licence is apparent in the modern versions of the ballads, the attack of Prithviraj Chauhan is directly attested by two inscriptions of 1182CE at Madanpur near Lalitpur in a Jain temple.
Alha is sometimes called Alhan. Alhan (अल्हण) was a popular name in 12-13th century in North India.
The genealogy of Chandela ruler Parmal (Parmardi) given in Mahoba Khand or Alha Khand does not match the genealogy given in Chandela inscriptions. In Mahoba Khand, the father, grandfather and the great-grandfather of Parmal are given as Kirtibramha, Madanbrahma, and Rahilbramha. While Madanavarman (1129-1163), Kirttivarman (1070-1098) and Rahila (9th century) were indeed ancestors of Paramardi (1166-1202), most names and the sequence do not match.
The Alha Khand states the end of the Chandellas after Parmal. That is not supported by history. The Chandelas became very weak after the attack by Prithviraj, but the dynasty lingered on at least until 1308, i.e. another century.
A Jain temple in Chhatarpur has an Adinath image installed in Samvat 1208 (1151 AD). According to one reading of the inscription, it mentions Alha, Udal and the entire group. However other scholars have read the inscription differently.
During the Chandella rule, Aharji was a flourishing Jain center in Bundelkhand. It was the site of a massive pratishta in samvat 1237 (1180 CE), many images bearing that date have been found, including a monumental image that mention Paramardideva as the ruling king. With the exception of a single samvat 1241 image, the activity ceased as a result of the Chandella defeat in samvat 1239.

In popular culture
Sabse Bade Ladaiya, a television series based on the ballad aired on DD National from 2012.

Their general teaching is that the easy life and seeming good fortune of others conceal a threat to their welfare.

Eastern and Western variations
The earliest Latin version of this tale is in a poem by Phaedrus and concerns a pig that was fattened on barley and then sacrificed. The left-over grain was given to the ass, who refused it because of the fate that had overtaken the one it had previously fed. The kind of skewed logic in operation here, seeming to confuse cause and effect, is often found in the fables and led Aristophanes to characterise such stories as 'Aesop's jests'. Its function, however, is to fix attention on the distinction in practical philosophy between the immediate and the ultimate good. An unsolicited meal is the immediate good in this story, but the ultimate good is to consider where acceptance of an immediate advantage might lead. Phaedrus himself does just this. He tells the story in the poem's first six lines and follows them with six more lines of personal reflections upon it. 'This fable taught me caution and I have avoided risky business ventures ever since - but, you say, 'those who grab wealth get to keep it'. Just remember how many of them are eventually caught and killed! Clearly, the ones who have been punished constitute the larger crowd. A few people may profit from reckless behaviour, but many more are ruined by it.'

Although this story was not taken up by later authors, another concerning an ox and a heifer had a little more currency and is given a separate number in the Perry Index (300). In this a bullock compares his own carefree existence with that of an ox compelled to labour in the fields. Shortly afterwards the owner releases the ox from his yoke but binds the bullock and leads him away to be sacrificed. Then the ox informs the victim, 'It was for this reason that you were allowed to live in idleness.' The common feature between Phaedrus' story and this involves the survival of a working animal while the one that leads a life of ease meets an early and violent death. In his edition, Samuel Croxall includes this fable under the title ""The Wanton Calf"" and draws from it the lesson that those who despise the honest poor are often criminals who eventually pay for their way of life. Phaedrus had similarly made the link between grasping the immediate advantage and criminality. The moral is further summed up by the short poem that Thomas Bewick adds in his reprinting of Croxall's fable:

Thus oft the industrious poor endures reproach
From rogues in lace, and sharpers in a coach;
But soon to Tyburn sees the villains led
While he still earns in peace his daily bread.
A much earlier Indian version of the story makes the relationship between the two Aesopic tales a little clearer. It appears in the Buddhist scriptures as the Munika-Jataka and is accompanied by a frame story in which a monk regrets the life of ease he has left and is tempted back. His situation is made clear to him by the relation of an animal fable (supposedly of a former birth) in which a young ox complains to his elder brother of the easy lot of the farmyard pig. Soon afterwards the pig is slaughtered for a marriage feast and the ox finds comfort in the reflection that a simpler diet is at least a guarantee of survival. Although different pairs of animals are involved in largely different situations, and although the conclusions that their authors draw from them differ too, their trend is always the same. In an unstable world, a life of humble drudgery has its rewards.
The Jataka tale travelled westwards in a variety of new versions. Much the same story, with asses in the place of oxen, appears as a Midrash in the Jewish Great Commentary on Esther 3.2. It reappears in a much changed form in the One Thousand and One Nights as the tale of ""The Ass, the Ox and the Labourer"". Here an ox complains to an ass of its hard life and is advised to play sick; this it does to such effect that the ass is put to work in its place. In order to avoid any more such labour, the ass informs the ox that he has overheard their master giving orders for the ox to be butchered the following day, which brings a speedy end to its pretended illness.
A version of this story eventually reached Europe and is recorded in the 13th century by Odo of Cheriton. Envious of the easy life of the pig, an ass pretends to be sick, is put on a convalescent diet and soon begins to fatten. When the pig is slaughtered, however, it takes fright and returns to work. It may be coincidental that Odo's commentary on the story echoes the Jataka in picturing how the clergy may be seduced by the luxuries of lay life. Another element that the last two stories have in common is also shared with Phaedrus' story of ""The Ass and the Pig"". Association of a better diet with fattening before slaughter leads the animals who benefit from it to renounce such luxuries and the dangers they bring for a life of secure sufficiency. In this they share the same conclusion as the fable of The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse.

There are also several Eastern variants, and the story's interpretation varies accordingly.

Fables
Of the two Greek versions of this story, the one catalogued as number 188 in the Perry Index concerns an ass that puts on a lion's skin, and amuses himself by terrifying all the foolish animals. At last coming upon a fox, he tries to frighten him also, but the fox no sooner hears the sound of his voice than he exclaims, ""I might possibly have been frightened myself, if I had not heard your bray."" The moral of the story is often quoted as, clothes may disguise a fool, but his words will give him away. It is this version that appears as Fable 56 in the collection by Babrius.
The second version is listed as number 358 in the Perry Index. In this the ass puts on the skin in order to be able to graze undisturbed in the fields, but he is given away by his ears and is chastised. In addition to the Greek versions, there is a Latin version by Avianus, dating from the later fifth century.  This version was adapted by William Caxton, with the moral cautioning against presumption. Literary allusions to this fable have been frequent since classical times and into the Renaissance, such as in William Shakespeare's King John. La Fontaine's Fable 5.21 (1668) also follows this version.  The moral La Fontaine draws is not to trust to appearances, because clothes do not make the man.

Folk motifs and proverbial use
In India, the same situation appears in Buddhist scriptures as the Sihacamma Jataka.  Here the ass's master puts the lion's skin over his beast, and turns it loose to feed in the grain fields during his travels.  The village watchmen are usually too terrified to do anything, but finally one of them raises the villagers.  When they chase the ass, it begins to bray, betraying its true identity, and is then beaten to death.  A related tale, the Sihakottukha Jataka, plays on the motif of being given away by one's voice.  In this story, a lion sires a son on a she-jackal.  The child resembles his father, but has a jackal's howl, and is therefore advised to remain silent. A common European variant on this theme appears in the Ladino Sephardic proverb, asno callado, por sabio contado: ""a silent ass is considered wise."" An English equivalent is ""a fool is not known until he opens his mouth."" A similar Biblical proverb is “Even a fool is counted wise when he holds his peace; When he shuts his lips, he is considered perceptive.”
The story and its variants are alluded to idiomatically in various languages.  In Latin it is leonis exuviae super asinum. In Mandarin Chinese it is ""羊質虎皮"" (pronunciation:yang(2) zhi(4) hu(3) pi(2)), ""a goat in a tiger's skin.""  In the Chinese story, a goat disguises itself as a lion, but continues to eat grass as usual.  When it spies a wolf, instinct takes over and the goat takes to its heels.

Later allusions
""The Ass in the Lion's Skin"" was one of the several Aesop's fables put to use by American political cartoonist Thomas Nast, when it was rumoured in 1874 that Republican president Ulysses S. Grant intended to stand for election for an unprecedented third term in 1876.  At the same time, there was a false report that animals had escaped from the Central Park Zoo, and were roaming the streets of New York.  Nast combined the two items in a cartoon for the November 7 edition of Harpers Weekly.  Titled ""Third Term Panic"", it depicts a donkey in a lion's skin, labelled ""Caesarism"", and scattering other animals that stand for various interests.
In the twentieth century C. S. Lewis put the fable to use in The Last Battle, the final volume of The Chronicles of Narnia.  A donkey named Puzzle is tricked into wearing a lion's skin, and then manipulated so as to deceive the simple-minded into believing that Aslan the lion has returned to Narnia.  He then becomes a figurehead for a pseudo-government that works contrary to the interests of the Narnians.  Kathryn Lindskoog identifies the Avianus version as the source of this episode.

He is a warrior-hero, venerated as Rudra Ansh avatar. He is referenced in the folklore of Jammu. Little historical knowledge of him exists other than that he was son of Raja Ladh dev aka Raja Ladhha and Queen Kalavati aka Rani Kalli.

Kingdom
Baba Shivoji's father was King of Pattan. Pattan is one of the historical capitals of Kashmir, nearly in the centre of the valley. Pattan tehsil hosts the remains of four palaces including two within the municipal limits. Rajatarangini states that the king of Kashmir Shankaravarmma built a town named Pattana.

Legend
According to legend, Shivo was born with the blessings of Guru Gorakhnath, who blessed his parents Raja Ladh Dev and Rani Kalli to have a child like Lord Shiva, whose name was conferred on the child.

Early life
King Ladh dev had no child, until he showed his kundali to his kulguru, who told him that he could have only one thing in his destiny: either the kingdom or a child. Then on the recommendation of yogis, it was suggested that if he wanted a son then he must leave his kingdom and adopt austerity (tapasya) and pray to Gorakhnath for the child. After handing over the throne to his younger brother, both king and queen left for Sauram hills. After worshipping there for years, they moved towards Samotha, where they prayed to Gorakhnath for twelve years. Gorakhnath blessed them, saying that a son would be born to them who would be the incarnation of Rudra, and he should be named Shiv Dev (Shivo). After nine months, Shivo was born to them in the holy land of Samotha.

Other
When he grew up, he decided to work for the king of Jammu Raja Mal Dev in his palace. According to folklore, a lion came to the region and began to kill the public's animals; Raja announced that he would give a prize to a person who killed the lion. One day when Shivo was going towards Jammu, he saw the lion and killed it with his sword, then cut off its ears and put it under one of the palace's pillars. Due to this, the king realised that he was a godly man and touched his feet and Shivo gave spiritual gyaan to him.
Shivo played a musical instrument, the dotara. In the area surrounding Samotha, in the hills of Goran, lived Kharadkhatri Rajputs. When Shivo played the dotara, the women of Kharadkhatris came out of their homes to listen to the music. Kharadkhatri found his playing to be an insane act and conspired to kill Shivo while he was busy playing the dotara. They cut off the head of Baba, which remained there; his body travelled to the Goran where Babaji's temple was later constructed. Most of the Kharadkhatris were said to have been killed by the curse of Babaji, while others left the area and changed their Gots. It is said that the Baba Goran fulfills the wishes of devotees who pray with true heart and strong determination. Many people ask for wishes to the Baba and then offer bhandara (charity kitchen) at the temple after the wish is fulfilled. Goat sacrifices are also given there in the name of Babaji. Baba Shivo (Goran Baba) is the kuldev of Sarmal Clan of the Suryavanshi Dogra Rajputs. Devotees from Hindu and Muslim communities throng the shrine mainly on Sunday and Tuesday.

Festivals
Every year, a wrestling match is held in the name of Baba Shivo at the shrine. The Baba Shivo Chhadi pilgrimage (yatra) also takes place from Samotha to Goran.

After much tribulation the young prince's father accepted the Christian faith, turned over his throne to Josaphat, and retired to the desert to become a hermit. Josaphat himself later abdicated and went into seclusion with his old teacher Barlaam.

History
The story of Barlaam and Josaphat or Joasaph is a Christianized and later version of the story of Siddhartha Gautama, who became the Buddha. The tale derives from a second to fourth century Sanskrit Mahayana Buddhist text, via a Manichaean version, then the Arabic Kitāb Bilawhar wa-Būd̠āsaf (Book of Bilawhar and Budhasaf), current in Baghdad in the eighth century, from where it entered into Middle Eastern Christian circles before appearing in European versions.
The first Christianized adaptation was the Georgian epic Balavariani dating back to the 10th century. A Georgian monk, Euthymius of Athos, translated the story into Greek, some time before he died in an accident while visiting Constantinople in 1028. There the Greek adaptation was translated into Latin in 1048 and soon became well known in Western Europe as Barlaam and Josaphat. The Greek legend of ""Barlaam and Ioasaph"" is sometimes attributed to the 8th century John of Damascus, but F. C. Conybeare argued it was transcribed by Euthymius in the 11th century.
The story of Barlaam and Josaphat was popular in the Middle Ages, appearing in such works as the Golden Legend, and a scene there involving three caskets eventually appeared, via Caxton's English translation of a Latin version, in Shakespeare's ""The Merchant of Venice"". The poet Chardri produced an Anglo-Norman version, La vie de seint Josaphaz, in the 13th century. The story of Josaphat and Barlaam also occupies a great part of book xv of the Speculum Historiale (Mirror of History) by the 13th century French encyclopedist Vincent of Beauvais.
One of the Marco Polo manuscripts notes the remarkable similarity between the tale of ""Sakyamuni Burkham"" (the name that Polo uses for the Buddha) and St. Josaphat, apparently unaware of the origins of the Josaphat story.
Two Middle High German versions were produced: one, the ""Laubacher Barlaam"", by Bishop Otto II of Freising and another, Barlaam und Josaphat, a romance in verse, by Rudolf von Ems. The latter was described as ""perhaps the flower of religious literary creativity in the German Middle Ages"" by Heinrich Heine.
In the 16th century, the story of Josaphat was re-told as a defence of monastic life during the Protestant Reformation and of free will against Protestant doctrines regarding predestination.

Legend
According to the legend, King Abenner in India persecuted the Christian Church in his realm, founded by the Apostle Thomas. When astrologers predicted that his own son would some day become a Christian, Abenner had the young prince Josaphat isolated from external contact. Despite the imprisonment, Josaphat met the hermit Saint Barlaam and converted to Christianity. Josaphat kept his faith even in the face of his father's anger and persuasion. Eventually Abenner converted, turned over his throne to Josaphat, and retired to the desert to become a hermit. Josaphat himself later abdicated and went into seclusion with his old teacher Barlaam.

Names
In this context, the name Josaphat is derived from the Sanskrit bodhisattva. The Sanskrit word was changed to Bodisav in Middle Persian texts in the 6th or 7th century, then to Būdhasaf or Yūdhasaf in an 8th-century Arabic document (Arabic initial ""b"" ﺑ‎ changed to ""y"" ﻳ‎ by duplication of a dot in handwriting). This became Iodasaph in Georgian in the 10th century, and that name was adapted as Ioasaph (Ἰωάσαφ) in Greece in the 11th century, and then was assimilated to Iosaphat/Josaphat in Latin.
The name Barlaam derives from the Arabic name Bilawhar (بِلَوْهَر) borrowed through Georgian (ბალაჰვარ Balahvar) into Byzantine Greek (Βαρλαάμ Barlaám). The Arabic Bilawhar has historically been thought to derive from the Sanskrit bhagavan, an epithet of the Buddha, but this derivation is unproven and others have been proposed. Almuth Degener suggests derivation from Sanskrit purohita through a hypothetical Middle Persian intermediate.
The name of Josaphat's father, King Abenner, derives from the Greek name Abenner (Ἀβεννήρ), although another Greek version of the legend gives this name as Avenir (Ἄβενιρ). These Greek names were adapted from the Georgian Abeneser (აბენესერ; later shortened to აბენეს, Abenes), which was itself derived from the Arabic version of the legend where he is named King Junaysar (جُنَيسَر). According to I.V. Abuladze, during borrowing from Arabic to Georgian, misplaced i'jām resulted in the misreading of Junaysar as Habeneser, after which the initial H- was omitted. The origin of the Arabic name is unclear.

Sainthood
Feast days
Barlaam and Josaphat were included in earlier editions of the Roman Martyrology with a joint feast day on 27 November, however, they were not included in the Roman Missal. Since 1960 a different Saint, St. Josephat, Bishop and Martyr, has a celebration on 16 November. 
Barlaam and Josaphat were entered into the Greek Orthodox liturgical calendar on 26 August Julian (8 September Gregorian), and into liturgical calendar of the Slavic tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Church, on 19 November Julian (2 December Gregorian).

Texts
There are a large number of different books in various languages, all dealing with the lives of Saints Barlaam and Josaphat in India. In this hagiographic tradition, the life and teachings of Josaphat have many parallels with those of the Buddha. ""But not till the mid-nineteenth century was it recognised that, in Josaphat, the Buddha had been venerated as a Christian saint for about a thousand years."" This was ascertained through the researches of Edouard de Laboulaye and Felix Liebrecht in 1859-1860. The authorship of the work is disputed. The origins of the story may be a Central Asian manuscript written in the Manichaean tradition. This book was translated into Georgian and Arabic.

Greek manuscripts
The best-known version in Europe comes from a separate, but not wholly independent, source, written in Greek, and, although anonymous, attributed to ""John the monk"". It was first attributed to John of Damascus in the 12th century. Although this attribution was attacked in the 19th century, George Ratcliffe Woodward and Harold Mattingly sum up the arguments in favor of John of Damascus' authorship as follows: The work's doctrine is remarkably similar to St. John's, to the point where ""in many passages the resemblance amounts almost to verbal identity""; there are frequent quotations from St. John's favorite authors, such as St. Gregory of Nazianus and St. Basil; ""The defence of images, coupled with the denunciation of Idolatry, the enthusiasm for the monastic ideal, and the scant regard shown for the bishops and the secular clergy, almost compel us to place the work in the time of the Iconoclastic Controversy. The position, taken up and defended, is exactly that of the Icon-venerators; and we regard this fact alone as conclusive evidence for an eighth century date.""; that St. John was often known as ""John the Monk"", so the fact that he wasn't specifically named in the earliest manuscripts doesn't rule him out. 
Nonetheless, many modern scholars do not accept this attribution, citing much evidence pointing to Euthymius of Athos, a Georgian who died in 1028.
The modern edition of the Greek text, from the 160 surviving variant manuscripts (2006), with introduction (German, 2009) is published as Volume 6 of the works of John the Damascene by the monks of the Abbey of Scheyern, edited by Robert Volk. It was included in the edition due to the traditional ascription, but marked ""spuria"" as the translator is the Georgian monk Euthymius the Hagiorite (ca. 955–1028) at Mount Athos and not John the Damascene of the monastery of Saint Sabas in the Judaean Desert. The 2009 introduction includes an overview.

English manuscripts
Among the manuscripts in English, two of the most important are the British Library MS Egerton 876 (the basis for Ikegami's book) and  MS Peterhouse 257 (the basis for Hirsh's book) at the University of Cambridge.
The book contains a tale similar to The Three Caskets found in the Gesta Romanorum and later in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice.

Serbian
""Barlaam and Josaphat"" in the Eastern Orthodox version comes from John of Damascus, copied and translated into Old Church Slavonic by anonymous monk-scribes from the 9th-11th centuries, and in modern Serbian by Ava Justin Popović (""Lives of the Saints"" for November, pp. 563–590), an abridged version of which is given in the Ohrid Prologue of Bishop Nikolaj Velimirović.

Croatian
Three Croatian versions exist, all translations from Italian. The older Shtokavian untitled version originated in the Republic of Ragusa and was transcribed to a codex from an earlier source in the 17th century, while the younger Chakavian translations, one manuscript and one printed, originated in the beginning of the 18th century. The book was published by Petar Maçukat in Venice in 1708 and titled Xivot S[veto]ga Giosafata obrachien od Barlaama and is currently held in the National and University Library in Zagreb. Both manuscripts were published in 1913 by Czech slavist Josef Karásek and Croatian philologist Franjo Fancev and reprinted in 1996. The Chakavian translations had a common source while the older Shtokavian one used an earlier Italian version as well as the Golden Legend.

There are several variant versions, both literary and oral, across the world and its folk elements are classed as Aarne-Thompson-Uther type 1586. The La Fontaine version has been taken as demonstrating various philosophical lessons.

The Fable
The story was introduced to western readers in La Fontaine's Fables (VIII.10). Though L'Ours et l'amateur des jardins is sometimes translated as ""The bear and the amateur gardener"", the true meaning is 'the garden lover'. It relates how a solitary gardener encounters a lonely bear and they decide to become companions. One of the bear's duties is to keep the flies off his friend when he takes a nap. Unable to drive off a persistent fly, the bear seizes a paving stone to crush it and kills the gardener as well. La Fontaine is considered to have been illustrating the Stoic precept that there should be measure in everything, including the making of friends. In terms of practical philosophy, the story also illustrates the important distinction that the bear fails to realise between the immediate good, in this case keeping the flies off a friend, and the ultimate good of safeguarding his welfare.

Several lines occurring in the poem are taken as its morals. Midway there is the statement 'In my opinion it's a golden rule/Better be lonely than be with a fool', which the rest of the story bears out. The summing up at the end carries the commentary given by eastern authors that it is better to have a wise enemy than a foolish friend.
The story gained currency in England from the 18th century on through translations or imitations of La Fontaine. One of its earliest appearances was in Robert Dodsley's Select fables of Esop and other fabulists (1764), where it is given the title ""The Hermit and the Bear"" and provided with the moral ""The random zeal of inconsiderate friends is often as hurtful as the wrath of enemies"". In this version a hermit has done the bear a good turn; later still this was identified with taking a thorn from its paw, drawing on the story of Androcles and the Lion. Serving the hermit afterwards out of gratitude, the bear only strikes him in the face when driving off a fly, and the two then part. It was this milder version that was taken up in early 19th century rhyming editions for children. Among them are Mary Anne Davis' Fables in Verse: by Aesop, La Fontaine, and others, first published about 1818, and Jefferys Taylor's Aesop in Rhyme (1820). Later in the century the origin of the story was forgotten in England and it was taken as one of Aesop's Fables.

Variants
La Fontaine found his fable in a translation of the Bidpai stories, in which the characters are indeed a bear and a gardener. A variant appeared in Rumi's 13th century poem, the Masnavi, which tells the story of a kind man who rescued a bear from a serpent. The animal then devoted itself to its saviour's service and killed him in the manner related.
The story ultimately derives from India, where there are two older versions with different characters. The one from the Panchatantra involves the pet monkey of a king who strikes at the gnat with a sword and causes his master's death. In the Masaka Jataka from the Buddhist scriptures it is a carpenter's foolish son who strikes at a fly on his father's head with an axe. In the former the moral is given as 'Do not choose a fool as a friend', while in the latter it is that 'an enemy with sense is better than a friend without it', which is the sentiment on which La Fontaine closes his fable.
There are yet more variants in the oral tradition. One Pakistani source concerns ""The Seven Wise Men of Buneyr"", who share at least one exploit with the Wise Men of Gotham; imported into it is the episode of causing injury by trying to drive off flies, in this case from an old woman whom one of them knocks over with the stone he throws in doing so. In Europe the story is of a fool who breaks a magistrate's nose with a cudgel in taking vengeance on a fly. In Italy this is told of Giufà, in Austria of Foolish Hans. A similar episode also occurs at the start of Giovanni Francesco Straparola's tale of Fortunio in Facetious Nights (13.4), written about 1550. That particular collection contains the first instance of several other European folk tales, besides this one.

Paintings and prints
Because of the fable's existence in Eastern sources, it has been a particularly popular subject in Muslim miniatures from the East. Most often they depict the bear with the stone raised in its paws, as in the manuscript copy of the Masnavi dating from 1663 in the Walters Art Museum (see above), and another illustration from Persia dating from a little later. A watercolour in Lucknow style, painted by Sital Das round about 1780 and now in the British Library, shows the bear contemplating the gardener after it has killed him. Yet another Indian miniature of the fable was among those commissioned from the Punjabi artist Imam Bakhsh Lahori in 1837 by a French enthusiast of fables. Now in the Musée Jean de la Fontaine, it shows the bear in an ornamental garden.
Several Western artists have illustrated La Fontaine's fable of ""The Bear and the Gardener"", including those like Jean-Baptiste Oudry and Gustave Doré who were responsible for entire editions of La Fontaine's work. On the other hand, Jean-Charles Cazin's 1892 oil painting of L'ours et l'amateur des jardins dispenses with the bear altogether. It is a pure landscape showing a southern farm with the ancient gardener slumbering in the foreground. An etching of this was made by Edmond-Jules Pennequin in 1901. Other series that include the fable are the innovative water colours that Gustave Moreau painted in 1886 and the coloured etchings by Marc Chagall (1951) of which L'ours et l'amateur des jardins is number 83. Finally Yves Alix (1890–1969) produced a lithograph of the fable for a de luxe edition of 20 Fables (1966) incorporating the work of as many modernist artists. During the 19th century, the artist Ernest Griset was one of the many artists who illustrated La Fontaine's fables, and it was his design for this fable that appeared on the 1977 Burundi set of postage stamps with the theme of children's stories, but under the title of L'Ermite et l'Ours.

Idioms
The fable has given to the French language the idiom le pavé de l'ours (the bear's paving stone) and to German Bärendienst (a bear's service), both used for doing somebody or something a disservice or bad turn and sometimes for any ill-considered action with an unfortunate result. The Danish and Norwegian word bjørnetjeneste (bear-service) has similar meanings and the idiom also appears in other European languages.

Folklore
Bhartrhari was the elder son of King Gandharva Sena, who received the kingdom of Ujjain from The celestial god Indra and the King of Dhara.
When Bhartrhari was king of 'Ujjayani' (modern day Ujjain), there lived a Brahman who got the fruit of immortality from the celestial wish granting tree, Kalpavriksha, as a result of long austerity. He decided to offer it to King Bhartrhari. The king wanted his beloved queen, Pinglah or Ananga Sena (as per Maha Kavi Kalidas), to be youthful, and thus gifted her the fruit. Raja Bhartrhari's last and youngest wife. However, the queen had a secret love affair with army chief Mahipaala, she desired him to be immortal and the enchanted fruit was given to him, he in turn passed it to his beloved, 'Lakha' the head mistress. Eventually, the fruit returned to the king. Having completed the circle, the fruit revealed the downsides of infidelity to the king, he summoned the queen and ordered her beheading, and ate the fruit himself. After that he abdicated the throne, to his younger brother Vikramaditya, and became a religious mendicant.
He later became a disciple of Pattinathar (Swetharanyar or Pattinathu chettiyar is poorvashram name of this saint from Poompuhar, Tamil Nadu) who first indulged in an argument about samsari and sanyasi with king Bhartrhari later during the conversation pattinathar said that all women have 'dual mind' and it might be the true case even with parameswari. King conveyed this news to rani Pingalah and she ordered Pattinathar to get punished and to sit in 'kalu maram' (Tree, whose top portion would be sharpened like a pencil and whole tree is fully painted with oil, person who are allowed to sit in the top will split into 2 pieces), they tried pattinathar but kalu maram started burning and nothing happened to Pattinathar, the king came to know this news and went directly to Pattinathar and asked him to get ready to die the next day, but Pattinathar replied I'm ready even now to die. The next day king came with tears in his eyes and released saint from jail because he actually noticed queen pingalah in love with horsemen that night, He threw away his empire, wealth, even his full dress coat and dressed in a simple kovanam (loin cloth). The king became a disciple of Pattinathar and got mukthi (salvation) in the Kalahasthi temple. King Bharthari, or Bhadhragiri (as he is called in popular Tamil folk culture) wrote a collection of Tamil poetic verses called Meignana Pulambal.
There is a very famous song sung by the bards of Chhattisgarh in the memory of Raja Bhartrhari. The story says that Queen Pingala and Raja Bhartrhari did not have a son and the queen was very sad as a result of that. A saint came to the door of their palace one day and asked for alms. When Rani Pinglaa went down to give him alms, he said, ""I know you are sad and I have brought some holy water for you. If you drink this water with faith, you will have a son in twelve months' time."" Rani Pingala had the water and as promised by the Yogi, she had a son after twelve months.
There is one more very interesting story related to Raja Bhartrhari and Rani Pingla. It is said that Raja Bhartrhari was out for a hunt one day and he saw a woman jump into the pyre of her husband as her grief would not let her stay alive. Raja Bhartrhari was moved and this incident stayed in his mind. When he returned to his palace, he told the story to Rani Pingala and asked her if she would do the same. Rani Pingala said that she would die on hearing the news itself and there would be no chance of her staying alive until the funeral ceremony. Raja Bhartrhari decided to test her and went on a hunt once again and sent the news of his death back to the palace. The Mahaaraani died on hearing the news as she had promised and Raja Bhrithari was grief-stricken. Guru Gorakhnath heard about the grief of the King and came to help him overcome his grief. It is said that Guru Gorakhnath created 750 copies of Rani Pingala to demonstrate the illusory nature of the world to Raja Bhartrhari. Even though Rani Pingala was brought back to life, Raja Bharthari decided to renounce the world and became a follower of Guru Gorakhnath. He became a very famous saint and is also known as Sant Bhartrhari by the people of North India. Bhratahari is famous in Alwar of Rajasthan. Ashtami is the worship day celebrated as a festival. The fair of bhratahari is grouped by lakhs of people of Alwar, Jaipur, Dausa near Sariska in Alwar.

Each blind man feels a different part of the animal's body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the animal based on their limited experience and their descriptions of the elephant are different from each other.

Each blind man feels a different part of the animal's body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the animal based on their limited experience and their descriptions of the elephant are different from each other.

The parable
The earliest versions of the parable of blind men and the elephant are found in Buddhist, Hindu and Jain texts, as they discuss the limits of perception and the importance of complete context. The parable has several Indian variations, but broadly goes as follows:

A group of blind men heard that a strange animal, called an elephant, had been brought to the town, but none of them were aware of its shape and form. Out of curiosity, they said: ""We must inspect and know it by touch, of which we are capable"". So, they sought it out, and when they found it they groped about it. The first person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said, ""This being is like a thick snake"". For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan. As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, said, the elephant is a pillar like a tree-trunk. The blind man who placed his hand upon its side said the elephant, ""is a wall"". Another who felt its tail, described it as a rope. The last felt its tusk, stating the elephant is that which is hard, smooth and like a spear.
In some versions, the blind men then discover their disagreements, suspect the others to be not telling the truth and come to blows. The stories also differ primarily in how the elephant's body parts are described, how violent the conflict becomes and how (or if) the conflict among the men and their perspectives is resolved. In some versions, they stop talking, start listening and collaborate to ""see"" the full elephant. In another, a sighted man enters the parable and describes the entire elephant from various perspectives, the blind men then learn that they were all partially correct and partially wrong. While one's subjective experience is true, it may not be the totality of truth.
The parable has been used to illustrate a range of truths and fallacies; broadly, the parable implies that one's subjective experience can be true, but that such experience is inherently limited by its failure to account for other truths or a totality of truth. At various times the parable has provided insight into the relativism, opaqueness or inexpressible nature of truth, the behavior of experts in fields of contradicting theories, the need for deeper understanding, and respect for different perspectives on the same object of observation. In this respect, it provides an easily understood and practical example that illustrates ontologic reasoning.

References in religion
Hinduism
The Rigveda, dated to have been written down (from earlier oral traditions) between 1500 and 1200 BCE, states ""Reality is one, though wise men speak of it variously."" According to Paul J. Griffiths, this premise is the foundation of universalist perspective behind the parable of the blind men and an elephant. The hymn asserts that the same reality is subject to interpretations and described in various ways by the wise. In the oldest version, four blind men walk into a forest where they meet an elephant. In this version, they do not fight with each other, but conclude that they each must have perceived a different beast although they experienced the same elephant. The expanded version of the parable occurs in various ancient and Hindu texts. Many scholars refer to it as a Hindu parable.
The parable or references appear in bhasya (commentaries, secondary literature) in the Hindu traditions. For example, Adi Shankara mentions it in his bhasya on verse 5.18.1 of the Chandogya Upanishad as follows:

etaddhasti darshana iva jatyandhah
Translation: That is like people blind by birth in/when viewing an elephant.

Jainism
The medieval era Jain texts explain the concepts of anekāntavāda (or ""many-sidedness"") and syādvāda (""conditioned viewpoints"") with the parable of the blind men and an elephant (Andhgajanyāyah), which addresses the manifold nature of truth. This parable is found in the most ancient Jain agams before 5th century BCE. Its popularity remained till late. For example, this parable is found in Tattvarthaslokavatika of Vidyanandi (9th century) and Syādvādamanjari of Ācārya Mallisena (13th century). Mallisena uses the parable to argue that immature people deny various aspects of truth; deluded by the aspects they do understand, they deny the aspects they don't understand. ""Due to extreme delusion produced on account of a partial viewpoint, the immature deny one aspect and try to establish another. This is the maxim of the blind (men) and the elephant."" Mallisena also cites the parable when noting the importance of considering all viewpoints in obtaining a full  picture of reality. ""It is impossible to properly understand an entity consisting of infinite properties without the method of modal description consisting of all viewpoints, since it will otherwise lead to a situation of seizing mere sprouts (i.e., a superficial, inadequate cognition), on the maxim of the blind (men) and the elephant.""

Buddhism
The Buddha twice uses the simile of blind men led astray. The earliest known version was recorded in the one of Buddhist scriptures, known as Tittha Sutta.
In another scripture known as Canki Sutta, the Buddha describes a row of blind men holding on to each other as an example of those who follow an old text that has passed down from generation to generation. In the Udana (68–69) he uses the elephant parable to describe sectarian quarrels. A king invited a group of blind men in the capital to be brought to the palace, where an elephant is brought in and they are asked to describe it.

When the blind men had each felt a part of the elephant, the king went to each of them and said to each: ""Well, blind man, have you seen the elephant? Tell me, what sort of thing is an elephant?""
The men assert the elephant is either like a pot (the blind man who felt the elephant's head), a winnowing basket (ear), a plowshare (tusk), a plow (trunk), a granary (body), a pillar (foot), a mortar (back), a pestle (tail) or a brush (tip of the tail).
The men cannot agree with one another and come to blows over the question of what it is like and their dispute delights the king. The Buddha ends the story by comparing the blind men to preachers and scholars who are blind and ignorant and hold to their own views: ""Just so are these preachers and scholars holding various views blind and unseeing.... In their ignorance they are by nature quarrelsome, wrangling, and disputatious, each maintaining reality is thus and thus."" The Buddha then speaks the following verse:

Sufism
The Persian Sufi poet Sanai (1080–1131/1141 CE) of Ghazni (currently, Afghanistan) presented this teaching story in his The Walled Garden of Truth.
Rumi, the 13th Century Persian poet and teacher of Sufism, included it in his Masnavi. In his retelling, ""The Elephant in the Dark"", some Hindus bring an elephant to be exhibited in a dark room. A number of men touch and feel the elephant in the dark and, depending upon where they touch it, they believe the elephant to be like a water spout (trunk), a fan (ear), a pillar (leg) and a throne (back). Rumi uses this story as an example of the limits of individual perception:

The sensual eye is just like the palm of the hand. The palm has not the means of covering the whole of the beast.
Rumi does not present a resolution to the conflict in his version, but states:

The eye of the Sea is one thing and the foam another. Let the foam go, and gaze with the eye of the Sea. Day and night foam-flecks are flung from the sea: oh amazing! You behold the foam but not the Sea. We are like boats dashing together; our eyes are darkened, yet we are in clear water.
Rumi ends his poem by stating ""If each had a candle and they went in together the differences would disappear.""

Meaning as a proverb by language
Japanese
In Japanese, the proverb is used as a simile of circumstance that ordinary men often fail to understand a great man or his great work.

Chinese
In Chinese, the proverb means failure to see the whole picture, for example, due to improper generalization.

Modern treatments
Variants of the story
One of the most famous versions of the 19th century was the poem ""The Blind Men and the Elephant"" by John Godfrey Saxe (1816–1887):

In the poem, each man concluded that the elephant was like a wall, snake, spear, tree, fan or rope, depending upon where they had touched. Their heated debate comes short of physical violence, but the conflict was never resolved.

An elephant joke inverts the story in the following way, with the act of observation severely and fatally altering the subject of investigation:Six blind elephants were discussing what men were like. After arguing they decided to find one and determine what it was like by direct experience. The first blind elephant felt the man and declared, 'Men are flat.' After the other blind elephants felt the man, they agreed.
Moral:

We have to remember that what we observe is not nature in itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.

Commentary
Idries Shah commented on an element of self-reference by readers of the story in one of the many interpretations of the story, and its function as a teaching story:

...people address themselves to this story in one or more [...] interpretations. They then accept or reject them. Now they can feel happy; they have arrived at an opinion about the matter. According to their conditioning they produce the answer. Now look at their answers. Some will say that this is a fascinating and touching allegory of the presence of God. Others will say that it is showing people how stupid mankind can be. Some say it is anti-scholastic. Others that it is just a tale copied by Rumi from Sanai – and so on.
Shah adapted the tale in his book The Dermis Probe. This version begins with a conference of scientists, from different fields of expertise, presenting their conflicting conclusions on the material upon which a camera is focused. As the camera slowly zooms out it gradually becomes clear that the material under examination is the hide of an African elephant. The words 'The Parts Are Greater Than The Whole' then appear on the screen. This retelling formed the script for a short four-minute film by the animator Richard Williams. The film was chosen as an Outstanding Film of the Year and was exhibited at the London and New York film festivals.

In science
The story is seen as a metaphor in many disciplines, being pressed into service as an analogy in fields well beyond the traditional. In physics, it has been seen as an analogy for the wave–particle duality. In biology, the way the blind men hold onto different parts of the elephant has been seen as a good analogy for the polyclonal B cell response or for the reasons why it is challenging to find new drugs to treat diseases such as cancer or Alzheimer's disease. In medicine, the story has also been used to describe situations where diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are treated as several other diseases instead.

In literature
The Russian preface to a collection of Lewis Carroll's works (including such books as A Tangled Tale) includes the story as an analogy to the impression one gets from reading a few articles about Carroll, with him only being seen as a writer and poet by some, and a mediocre mathematician by others. The full picture, however, is that ""Carroll only resembles Carroll the way an elephant only resembles an elephant"".

In media
The story enjoys a continuing appeal in media, as shown by the number of illustrated children's books of the fable; for example, the children's book Seven Blind Mice, by Ed Young (1992) and one by Paul Galdone. In the title cartoon of one of his books, cartoonist Sam Gross postulated that one of the blind men, encountering a pile of the elephant feces, concluded that ""An elephant is soft and mushy.""
Touching the Elephant was a 1997 BBC Radio 4 documentary in which four people of varying ages, all blind from birth, were brought to London Zoo to touch an elephant and describe their response.
Ship of Theseus, a 2012 Indian philosophical drama named after the eponymous thought experiment, also references the parable.
Natalie Merchant sang Saxe's poem in full on her Leave Your Sleep album.

The story underlies certain legends in the West, such as that of Llywelyn and his dog Gelert in Wales, or that of Saint Guinefort in France. It is classified as Aarne-Thompson type 178A.

The story
The original version from the Panchatantra in Sanskrit goes as follows (translation from Ryder 1925):

The Loyal Mongoose
There was once a Brahman named Godly [orig. Devasharma] in a certain town. His wife mothered a single son and a mongoose. And as she loved little ones, she cared for the mongoose also like a son, giving him milk from her breast, and salves, and baths, and so on. But she did not trust him, for she thought: ""A mongoose is a nasty kind of creature. He might hurt my boy."" [...]
One day she tucked her son in bed, took a waterjar, and said to her husband: ""Now, Professor, I am going for water. You must protect the boy from the mongoose."" But when she was gone, the Brahman went off somewhere himself to beg food, leaving the house empty.
While he was gone, a black snake issued from his hole and, as fate would have it, crawled toward the baby’s cradle. But the mongoose, feeling him to be a natural enemy, and fearing for the life of his baby brother, fell upon the vicious serpent halfway, joined battle with him, tore him to bits, and tossed the pieces far and wide. Then, delighted with his own heroism, he ran, blood trickling from his mouth, to meet the mother; for he wished to show what he had done.
But when the mother saw him coming, saw his bloody mouth and his excitement, she feared that the villain must have eaten her baby boy, and without thinking twice, she angrily dropped the water-jar upon him, which killed him the moment that it struck. There she left him without a second thought, and hurried home, where she found the baby safe and sound, and near the cradle a great black snake, torn to bits. Then, overwhelmed with sorrow because she had thoughtlessly killed her benefactor, her son, she beat her head and breast.
At this moment the Brahman came home with a dish of rice gruel which he had got from someone in his begging tour, and saw his wife bitterly lamenting her son, the mongoose. ""Greedy! Greedy!"" she cried. ""Because you did not do as I told you, you must now taste the bitterness of a son’s death, the fruit of the tree of your own wickedness. Yes, this is what happens to those blinded by greed....""

In Western variants of the story, other animals take the place of the mongoose, most often a dog. It is also found in other versions as a weasel, cat (in Persia), bear, or lion, and the snake is sometimes replaced with a wolf (in Wales). The essence of the story, however, remains the same. Similarly, variants of the story sometimes have the man, instead of his wife, killing the loyal animal.
The story is sometimes placed within a frame story, where a saviour stands mistakenly accused and narrates this story, thereby preventing his own death.

Origin and travel
The story was first studied in 1859 by Theodor Benfey, the pioneer of comparative literature, when he compared the versions in India, the Middle East and Europe. In 1884, W. A. Clouston showed how it had reached Wales.

 
Murray B. Emeneau considers the migration of this story, through its steps from India to Wales, as ""one of the best authenticated cases of such diffusions of folk-tales"".  It is classified as Aarne-Thompson type 178A.
The story occurs in all versions of the Panchatantra, as well as the later Sanskrit works Hitopadesha and the Kathasaritsagara. It also occurs in most of the languages of India (and South Asia) where it is extremely familiar. For instance, in the South Indian state of Karnataka, the story occurs as a proverb in inscriptions, as a sculpture in a temple, in narratives of travelling storytellers and singers, and in film. Similarly, the Tamil epic Silappatikaram recalls the story simply by its name.
Like the rest of the Panchatantra, in its westward migration it travelled from Sanskrit to Arabic (as Kalila wa Dimna), Persian, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Old French, and eventually into all the major languages of Europe (as The Fables of Pilpay or Bidpai), ranging from Russian to Gaelic to English. In its eastward migration, it appears in Chinese (ten versions, including in a redaction of the Vinaya Pitaka), and over a wide region from Mongolia to Malaysia. It is also the only story found in all recensions of the Panchatantra, all versions of the ""Book of Sindibad"" (not Sindbad), and all versions of ""The Seven Sages of Rome"".
It is also found in Mexico and the United States. Blackburn observes that the fable is not a dead tradition and is still current, as a Belgian newspaper reported it as an anecdote about a man who left his son and dog in a shopping trolley in his car.
The motif also occurs, with a happy ending, in the Disney film Lady and the Tramp (1955).

Reception and influence
The story is often used in culture as an exemplum cautioning against hasty action. It also serves as shorthand for sin, regret and grief.
In Welsh it became the story of the nobleman Llywelyn who kills his loyal dog, Gelert. It was later interpreted as a legend about a true event, and small shrines to the dog exist in Wales (such as in the village of Beddgelert, ""Gelert's grave""). In France a similar metamorphosis took larger proportions, and the story became the cult of Saint Guinefort (a dog), which was popular until the 1930s.
Blackburn points out that although in the many literary versions it is the man who kills the mongoose, in most oral versions (and the literary version quoted above), it is the woman who does so.

Story
The main story narrates Naravāhanadatta’s progress culminating in his destined enthronement as the emperor of the vidhyādharas, celestial beings with magical abilities, winning twenty-six wives along the way. The surviving manuscripts of the text break off while he is in pursuit of his sixth wife. The narrative is fast-paced and eschews lengthy description.

It is also unusually homogeneous and hasn’t suffered the intrusion of interpolation: Budha·svamin’s laconic style remains consistent throughout. ... Occasional allusions show that Budha·svamin had a thorough grounding in the various sciences that made up the traditional brahmin education ... [and] a wonderfully wide acquaintance with all manner of people and places in the ancient Indian world. The action happens in cities like Ujjayinī [modern Ujjain], Vārānasi [modern Varanasi or Benares], Champa and Madurai, in royal palaces and their harems and parks, in courtesans’ parlours and boudoirs, in merchants’ mansions, caravans and ships, in paupers’ hovels and slums, in outcastes’ villages, in ascetics’ hermitages, in cremation grounds, on festive pilgrimages, in gambling dens and in jungles, mountains and deserts. The incidental descriptions of these places suggest their authors’ personal acquaintance with them.

Somadeva's Kathāsaritsāgara (Ocean of Streams of Story) and Ksemendra's Brhatkathamanjari are other works said ultimately to derive from the same lost Great Story.

Chaar Bayt or Four Stanzas is a form of folklore and performing art. It is still alive today mainly in Rampur (Uttar Pradesh), Tonk (Rajasthan), Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh) and Hyderabad of Telangana (erstwhile Andhra Pradesh). Sangeet Natak Academy recognized it as a traditional folk art form.

Origin
The poetic form traces back to the 7th century in Arabia with the name Rajeez. The origin of the word ""Chaar Bayt"" can be traced back to the Persian language where it refers to a four-stanzas poetry in which each stanza is composed of four lines. The poetry is sung accompanied by Daf, a percussion instrument of Arab origin.
This art form came from Persia to India via Afghanistan. The widely accepted source is the Afghani soldiers in the Mughal army brought this art to India.

Composition
Earlier, it was composed in Persian and Pashtu, however, later it came to be composed in Urdu also. The form gradually became embedded in local culture and began to borrow its idiom from the folk. The ""Chaar Bayt"" poetry exudes the same sensuousness as the Urdu Ghazal.

Present artists groups
Babban Sultani performing group from Rampur in Uttar Pradesh.
Badshah Khan and troupe from Tonk in Rajasthan.
Masood Hashmi and troupe from Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh.
Some local troupes from Hyderabad of Telangana.

Theme of the art
Usually, ""Chaar Bayt"" is a long poem with a chain of four stanzas describing wars, bravery, romance and sometimes spirituality. In earlier periods it has a Sufi mystic spiritual theme, later socio-political issues became the dominant subjects of the theme.

.","""Chauharmal"" or  ""Chuharmal"" or ""Veer Chauharmal"" was a folk hero who was later apotheosized by the members of Dusadh caste. The story of Chauharmal within Dusadh folklore is an empowering message which gives the Dalit community a sense of victory over upper caste Bhumihars and Brahmins 
.

In popular culture
Chauharmal was born in Anjani village, which is located in Patna district. He is described as a devotee of Goddess Durga.
In the folklores of Bihar, various stories of Chauharmal exist. Some of these stories consider him a folk hero of Dusadh community, while other degrade him as an anti-hero. According to the most popular variant, Baba Chauharmal was a chivalrous man of Dusadh caste who used to study along with his Bhumihar friend, Ajab Singh. The father of Ajab Singh was a powerful landlord named Ranjit Singh and his sister was Reshma, who had fallen in one sided love with the Chauharmal who considered her as his sister. Annoyed by the attitude of Chauharmal, Reshma sends an army of his father to defeat Chauharmal and demoralise him. But, Dusadhs performed Rahu Puja and Chauharmal escaped due to the grace of Isht devi (folk goddess) of the Dusadh caste while Reshma was burnt into ashes.
According to another version of the story Chauharmal and Reshma were lovers but their relationship was not supported by her father, who was a powerful landlord of the Bhumihar caste. In order to defeat and assassinate the person who was responsible for letting him down, the father of Reshma sent an army. Chauharmal, who was known for his valour, defeated all of them single-handedly and later assumed ""Samadhi""(meditation) to give up his life himself. Thus, he became popular as a symbol of Dusadh's victory over the landlord Bhumihars.
Reshma is often described in the plays in an abusing and insulting language, highlighting her as a sexual and immoral person. There is a view that lower castes take a vicarious revenge on the Upper castes through this subversion.
The Dusadhs of Mithila region however recognise Sahlesh as their hero, who is said to be uncle of Chauharmal. Sahles was able to take a job as a palace guard (""Mahapour"") in the fort of ""King of Morang"".Chauharmal himself wanted that job and felt cheated. He decided to take revenge but was killed by Sahles. Thus, according to this tradition Sahles is the primary hero while Chauharmal is given secondary status.
The Dalit community also praises Chauharmal and Sahles through various folk songs usually sung in the Bhojpuri language . One of the notable folk song sung in the praise of Chauharmal after Reshma's introduction in his life goes as follows :

Commemoration
The Dusadh celebrate numerous festivals associated with the Chauharmal; the biggest among these being famous ""Chauharmal Mela"", celebrated near Patna. According to Vijay Nambisan, the Dausadh of the region participate with pomp and show in the famous mela to commemorate the popular saint (Chauharmal) who not only fled with an ""upper caste"" girl but also vanquished all her kin. The centre of attraction in this festival remains the participation of Lalu Prasad Yadav. Earlier, such an incident received violent reaction from the Bhumihars but Yadav's participation makes it a rallying point for Dalits.
The celebrations had witnessed violent clashes between the upper and the lower castes in past, the most infamous being the ""Ekauni incident"".The Dalits however organise theatrical performances like ""Rani Reshma ka khela"" to commemorate the whole life of Chauharmal in which various stages of his life are performed by the trained artists. The ritual head of Dusadhs, the Bhagat performs rituals during such occasions.

The art includes drawing tree motifs, flowers, ferns, creepers, plants, peacocks, palanquins, geometric patterns along with vertical, horizontal and oblique lines. These arts add to the festive atmosphere.

Etymology and history
The term chowk-poorana is made up of two words: Chowk means square and poorana means to fill. The art represents folk mud wall art of the Punjab drawn for decoration or festivals.  Hasan (1998) records that during 1849–1949 A.D. decorative designs were painted on mud walls with the occasional bird or animal.  Gall et al. (2009) writing in the Worldmark Encyclopedia of Cultures and Daily Life: Asia and Oceania states that the folk art of Punjab may be thousands of years old, noting similarities between village potters clay toys and Harappan figurines. Women paint intricate designs on mud walls on festivals continuing a long tradition.
Similarly, the Haryana Review (1981) states that artists plaster the mud walls with cow-dung which is then whitewashed.  Lines are then drawn which create symbolic paintings representing ""profit, fortune and prosperity"". The Lalit Kala Akademi  reported in 1968 on how artists in North India draw paintings noting that some artists ""have a special gift for depicting colourful scenes from the epics: some work only in very fine line work in black ink and sindhur (rose-madder)"". In the same publication, the prevalence of wall art on the festival of Sanjhi is described. The festival is celebrated annually during Navratri. Women in northern India comprising the area around Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and the Punjab, plaster the walls and inner courtyards with mud and cowdung. Then geometrical designs are drawn together with circular or triangular clay discs.

Mud wall painting
Kang (1988), in his study of wall art in Punjab, states that the basis of the paintings are to draw circular and triangular shapes which create branches and flowers"". According to Dhillon (1998), women create ""geometrical figures like trees, birds, open hand, geometrical figures like square, triangles, and circles and sometimes abstract designs, human figures and deities"". Aryan (1983) emphasises ""that despite its name, the decorative designs are never drawn on the threshold of the house"" but on the walls. However, according to Kohli (1983), Punjabi women draw chowkpurna ""designs on their thresholds for the well-being and prosperity of their family members as well as to welcome the visitors"".
Bhatti (1981) describes the process employed by artists in Punjab in painting on mud walls. The base is mud and cowdung plaster. The artist uses finger-prints and palm marks for decoration. Chalk, yellow and red clay is used for pigments. Traditional and folk-motifs are drawn on the plaster. Black colour is also utilised.
Dhamija (1971) writes that the wall paintings are drawn with white rice paste. Sometimes ochre (clay) and a few colours are also used. The wall paintings display symbolic ritual designs, which are drawn to ""celebrate special occasions—festivals such as Diwali or Dussehra; happy family celebrations such as birth of a child"". As the art is painted on mud walls, the paintings are drawn twice and perhaps even more times, a year. Sometimes the art can also be seen on brick walls which are plastered with lime. However, the tradition is waning due to cultural changes in the Punjab. Nevertheless, Kang notes in 2018 that in some mud houses, traditional folk art can still be seen on the walls. Similarly, Bedi (1978) notes that during Diwali, women plaster the walls with lime and then draw an image of Lakshmi.
Manku (1986) in his study of Gujjar settlements, states that people in the sub-mountainous region of Punjab people wash the outer and inner walls with white clay called golu. On the inside of the walls, women paint religious motifs with rice powder mixed with water.

Ortta/kandholi
A similar form of folk art is noted by Kang (2019) who states that engraving drawings onto walls was popular when mud houses were common in Punjab. Even after the construction of brick houses, the cooking area in the courtyard was enclosed by a mud wall called an 'Ortta' in Punjabi where women continued to parge motifs on the wall. However, having an Ortta has also declined which has affected the practice of traditional drawing. Kohli (1983) assigns the art of ""parge decoration, in mud, wrought on the walls of houses"" to women. Yellow clay was sometimes used as a base upon which motifs were parged.
An Ortta is also called kandholi (wall) in Punjabi where women would paint drawings. According to Mitawa (2004), the wall would be plastered with coloured clay and then drawn upon using white clay to draw flowers, peacocks and birds. Kehal (2006) notes that shrubs, borders and children's pictures are also drawn on the walls.

Wall art on festivals
In Punjab, images are painted on walls on festivals such as Sanjhi and Hoi. A local festival on Navratri is observed whereby wheat or barley are planted on the first day and the seedlings are immersed in water on Dussehra. The seedlings are placed before an image of a Goddess on the wall. Similarly, images are painted on festive occasions in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.

Floor art
According to ""A dictionary of the Panjabi language prepared of the Lodiana mission"" in 1854, in Punjab, chowk-poorana refers to preparing the square on the floor with flour on weddings and dedications. In religious ceremonies, symbols are drawn for worshipping.  Some of the symbols used in Hindu ceremonies include drawing planets and Om. This is similar to the floor art, chowk-poorana, in Uttar Pradesh where pots are placed in the middle and the art is drawn around them in religious ceremonies.
 In Uttar Pradesh, the alternative name is Sona Rakhna.
In the Punjab, the chowk square is drawn on the floor with flour and turmeric. Sometimes a swastika is also drawn in the square. Such drawings are made before weddings or when the mother of a new born child goes outdoors for the first time. Other festive occasions include the bringing of horses/cows home for the first time. Modern squares are more colourful and use rice.
Aryan (1983) in his study of Punjab folk art writes that the floral and geometrical designs are drawn on mud walls and in courtyards using ""powdered colours or earth colours such as white, ultrarine Heel and Indian red Gerua"". The patterns are created using a piece of rag. The patterns tend to be simple as compared to the intricate designs of mandana paintings in Rajasthan and Gujarat. Bedi (2001) describes a chowk depicting the planets. However, such a chowk forms part of religious ceremonies and is worshiped.
Floor art of the western Himalaya region, comprising Jammu, parts of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, is called likhnoo or dehar but it is also called chowk which has its own style of designs. In the lower ridges of Jammu and Himachal Pradesh,  which Jerath (1971) called the Dogra region, floor art is termed chowka poorna.

Phulkari chowk
According to Bedi (2001), sometimes chowk poorana is drawn in Punjabi courtyards using flour and colours. The designs drawn are the motifs embroidered on phulkaris. Green is used for the branches and leaves, and white, red and yellow is used for the flowers. Such chowk is called the phulkari chowk. Bedi states that there are different types of chowk but the starting point is a square made with flour. However, any design can be made within the square such as circles or triangular shapes. Dots are drawn using red sindoor (vermilion).

Process
Bajpai (2015) in her study of ""Brocade and chowkpurana craft and art of Uttar Pradesh prospects for their sustainability"" reports of the process of creating chowk poorana floor art in Uttar Pradesh. She states that the night before painting the mud walls, geru is mixed with water to be spread over walls and the floor. Rice is soaked in water on the day of the painting, then finely ground and mixed with water. Geru is ""spread in a square or rectangular shape depending on the occasion and after that the design was drawn."" Women draw sketches using dots to draw the outline which would then be connected with lines using chalk powder on wet ground, or rice paste on dry surface. Bajpai further states that floor and wall art is practised in Uttar Pradesh on mud and bricks. The art is drawn on religious and social occasions. In Uttar Pradesh,  chowk means ""auspicious area of home” whereas purana means  ""drawing on floor/wall.""  Some of the festivals when chowk art is drawn include Raksha Bandhan, Devthan Puja and Holi. The tradition has been passed from mother to daughter. However, Bajpai notes that the younger generation is influenced by television in the designs more than the older women who practice traditional art work peculiar to Uttar Pradesh, having not seen the folk designs of other states of India.
Although the floor art of the western Himalaya region, comprising Jammu and Himachal Pradesh, is called likhnoo, it is also called chowk or chowka poorna. According to Tadvalkar (2011), in the mountainous region, it is common for women to draw  ""folk paintings on the floors, thresholds, walls, grain stores, ritual places etc."" The process involves sweeping the floor and then plastering it with cow-dung which, once it begins to dry, is then smoothed with a round stone.  Sometimes women create foliated borders using finger-tips on the wet coating. The patterns are termed hangaiyan. Tadvalkar (2011) states that the ""cow-dunging process is known as lipna in the region, whereas the floor art is referred to as likhnoo (writing), dehar (with respect to dehali, the threshold) or chowk"". The background is painted with brown coloured earth (loshti). Materials used to paint include rice or wheat flour paste or white earth known as golu or makol. Tadvalkar further states that women draw floral motifs such as the lotus and rose and also pointed geometrical figures. Colours are used. This type of floor art is called phullchittarana. Such floor art is drawn on various occasions including festivals.
Similarly, Gupta (2020) in her research paper Chauk poorna Uttar Pradesh ki lok sanskriti ka strot ek vivechan, also explains that the art of Chowk Purana in Uttar Pradesh is practiced by women on festivals and happy occasions. Gupta also describes a specific type of Chowk art. When art is drawn at the threshold of a house on a wedding, the art is called chetrau or chiteri which incorporates an image of Ganesh. The colours used to draw a chiteri included yellow, blue and green.

According to the folklore, a female spirit as Chudail composed verses from his lover.","Chud Vijogan is a folklore from Saurashtra region of Gujarat, India. According to the folklore, a female spirit as Chudail composed verses from his lover.

Folklore
In Okha-Barda region or some town in Saurashtra, a Sindhi girl was in love with Amiyal, a son of a townchief or a minister. But when she was married to a different prince, she lived out of town alone under pretext of a vow and continued her love affair with Amiyal. When the prince came to know about it, he killed the girl. She was reborn as a Chudail and continued her affair with Amiyal who was unaware of it. When he come to know the truth, he left her and went to Girnar hill. The Chudail found him and hated him for leaving her.

Verses
According to one opinion, Amiyal is a name of Sindhi girl while according to other, her name is Chud. According to an opinion, Chud is derived from Chudail, a female spirit. About hundred verses, with or without name, are found regarding this folklore. These verses include Sindhi words too. Most verses have six stanza but some have less. Based on subject and style, Sindhi Muslim verse writer Tamachi Sumra is suggested as a possible writer.
These verses are primarily directed to lover or about love. The subjects include arrival, departure, dream and bereavement. It also advises on love to whom and not. It also describes materials from folk life.
Jhaverchand Meghani notes these verses in ""Sajna"" chapter in his Gujarati book Parkamma. This folklore is also an origin of his Gujarati story ""Olipo"".

Although it has similarities with other fables where a predator flatters a bird, such as The Fox and the Crow and Chanticleer and the Fox, in this one the cock is the victor rather than victim. There are also Eastern variants of this story.

Versions of the fable
In the Greek story, a cock and a dog go on a journey together. At night, the cock roosts in a tree while the dog curls up at its roots. When the cock crowed in the morning, it attracted a fox that made friendly overtures and tried to lure the bird down. The cock agrees, telling it to ask the porter to open the door so that it can come out. The fox stumbles on the sleeping dog and is killed.
An ancient Indian variant of the theme appeared in the Buddhist scriptures as the Kukuta-Jataka. Here a predatory cat, having killed all the other fowls, tries to woo the cock down with a promise of marriage, but he is not to be deceived and denounces the cat for its former slaughter. In its journey westwards, the tale was eventually included in The Thousand and One Nights and was translated by Richard F. Burton as The Pleasant History of the Cock and the Fox. This version, enlarged by the fox's many flights of rhetoric, recounts how the beast tries to lure the cock down from a wall with the news that universal friendship has been declared between the hunters and the hunted. The cock refuses even to acknowledge the fox's fine words but finally announces that he is convinced for he can see greyhounds running towards them who must be messengers from the King of the Beasts. When the agitated fox starts to leave, the cock asks him the reason; the fox replies that he fears the dogs were not present when the peace was announced.
This version of the story was an influence on the fable's retelling in Europe. It is to be found early among the humorous tales of  Poggio Bracciolini's Facetiae (1450), where the fleeing fox explains only that the dogs have not yet heard that peace has been declared. In France the story reappeared in the first book of emblems of Guillaume Gueroult (1550). There the fable is told at length and it is explained that the suspicious cock has invented his report of the approaching hounds because he distrusts the fox. The telling is prefaced with the summary of the fable's meaning: ""To the trickster comes a trickster and a half"" (A trompeur, trompeur et demi). When Jean de la Fontaine retold the story as Le coq et le renard (II.15), he underlined his use of Geroult by concluding with a moral that echoed his source: ""Pleasure is doubled in tricking the trickster"" (c'est double plaisir de tromper le trompeur).
The Greek and the Oriental versions of the fable were soon to be confounded together. In Francis Barlow's illustrated edition of the fables (1687), Aphra Behn's English verse summary tells the Eastern tale with the cock concluding that ""I'le not my strength forgoe, If true today, tomorrow 'twill be so."" The accompanying Latin prose summary, on the other hand, follows Aesop's account but concludes that treachery is to be met with treachery.

Artistic interpretations
There is a carving of ""The Cock and the Cat"" from the Bharhut stupa, dating from 150 BCE, which is now displayed in the Indian Museum in Calcutta. Aesop's fable can be found on household china in Europe, but it is not always clear whether the story of ""Chanticleer and the Fox"" is meant instead without the appearance of the dog as well. The dog occupies the foreground on an 18th-century ornamental dessert dish from the Chelsea porcelain factory, while in Marc Chagall's 1952 series of etchings, which are of La Fontaine's fables, the dog is shown running in from the distance.
La Fontaine's version of the fable has also been set by several composers:

Louis Lacombe, as the third in his Fables de La Fontaine (Op. 72 1875)
Jean Françaix for solo or chorus and piano (1963)
Guy Reibel for wind instrument and three equal voices (1996)
Lucian Cristofor Tugui in 2006

He is also called Makhan chor or butter thief. The neighbours would try to avert his mischief by hanging the pots high out of his reach, but Krishna would find creative ways to reach them.

Significance and description
In Maharastra, Janmashtami is celebrated as Dahi Handi (dahi: curd, handi: earthen pot) It is organized roughly every August. The festival Gokulashtami, known as Krishna Janmashtami in the rest of the country, is the celebration of Krishna's birth and Dahi Handi is part of it. The event involves making a human pyramid and breaking an earthen pot filled with milk, curd, butter, fruits and water which is hung at a convenient height, thus imitating the actions of child Krishna. Sometimes the prize money is added to the pot instead.
The terms govinda (also another name of Krishna) or govinda pathak are used to refer to the people who participate in forming this human pyramid. They practise in groups weeks before the actual event. These groups are called mandals and they go around the local areas, attempting to break as many pots as possible during the event. Pyramid formation needs coordination and focus; the lowest layers consist of the most people, preferably sturdy, while the middle layer players need to pay attention to those below as well as those standing on their shoulders. The outer layer individuals need to focus on maintaining balance. As lighter people are needed higher up, the topmost layer usually has a single child. Breaking the pot usually ends up with the contents spilling over the participants. Traditionally, spectators throw water on the participants to deter them and people chant in Marathi ""Ala re ala, Govinda ala"" (govindas have arrived). The pyramid formation is often accompanied by crowds, music and dancing.
In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana this festival is celebrated as Utlotsavam (In Telugu Utti: a fibrous network sling to hang pots and Utsavam: Festival). At the famous Tirupati Venkateswara Temple, this ancient sport is celebrated with great fervor on navami (the day after krishna janmastami). The processional deities of Sri Krishna Swamy and Sri Malayappa Swamy are taken in a procession around the temple to the place just in-front of temple where Utlotsavam is performed. The sport is played in front of the deities by local youth to try and win the prize money which is tied to the end of a 25 foot long wooden post, smeared with sticky and other oily substances.

Celebration and economics
The participants form a pyramid consisting usually below 9-tiers, and are given three attempts to break the earthen pot. Every year thousands of people and hundreds of govinda teams gather at Pune, Mumbai and Thane's Dahi Handi events. As of 2011, the prize money for the events usually range between ₹1 lakh (US$1,100)–₹12 lakh (US$14,000) depending on the organizers and its sponsors. Each year, the prizes and scale of the celebrations increase due to the participation of political parties and commercialisation.
Local and state political parties like the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP),  Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), are active during this event, with each offering their own prize money. Each party sponsors its own set of mandals. Their involvement has increased in the 2000s, thereby increasing competition and prize money. Thus, numerous teams compete against each other in successive events for the prizes throughout the city. Actors from Bollywood, Marathi actors and singers  take part in this event. Some mandals even incorporated social messages like female foeticide or about the environment into their act; the Shiv Sena and MNS focus on Marathi culture. Some years, Castellers from Catalonia also take part in the competition.

In 2012, a mandal called Jai Jawan Govinda Pathak from Jogeshwari, Mumbai, made an entry into the Guinness World Record by forming a human pyramid of 9 tiers 43.79 feet (13.35 m) at the Dahi Handi event held in Thane; the previous record was held by Spain since 1981. A lobby pushed for the possibility of making it an official sport in the same year, while critics said that it should remain just a street celebration.
In 2008 a mandal known as Mazgaon Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Mandal made the first ever 9-tier human pyramid in India at Vartak Nagar Thane.
The Mazgaon area is also known as a Dahi Handi Chi Pandhari as they have maintained and followed all the rituals for a long period of time. Also the Mazgaon Tadwadi Govinda Pathak made the first ever 6-tier, 7-tier and 8- tier pyramids.

Issues
The presence of these mass celebrations and mandals cause traffic congestion and problems like excessive littering. It also causes the issue of sound pollution, with the Supreme Court of India's prescribed guidelines being 55–65 decibels.
Participation carries a high risk of mortality. The number of injuries increased due to higher competition since 2000. A report in 2012 from the Journal of Postgraduate Medicine, concluded that ""There is a considerable risk of serious, life-threatening injuries inherent to human pyramid formation and descent in the Dahihandi festival"". It recommended safety guidelines like reducing the height of the pot, preventing children from participating and using safety gear.
In 2012, over 225 govindas were injured with one casualty; this was higher than the previous year's 205. The government of Maharashtra banned children below 12 years from participating in 2014. The Bombay High Court later ruled in August that the minimum age should be raised to 18 years and height of the pyramid should be no more than 20 feet due to safety reasons. The Supreme Court of India refused to clarify the Bombay High Court thereby upholding it, but various organizations have re-appealed on different legal grounds. They state that olympic sports are dangerous and cause injuries too, but that is not sufficient grounds to ban Olympic participation. Banning a religious tradition, they state, infringes on the religious rights of a particular community. Several parties have defied the ban.

Reception
Sammohinee Ghosh of Mid-day, a Mumbai daily, states that ""Kushalappa’s writing strikes the reader through its detailed and in-depth research.""
Shweta Sharan of the Mint, a New Delhi-based publication under HT Media, states, ""Keen to retell and document fables and myths from India, Nitin Kushalappa MP has collected 15 fantastic folk tales from South India in his latest book, 'Dakshin: South Indian Myths and Fables Retold'. Published by Puffin (an imprint of Penguin Random House India), the book is filled with tales of evil sorcerers, gods, goddesses, fairies, animals, village folk, hunters, kings, and queens.""
Author C P Belliappa writes in Star of Mysore, ""In retelling these stories, Nitin has given them a new flavour with his distinctive writing style... Each of the stories takes the reader on a whirlwind of fantasy.  By the time the story peaks the reader is drawn into the vortex of the tale wondering what comes next.  Every story invariably has an unexpected ending. And every story has a moral. The book is targeted at children nine years and older.  It’s a collection that can be enjoyed by young adults, adults, and senior citizens as well... The book is on its way to becoming a classic. ""
Md. Faizan Moquim wrote about the book in The Book Review in November 2023. He says that, ""Kushalappa’s skillful narration keeps the reader anticipating the next twist and provides ample occasion to relish the world of folklore. The author, however, does not attempt to tease out differences between fables, myths, and folktales. A note toward this end in the introduction would have added clarity to these seemingly interchangeable terms for the young readers... Kushalappa’s retelling is certainly bound to inspire readers to find new horizons of meaning."" Dakshin was shortlisted for the 2023 Atta Galatta-Bangalore Literature Festival Book Prize in the children's fiction category.

The story is catalogued as type 52 in the Aarne-Thompson classification system.

The story from the East
The version of the story found in the Indian Panchatantra concerns a lion who is persuaded that the cure for his sickness is the ears and heart of an ass. His servant the jackal persuades an ass to accompany him but the lion is too weak to kill the ass on the first attempt and the jackal has to trick it into returning. Afterwards the jackal persuades the hungry lion to leave him with the dead ass and takes the ears and heart for himself. His explanation for their absence is that so silly an animal cannot have had the equipment to hear or to think with.
The story travelled westwards through a series of translations and adaptations and was eventually carried to Spain by invading Arabs. By this time the details of the story had altered considerably. In one Arab version an ass demands toll of the lion and is killed for this effrontery. The heart is eaten by a fox who says it could never have existed in so stupid an animal. There also exist Jewish versions of the story, in one of which the ass figures as toll-keeper and in the other demands a fare on board ship.

The story from the West
The story of ""The Lion, the Fox and the Deer"" is an ancient one that first appeared in the poetry of Archilochus and was told at great length in the collection of Babrius. In this the fox twice persuades the deer to visit the lair of a lion too sick to hunt, on the first occasion escaping with an injured ear; the fox explains this as a rough caress and the deer returns to its death. It was only recorded in Greek, so that Mediaeval European variants may equally be of Eastern rather than Western origin. Thus in Marie de France's telling, the lion requires the deer's heart as a cure for its illness, as in the Panchatantra.
The very different version in her contemporary, Berechiah ha-Nakdan's ""Fox Fables"", appears to owe something to a Latin poem by Avianus, numbered 583 in the Perry Index. In this a boar has its ears cut off as a punishment for roaming in the fields of an estate and later pays for it with his life. A thieving peasant explains the missing heart to his master in the usual way. But in Berechiah's telling the wild boar trespasses in the royal lion's garden and, after losing its ears and eyes in punishment, is finally killed and the heart is stolen by the fox. These final details demonstrate a synthesis with other versions of the fable, of which there appear to be many by this time. A still later Spanish version by Juan Ruiz, involves a musical ass who keeps the lion awake with his discordant music and in this case loses his heart and ears to the wolf.
The process of transformation continues into modern times. In Stuart Croft's 12-minute film The Stag without a Heart (2009/10), the story is recounted at length in an endlessly circuitous version by having the fox replace the heart it has stolen in the deer as a means of persuading it to return to the lion's presence.

The Rajasthani version is entirely different from a version found in Chhattisgarh. The folktale can also be found in Punjab.

Literature
The Dhola Maru story is deeply rooted in folklore and oral traditions. The story related work is available in prose and poetry as well as in mixed form also. 'Dhola Maru ri chaupai' a book composed by Jain monk Kushallabh in 1617, in which he writes that the story is old one. Some manuscripts of 1473 also describe the story. 'Dhola Maru ra doha' is the edited text by Kashi nagari Pracharini sabha. The tale depicts one of the most mesmerizing chapters of Rajput and rajasthani history.

Story
Rajasthani version
This is a love story of Kachhwaha prince Dhola of Narwar and Poogal princess Maru. King Pingal lived in a small kingdom, Poogal. One day he decided to have his infant daughter Maru married off to Dhola, the son of Nal, the king of Narwar and his good friend. So Dhola and Maru got married at childhood (now illegal) but before they attained adulthood Nal died, and Dhola forgot the marriage vows he had exchanged with Maru at birth. So Dhola got married again to Malwani, while Maru pined away for him as her father king Pingal sent umpteen messages to Dhola which he never received as his wife Malwani had all the messengers either arrested or bumped off.
But Maru got through to Dhola finally through a group of folk singers, and Dhola on learning about his first wife started off for Poogal immediately. However the cunning Malwani was not going to let both lovers meet if she could help it. As Dhola set off she sent word through a messenger that she had died and Dhola ought to hurry back. Dhola ,not oblivious of the ways of Malwani , saw the lie for what it was and carried on. His journey to Poogal was uneventful apart from an inopportune encounter with Umar Sumar, the leader of a band of robbers who tried to persuade him that his wife Maru had been married off to somebody else. Umar Sumar was himself very keen on Maru, but Dhola was having none of it. He arrived at Poogal to a tumultuous welcome and Dhola Maru were united at last. Troubles were not over yet.
On the way back to Narwar, Maru was stung by a desert snake and died. Overwhelmed with grief Dhola decide to become the first ‘male sati’ in Rajput history by ascending the funeral pyre of his wife. But was saved in the nick of time by a yogi and yogini who claimed that they could bring Maru back to life. They played their musical instruments and brought back Maru to life. Umar Sumar once again enters the scene. He hadn’t rid himself of his infatuation for Maru and invited the gullible couple to spend an evening with them. However they were again warned of the dacoit’s evil intentions, this time by some folk singers. Whereupon the couple jumped atop their camel and made off for Malwa in double quick time and the couple along with Malwani lived happily ever after.

Chhattisgarhi version
In the Chhattisgarh version, Dhola is the son of king Nal and mother Damyanti. In his past life Dhola was a handsome young man who was catching fish in the village pond through angle called 'gari' in Chhattisgarhi. Rewa, an exceptionally beautiful woman, who was daughter-in-law of some family in the village in her past life, came to fetch water seven times, expecting Dhola at least to say a word to her. However, when getting no response from Dhola, she broke her silence by reciting following verse which rhymes:

Dhola replied:

This reply pierced Rewa's heart like an arrow and filled it with ocean of remorse. Struck by heart-pinching reply, and rejection, she returned to her home and committed suicide by jumping into the well in her family garden called kola in Chhattisgarhi. When her soul reaches heaven, she is confronted by God there as to how come she returned to heaven before completing her actual duration of life-span. She narrates her story of being rejected by Dhola. So God asked her what she wanted. Rewa replied that she wanted Dhola to be her husband. In reply to her request, God said that Dhola is already destined to be husband of Maaru, and thus Rewa cannot have Dhola as her husband for the life-time but only for 12 years. And the story turns to after-birth of Dhola, Maaru and Rewa, where Dhola and Maaru are married in the childhood.
Mother Damyanti keeps warning her son Dhola that he can go to roam around every para (caste-based locality) of the village except Malhin para (Malhin is the caste which sell flower and their main profession is gardening). However, Dhola does not listen to her and goes to roam around Malhin para and is there confronted by a parrot who challenges him by saying:

Dhola could not stop his anger, and using his catapult, hit the parrot. The parrot dies immediately and to his surprise appeared an exceptionally beautiful lady who owned this parrot. This lady was Rewa and the parrot was creation of her magic. She insisted that her parrot be made alive again otherwise Dhola has to live with her at her home. Rewa's father, Hiriya Malhin, and others in the village tried to convince her to let go the matter, but it was of no accord. Dhola is lovingly imprisoned at Rewa's house and started living as her Mister.
Meanwhile, Maaru reaches her age of youth and started missing Dhola. She sends various messages to Dhola through parrot and later through Dharhee (probably a human messenger). But both of these messengers were intercepted by Rewa through her Chhachhand (Eagle) and by other means. Finally, Maaru sends the Karhaa (a camel given to her by her parents as wedding gift). Karhaa managed to reach the village of Rewa, but was struck to sickness through magic of Rewa and lives in swamp area for twelve years and thirteen Poornimas (fortnights).
Maaru's geeyan [formal female friend] is married to one businessman (Baniya) in the town of Narour (most likely present day Nandour-Kalan, Chhattisgarh) where Dhola lives with Rewa. She had recently visited her maayka (maternal home) at Pingla (most likely one of suburb of Malhar, Chhattisgarh) and met her friend Maaru who had given her a love-letter to be delivered to Dhola. Maaru had requested that this letter should not be read by anyone other than Dhola as this has some very personal details which she wanted to share only with Dhola. On the eve of Vijay Dashmi (i.e. Navami before Dussehra), this friend of Maaru was combing her long hairs and watching out through the window. The Baniya was making some accounting report sitting nearby. The lady hears a weeping-sound in the midst of the drum-sound of Navami Dussehra celebrations. She asks her husband as to who are those people who might be weeping amidst celebration. Her husband replies that those people are king Nal and his wife Damyanti, who in their old age are wondering as to who will roam through city streets on chariot and receive the johar (greetings) on the behalf king from the citizens of Narour city as their only son Dhola is under house arrest at Rewa's palace. She immediately remembers of the letter that Maaru had given and requests her husband to deliver it to Dhola. But Dhola Kuwar is never allowed to go out. However, as the 12 years with Rewa are about to end; Dhola too feels a sense of uneasiness within and resolves to go out to receive the Johar. After multiple requests, Rewa gives in and agrees for Dhola's visit outside her home but puts a condition that she will also accompany him in khadkhadiya chariot (small chariot tied behind to a bigger chariot). Dhola convinces her that by seeing Rewa behind his chariot, everyone in the village will laugh at him and make jibes about his manhood and kingly authority. So finally Rewa agrees to stay at home and Dhola Kuwar is allowed to go out to receive johar on the occasion of Dussehra. Baniya was just looking for this opportunity to meet Dhola Kuwar somehow.

Folk theatre
In Rajasthani folk theatre popularity of Dhola-Maru tradition is very high. The folk theatre of Rajasthan 'Khyal' belongs to one of the least researched areas of the arts in this region.

In popular culture
The folktale has been adapted into the Indian films: Dhola Maru (1956) by N. R. Acharya, Dhola Maru (1983) by Mehul Kumar.

Summary
A merchant, after many years of poverty and hard work, moved to a distant region and grew rich. He decided to go home. A man told him that his road was beset by thieves, and the merchant left his box of jewels with him until he could get men of his own family to accompany him. When he returned, the man denied that it had ever happened, and threw him out of the shop.
Kooshy Ram saw him sitting on the road, and asked him what had happened. Then he told him to go back the next day, and ask for his box when someone gave him a signal. While he was waiting, a palanquin arrived, and the man was told that a lady wished to leave her boxes of jewels with him, for safety. While the talk was still going on, the merchant received the signal and came to ask. The man decided that it would put off the lady, and handed over the box. The merchant started to dance in the street. A message arrived that her husband had come, so she did not need to deposit the jewels after all. Then Kooshy Ram burst out of the palanquin and joined the merchant. Then the man joined them.
Someone said that the merchant had recovered his jewels, that Kooshy Ram had tricked him, but that the man had no reason to dance. He said that he had thought he had learned every way to trick people, but now he knew another.

Sahasodgata-avadāna, in the opening paragraphs, describe the Buddha's instructions for creating the bhavacakra (wheel of life).
Rudrāyaṇa-avadāna explains how the Buddha gave the first illustration of the Buddha to King Rudrayaṇa. According to this story, at the time of the Buddha, King Rudrayana (a.k.a. Udayana (king) ) offered a gift of a jeweled robe to King Bimbisara of Magadha. King Bimbisara was concerned that he did not have anything of equivalent value to offer as a gift in return. Bimbisara went to the Buddha for advice, and the Buddha gave instructions to have the first drawing of the Buddha himself send the drawing to Rudrayana. It is said that Rudrayana attained realization through seeing this picture.

The Greek language original was retold in Latin and in this way was spread across Europe, teaching the lesson to be contented with what one has and not to relinquish substance for shadow. There also exist Indian variants of the story. The morals at the end of the fable have provided both English and French with proverbs and the story has been applied to a variety of social situations.

The fable
A dog that is carrying a stolen piece of meat looks down as it is walking beside or crossing a stream and sees its own reflection in the water. Taking that for another dog carrying something better, it opens its mouth to attack the ""other"" and in doing so drops what it was carrying. An indication of how old and well-known this story was is given by an allusion to it in the work of the philosopher Democritus from the 5th century BCE. Discussing the foolish human desire for more, rather than being content with what one has, he describes it as being ""like the dog in Aesop's fable"".
Many Latin versions of the fable also existed and eventually the story became incorporated into mediaeval animal lore. The Aberdeen Bestiary, written and illuminated in England around 1200 (see above), asserts that ""If a dog swims across a river carrying a piece of meat or anything of that sort in its mouth, and sees its shadow, it opens its mouth and in hastening to seize the other piece of meat, it loses the one it was carrying"".

Versions
Although the outlines of the story remain broadly similar, certain details became modified over time. The fable was invariably referred to in Greek sources as ""The dog carrying meat"" after its opening words (Κύων κρέας φέρουσα), and the moral drawn there was to be contented with what one has. Latin sources often emphasised the fact that the dog was taken in by its own reflection (simulacrum) in the water, with the additional moral of not being taken in by appearances.
Other words used to mean reflection have contributed to the alternative title of the fable, ""The Dog and its Shadow"". In the Latin versions of Walter of England, Odo of Cheriton and Heinrich Steinhöwel's Aesop, for example, the word umbra is used. At that time it could mean both reflection and shadow, and it was the latter word that was preferred by William Caxton, who used Steinhöwel's as the basis of his own 1384 collection of the fables. However, John Lydgate, in his retelling of the fable earlier in the century, had used ""reflexion"" instead. In his French version of the story, La Fontaine gave it the title Le chien qui lâche sa proie pour l'ombre (The dog who relinquished his prey for its shadow VI.17), where ombre has the same ambiguity of meaning.
Thereafter, and especially during the 19th century, the English preference was to use the word shadow in the fable's title. By this time, too, the dog is pictured as catching sight of himself in the water as he crosses a bridge. He is so represented in the painting by Paul de Vos in the Museo del Prado, dating from  1638/40, and that by Edwin Henry Landseer, which is titled ""The Dog and the Shadow"" (1822), in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Critics of La Fontaine had pointed out that the dog could not have seen its reflection if it had been paddling or swimming across the stream, as described in earlier sources, so crossing by a bridge would have been necessary for it to do so. However, a bridge had already been introduced into the 12th-century Norman-French account of Marie de France and Lydgate was later to follow her in providing that detail. Both also followed a version in which it is a piece of cheese rather than meat that the dog carries.

Indian analogues
A story close to Aesop's is inserted into the Buddhist scriptures as the Calladhanuggaha Jataka, where a jackal bearing a piece of flesh walks along a river bank and plunges in after the fish it sees swimming there. On returning from its unsuccessful hunt, the jackal finds a vulture has carried off its other prey. A variation deriving from this is the story of ""The Fox and the Piece of Meat"" ascribed to Bidpai. There a fox is on its way home with the meat when it catches sight of some chickens and decides to hunt one of them down; it is a kite that flies off with the meat left behind in this version.

Proverbial morals
In his retelling of the story, Lydgate had drawn the lesson that the one ""Who all coveteth, oft he loseth all"", He stated as well that this was ""an olde proverb"" which, indeed, in the form ""All covet, all lose"", was later to be quoted as the fable's moral by Roger L'Estrange.
Jean de la Fontaine prefaced his version of the fable with the moral it illustrates before proceeding to a brief relation of the story. The point is not to be taken in by appearances, like the dog who attacks his reflection and falls into the water. As he struggles to swim to shore, he relaxes his grip on his plunder and loses ""shadow and substance both"". An allusive proverb developed from the title: Lâcher sa proie pour l'ombre (giving up the prey for the shadow).
When this idiom was glossed in a dictionary of gallicisms, however, it was given the English translation, ""to sacrifice the substance for the shadow"", which is based on the equally proverbial opposition between shadow and substance found in English versions of the fable. Aphra Behn, in summing up Francis Barlow's 1687 illustrated version of ""The Dog and Piece of Flesh"", coalesced the ancient proverb with the new:

The wishing Curr growne covetous of all.
To catch the Shadow letts the Substance fall.
In Roger L'Estrange's relation of ""The Dog and a Shadow"", ""He Chops at the Shadow and Loses the Substance""; Brooke Boothby, in his translation  of the fables of Phaedrus, closes the poem of ""The Dog and his Shadow"" with the line ""And shade and substance both were flown"". The allusive proverb is glossed as ""Catch not at shadows and lose the substance"" in a recent dictionary.
One other author, Walter Pope in his Moral and political fables, ancient and modern (1698), suggested that the alternative proverb, ""A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"", could be applied to the dog's poor judgment.

Alternative applications
16th-century emblem books used illustrations in order to teach moral lessons through the picture alone, but sometimes found pictorial allusions to fables useful in providing a hint of their meaning. So in his Book of Emblemes (1586), the English poet Geoffrey Whitney gives to his illustration of the fable the Latin title Mediocribus utere partis (Make use of moderate possessions) and comments in the course of his accompanying poem,

Whome fortune heare allottes a meane estate,
Yet gives enowghe eache wante for to suffise:
That wavering wighte, that hopes for better fate,
And not content, his cawlinge doth despise,
Maie vainlie clime, but likelie still to fall,
And live at lengthe with losse of maine and all.
Others also treated the subject of being content with what one already has in an emblematic way. They include Latin versions of the fable by Gabriele Faerno, whose De Canis & Caro warns not to prefer the uncertain to the sure (Ne incerta certis anteponantur); Hieronymus Osius, with his comment that the more some folk have, the more they want (Sunt, qui possideant cum plurima, plura requirunt); and Arnold Freitag, who points out the stupidity of changing the sure for the uncertain (Stulta certi per incertum commutatio). At a later date the financial implications of ""throwing good money after bad"" for uncertain gain were to be summed up in the English phrase ""It was the story of the dog and the shadow"".
The fable was also capable of political applications as well. John Matthews adapted the fable into an attack on ""the brain-sick Demagogues"" of the French Revolution in pursuit of the illusion of freedom. In a British context, during the agitation running up to the 1832 Reform Act, a pseudonymous 'Peter Pilpay' wrote a set of Fables from ancient authors, or old saws with modern instances in which appeared a topical retelling of ""The Dog and the Shadow"". Dedicated ""to those who have something"", it turned the fable's moral into a conservative appeal to stick to the old ways. And in the following decade, a member of parliament who had given up his place in order to stand unsuccessfully for a more prestigious constituency was lampooned in the press as ""most appropriately represented as the dog in the fable who, snatching at the shadow, lost the substance"".
It is under the title ""The Dog and the Bone"" that the fable was set by Scott Watson (b. 1964) as the third in his ""Aesop's Fables for narrator and band"" (1999). More recently, the situation has been used to teach a psychological lesson by the Korean choreographer Hong Sung-yup. In his ballet ""The Dog and the Shadow"" (2013) the lost meat represents the accumulated memories which shape the personality. That same year, the fable figured as the third movement of five in the young Australian composer Alice Chance's ""Aesop's Fables Suite"" for viola da gamba.

Source
According to researcher Ulrich Marzolph, the tale ""The Ebony Horse"" was part of the story repertoire of Hanna Diyab, a Christian Maronite who provided several tales to French writer Antoine Galland. As per Galland's diary, the tale was told on May 13, 1709.

Summary
An Indian craftsman and inventor of magical devices arrives in the Persian city of Shiraz at the time of the New Year celebration, mounted upon a splendid artificial horse – surprisingly life-like, despite its mechanical nature. The king is so impressed with this automaton that he decides to present his son, the prince, with the marvellous steed.
The young prince wastes no time in climbing into the saddle and the horse ascends swiftly into the sky. When prince decides that he has flown high enough he tries to make the horse land, but finds that he cannot. Far from landing, the horse instead flies off with the prince, spiriting him away to unknown lands. Later, he rides the flying mechanical horse to the kingdom of Bengal and meets a beautiful princess, who becomes enamoured of him.
The young prince retells his adventures to the princess, and they exchange first pleasantries and later sweet nothings as they fall ever more deeply in love. Soon, the Persian youth convinces the Bengali princess to ride the mechanical marvel with him to his homeland of Persia.
Meanwhile, the Indian artifex had been unjustly imprisoned due to the disastrous test flight of his creation. In his cell, he sees the prince arriving with his beloved maiden. Reunited with his beloved son, the King of Persia releases the craftsman, who seizes the opportunity for revenge, using the horse to abduct the princess and disappearing swiftly over the horizon with her.
They soon arrive in the kingdom of Cashmere. The king of that country rescues the princess from the Indian and resolves to marry her, without her consent. As soon as the princess recovers from her shock, she pretends to have gone mad in order to forestall her forced marriage.
Determined to recover his beloved, the Persian prince wanders in search of her until he reaches Cashmere, where he learns his maiden is alive. He then hatches a plan to escape with his beloved on the mechanical horse back to Persia. By pretending to be a doctor, he is able to approach the princess and reveal himself to her. By having her pretend to be partially cured, the prince succeeds in persuading the king of Cashmere to openly present the ebony horse to complete the princess' healing. In an unattended moment, he and the princess use the horse to fly back to Persia, where they are happily married.

Legacy
Scholarship points that the tale migrated to Europe and inspired similar medieval stories about a fabulous mechanical horse. These stories include Cleomades, Chaucer's The Squire's Tale, Valentine and Orson and Meliacin ou le Cheval de Fust, by troubador Girart d'Amiens (fr).
The Horse and His Boy by C.S. Lewis carries key elements in both story and specifics like the structure of the Horse, from this story.

Analysis
Tale type
The tale is classified in Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as ATU 575, ""The Prince's Wings"". These tales show two types of narrative:

The first one: a metalsmith and a tinkerer take part in a contest to build a mechanical marvel to impress the king and his son. A mechanical horse is built and delivered to the king, to the delight of the young prince.
The second one: the prince himself commissions from a skilled craftsman to fashion a winged apparatus to allow him to fly (eg. a pair of wings or a wooden bird).

Motifs
The flying machine
Ethnologist Verrier Elwin commented that some folk tales replace the original flying machine for a trunk or a chair, and that the motif of the equine machine is common in Indian folk-tales. Similarly, according to scholar Karel Horálek, the flying machine, which appears in Indian variants, also appears in ""many Asian tales"". Hungarian professor Ákos Dömötör, in the notes to tale type ATU 575 in the Hungarian National Catalogue of Folktales (MNK), remarked that the wooden bird is an ""Oriental"" theme.

Origins
The tale The Ebony Horse, in particular, was suggested by mythologist Thomas Keightley, in his book Tales and Popular Fictions, to have originated from a genuine Persian source, since it does not contain elements from Islamic religion.
The oldest attestation and possible origin of the tale type is suggested to be an 11th century Jain recension of the Pancatantra, in the story The Weaver as Vishnu. In this tale, a poor weaver fashions an artificial likeness of legendary bird mount Garuda, the ride of god Vishnu. He uses the construct to reach the topmost room of the princess he fell in love with and poses as Lord Vishnu to impress his beloved.
Henry Parker, who collected some Sri Lankan variants of the tale type, identified three different origins for the horse: (1), a wooden flying horse created by a supernatural being; (2), a wooden flying horse made by human hands and ""magical art""; and (3) construction of one ""by mechanical art"". He also suggested that a flying horse, either of wax or wood, appears in ancient Indian literature (e.g., the Rig Veda), and may date from before the time of Christ. He also saw two possible routes of diffusion: either the tale developed in India or in Sri Lanka, and was diffused by Arabs; or the image of a winged quadruped, attested in old Assyria and Mesopotamia, ""spread to the early Aryans"".
Another line of scholarship sees a possible predecessor of the tale type with Chinese god Lu Ban, patron deity of carpenters and builders.

Variants
Distribution
Stith Thompson sees a sparsity of the tale in European compilations, although the elements of the prince's journey on the mechanical apparatus appear in Eastern tales. In addition, Jack V. Haney argued that variants appear ""in a number of Western European traditions"", while German scholar Ulrich Marzolph locates variants in Central and Eastern Europe.
Czech scholar Karel Horálek, in Enzyklopädie des Märchens, considered India the ""center of diffusion"" of the tale type. Furthermore, Horálek located two major regions of distribution: in the West, in Central Europe, Southeastern Europe and Eastern Europe; in the East, India, Persia and neighbouring countries. He also considered Turkey and Caucasus as a ""transitional area"" between both regions.

Europe
Romani people
Philologist Franz Miklosich collected a variant in Romani language which he titled Der geflügelte Held (""The Flying Hero""), about an artifex that fashions a pair of wings.
In a Romani-Bukovina tale collected by Francis Hindes Groome, The Winged Hero, a skilled but poor craftsman begins to craft a pair of wings, after he saw them in a dream. He then uses the wings to fly to the ""Ninth Region"", where he sells his work to an emperor's son. The prince uses the wings and flies to another realm, where he learns from an old woman that a princess is locked away in a tower by her own father.
Transylvanian linguist Heinrich von Wlislocki collected and published a ""Zigeunermärchen"" titled O mánusch kástuni ciriklehá (Der Mann mit der hölzernen Vogel or The Wooden Bird).

Germany
The Brothers Grimm also collected and published a German variant titled Vom Schreiner und Drechsler (""Of The Carpenter and The Turner""; or ""The Maker and the Turner""). This story was published in the first edition of their collection, in 1812, with numbering KHM 77, but omitted from the definitive edition.
A variant exists in the newly discovered collection of Bavarian folk and fairy tales of Franz Xaver von Schönwerth, titled The Flying Trunk (German: Das fliegende Kästchen).
In a variant collected from Oldenburg by jurist Ludwig Strackerjan (de), Vom Königssohn, der fliegen gelernt hatte (""About a King's Son who learned to fly""), each of the king's sons learn a trade: one becomes a metalsmith and the other a carpenter. The first one builds a fish of silver and the second fashions a pair of wooden wings. He later uses the wings to fly to another realm, where he convinces a sheltered princess he is the Archangel Gabriel.

Italy
Ignaz and Joseph Zingerle collected a variant from Merano, titled Die zwei Künstler (""The Two Craftsmen""), wherein a goldsmith and a fortune-teller compete to see who can craft a fine work: the goldsmith some gold fishes and the fortuneteller a pair of wooden wings.

Hungary
According to the Hungarian Folktale Catalogue (MNK), tale type 575, A repülő királyfi (""The Flying Prince""), registers few variants in Hungary.
Journalist Elek Benedek collected a Hungarian tale titled A Szárnyas Királyfi (""The Winged Prince""). In this story, the king traps his daughter in the tower, but a prince visits her every night with a pair of wings.

Greece
Johann Georg von Hahn collected a variant from Zagori, Greece, titled Der Mann mit der Reisekiste (""The Man with the Flying Trunk""): a rich man with an intense wanderlust commissions a flying trunk form his carpenter friend. The carpenter fills the box with ""magic vapours"" and the device takes flight. The rich man arrives at the tower of a princess from another realm and pretends to be the Son of God.

Bulgaria
The type is also attested in the Bulgarian Folktale Catalogue with the title ""Летящият дървен кон"" or Das fliegende Holzpferd (""The Flying Wooden Horse""): a goldsmith and a carpenter vie for the same woman, and arrange a mediator for their dispute (e.g., a king); in order to settle their dispute, they each fashion an apparatus (the carpenter a wooden horse, and the goldsmith a metal object); the carpenter wins, and the prince rides on the flying horse to another kingdom, where he secretly visits a princess in her tower; they escape their execution, but the wooden horse burns down, and they are separated.

Russia
The tale type is known in Russia and Slavic-speaking regions as ""Деревянный орёл (голубь)"" (The Wooden Eagle (Dove)), after the creation that appears in the story: a wooden eagle. Professor Jack Haney stated that the tale type was ""widely collected"" in Russia.
Another Russian variant of the tale type is Märchen von dem berühmten und ausgezeichneten Prinzen Malandrach Ibrahimowitsch und der schönen Prinzeß Salikalla or Prince Malandrach and the Princess Salikalla, a tale that first appeared in a German language compilation of fairy tales, published by Anton Dietrich in 1831, in Leipzig. The titular prince becomes fascinated with the idea of flying after reading about it in a book of fairy tales. He wants to commission a pair of wooden wings from a carpenter.
Professor Jack V. Haney translated a variant from raconteur Matvei M. Korguev (1883–1943), titled The Airplane (How an Airplane in a Room Carried Off the Tsar’s Son) and also classified as ATU 575. In this tale, the plane replaces the wooden eagle.

Poland
Polish philologist and folklorist Julian Krzyżanowski, establisher of the Polish Folktale Catalogue according to the international index, classified a similar story in Poland as type 575, Skrzydlaty królewicz (""Winged Prince""): the hero either commissions a pair of wings from an artisan or steals the wings from his father, and flies away to a kingdom where a princess is locked in the tower.
In a Polish tale, ""Об одном королевиче, который на крыльях летал"" (""About a prince who flew on wings""), a king commissions a pair of wings from a master craftsman. The prince finds the wings, puts them on and flies to another kingdom where he visits the princess - locked in a tower - by pretending to be an angel.

Estonia
The tale type is registered in Estonia with the title Kuningapoja imetiivad (""The Magic Wings of the King’s Son""). In Estonian variants, the prince may gain either an iron hawk from the blacksmith, or wooden wings from the carpenter. He uses the contraption to fly to another kingdom.

Lithuania
The tale type also exists in Lithuania with the name Karalaičio sparnai (""The Wings of the King""). Twelve variants were registered until 1936, when folklorist Jonas Balys (lt) published his analysis of Lithuanian folktales.

Latvia
The tale type also exists in Latvia, with the title Brīnuma spārni (""Wonderful Wings""): an artisan fashions the artificial bird for the prince, who travels to another kingdom, falls in love with a princess and escapes with her on the flying device.
In a Latvian variant, ""Волшебный конь"" (""The Magic Horse""), a blacksmith's apprentice constructs a mechanical horse. The prince convinces the king to give it to him as a gift. He flies on the artificial horse to another kingdom by a manipulating a panel of screws, where a princess is being held at a tower. At the end of the tale, before the princess's father has a chance to execute her and the prince, they escape on the mechanical horse.

Armenia
In Armenian variants of the tale type, the prince departs either on a wooden horse or on a big wheel to the princess's kingdom. After the prince loses the flying machine, his family is separated, but reunites at the end of the story, as the princess averts a possible incestual marriage with her own son by the prince.

Azerbaijan
Azerbaijani scholarship registers a similar tale in the Azerbaijani Tale Corpus, indexed as 575, Taxta at (""Wooden Horse""): a jeweller and a carpenter bet against each other whose skills are better (or for the love of a woman); the prince is called to arbiter the dispute; the jeweller fashions a golden rooster and the carpenter a wooden horse, which the prince rides on to another kingdom; in this second kingdom, the prince absconds with the local king's daughter and both flee on the horse, but are separated when the horse burns down; the princess reaches another city and places an image to find her lover; the prince and the princess reunite.

Georgia
Georgian scholarship registers 3 variants of type 575, ""Wooden Horse"", in Georgia: the vehicle is a wooden horse the prince flies on to meet a princess, and sometimes the tale shows a long period of separation for the couple.
In a Georgian tale titled ""Царевич и деревянный конь"" (""The Tsar's Son and the Wooden Horse""), a childless royal couple has a son at last, and invites the entire kingdom. A carpenter and a metalsmith decide to create presents for the newborn prince, each in their own craft. The carpenter delivers a wooden horse that can fly. The prince delights at the present. The metalsmith, however, warns his colleague that if the prince mounts the horse, he will not know how to control it. So the carpenter returns to the palace and teaches the prince, who ends up flying on the horse to regions unknown. He reaches the roof of an old woman, in another kingdom, and she invites him in. He learns of the princess lockes in the tower and flies towards her on the horse. After escaping an attempted execution, the prince and the princess flee the kingdom and separate; the horse is destroyed in a fire. The princess goes to another kingdom and becomes its sovereign when a bird lands on her head three times. Using her royal powers, she orders a bridge to be made and a picture of her husband to be affixed on it.

Ossetia
In an Ossetian tale titled ""Деревянный голубь"" (""The Wooden Dove""), a metalsmith and carpenter argue whose is the more necessary skill: metalworking or woodworking. They bring their dispute to the king to judge. The metalsmith produces a golden purse and the carpenter a wooden dove. The king awards the carpenter. The king's son overhears the decision and decides to play with the wooden dove and flies to another kingdom. He meets the son of the local aldar (ruler) and learns his sister, the aldar's daughter, lives a sad life in a high tower. The prince decides to fly to her room on the wooden dove and meets her. They fall in love and she becomes pregnant. Her servants notice something amiss with the princess, and fear the aldar may execute them. The princess and the prince escape on the wooden dove and marry. The tale continues with the adventures of the three sons of the couple, who also travel on their father's wooden dove.

Asia
Middle East
A similar story, also named The Tale of the Ebony Horse, can also be found in One Hundred and One Nights, another book of Arab literature and whose original manuscripts were recently discovered.
According to professor Ruth B. Bottigheimer, an Arabic-language manuscript mentions a tale titled Fars al-abnus ('Horse of Ebony'), predating Hanna Diyab's story by two centuries. The tale was apparently part of the second volume of Tales of the Marvellous and News of the Strange, now lost.
Andrew Lang published the story with the name The Enchanted Horse, in his translation of The Arabian Nights, and renamed the prince Firouz Schah.
Folklorist William Forsell Kirby published a tale from ""The Arabian Nights"" titled Story of the Labourer and the Flying Chair: a poor labourer spends his earnings on an old chair. He returns to the seller wanting to know the instructions on how to use the chair. The labourer manages to control the chair, which takes him to a distant terrace. He walks from the terrace into a room where a princess was sleeping. The maiden awakes with a startle with the strange person in the room, and he presents himself as Azrael, the Angel of Death.
French orientalist François Pétit de La Croix published in the 18th century a compilation of Middle Eastern tales, titled Les Mille et un jours (""The Thousand and One Days""). This compilation also contains a variant of the tale type, named Story of Malek and the Princess Schirine: the hero Malek receives a bird-shaped box from an artisan. He enters the box and flies away to a distant kingdom. In this realm, he learns of King Bahaman, who imprisoned his daughter, the Princess Schirine, in a tower.

Turkey
German scholar Ulrich Marzolph located another narrative from the Ottoman Turkish Ferec baʿd eş-şidde ('Relief After Hardship'), an anonymous book dated to the 15th century. In tale nr. 13 of the compilation, titled the Weaver and the trick He played on the Carpenter, a weaver and a carpenter compete over the love of a woman, and each creates an project: the weaver a seamless shirt and the carpenter a large chest, which he tricks the weaver to go inside. The weaver flies off on the chest and reaches the kingdom of Oman, where he introduces himself as the Angel Gabriel to a princess locked in a tower. Marzolph noted that the tale was the source for Malek and Schirin, a tale contained in the work A Thousand and One Days.

China
Chinese folklorist and scholar Ting Nai-tung (zh) established a second typological classification of Chinese folktales (the first was by Wolfram Eberhard in the 1930s). According to this new system, in tale type 575, ""The Prince's Wings"", the main character is not a prince, and the means of transportation is either a horse or an eagle.

A Persian variant is reported to have been analysed by folklorist William Alexander Clouston's Magic Elements in the Squire's Tale. In this tale, a weaver and a carpenter in Nishapur compete to impress a local woman. The weaver sews a seamless shirt and the carpenter a magic coffer. The weaver tests the coffer and flies away to another realm. He uses the coffer to reach the castle where the daughter of the king of Oman is being held and introduces himself as the Angel Gabriel. As the story continues, he defeats an army for the King of Oman, but loses the flying coffer. At the end of the story, the king discovers the ruse, but decides to keep it a secret after the angel ""Gabriel"" achieved wins for him.

Central Asia
A similar tale is attested in a manuscript archived in the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Academy of Sciences of the then Soviet Union. The manuscript, indexed as A 103, is dated to the 18th century, and tentatively sourced from Central Asia. In a summary of the tale, titled ""Рассказ о столяре, ткаче, дочери оманского падишаха и о чудесах, которые они пережили"" (""The Story of a Carpenter, a Weaver, the Daughter of the Omani Padishah and the Wonders they Experienced""), a carpenter and a weaver compete for the hand of a woman: the weaver sews a cloth without needle nor thread, and the carpenter, in retaliation, fashions a flying box he tricks his rival to enter. The weaver travels on the flying box to Oman and falls in love with the Omani princess, to whom he introduces himself as an ""arkhan"". The weaver manages to trick the padishah of Oman, and actually has success in battle with the flying box, until the day the box is burnt down. The padishah discovers the weaver's secret, but promises to keep it to himself, since the princess is expecting a child.

Uzbekistan
In an Uzbek variant, titled ""Столяр и портной"" (""The Carpenter and The Weaver""), a carpenter and a weaver are good friends. One day, they compete against each other to test their abilities to impress a girl: the weaver creates a seamless shirt. Jealous, the carpenter builds a chest and invites the weaver for a test drive. He locks his friend inside the chest, turns a screw and the chest soars to another kingdom. The weaver reaches gets off the chest, hides it and learns the local padishah has a daughter that he locks up in a tower. The weaver uses the chest to fly up to her room, while the padishah is away on a hunt, and presents himself as Azrael.
In another Uzbek tale, ""Умелые руки"" (""Skillful Hands""), a boy named Rafik is taken to be apprenticed by a carpenter. One night, he has a dream about beautiful maidens. Entranced by such vision, he slowly wither, until his father and the carpenter fashion a flying wooden horse that the boy can use to look for her. He flies on the machine and lands in another place. He learns the maidens come in the shape of doves to bathe in a nearby lake and he must hide the garments of his beloved one. He does, but she escapes with the other doves. He follows her on the wooden horse until a meadow where they rest up. Rafik wakes her up and convinces her to go with him. They return to a village and marry. She gives birth to a son. Rafik flies on the horse to another kingdom, but a fire destroys the apparatus and he is stranded there. Unaware of her husband's fate, she takes their son and goes to a caravan to another city, where they set up shop in hopes of finding Rafik. Years pass, and the family is finally reunited.

South Asia
Stith Thompson and Warren Roberts's Types of Indic Oral Tales registers the existence of tale type 575, ""The Prince's Wings"", in modern Indian and South Asian sources. In the Indic type, the hero finds the flying horse (or other wooden mechanism), flies away to another kingdom and courts the local princess; they later escape on the mechanism, but are separated when it burns down; after their separation, they reunite.
Charles Swynnerton published an Upper Indus tale from Punjab with the title Prince Ahmed and the Flying Horse: Prince Ahmed likes to play with the sons of a goldsmith, an ironsmith, an oilman, and a carpenter, much to his father's disgust. The king decided to imprison the four youths, but the prince, their friends, intercedes in their favour: all four should prove their skills. The four fashion, respectively, six brazen fishes, two large iron fishes, two artificial giants and at last a wooden horse. Prince Ahmed climbs the horse and flies to regions unknown, where he romances a princess and brings her back to his homeland.

India
Author Mark Thornhill published an Indian tale with the title The Magic Horse. In this tale, a carpenter and a goldsmith compete over who is the most skilled craftsman. The king announces he will be the judge of the dispute and orders them to bring him their finest works. The goldsmith brings a metal fish that can swim and the carpenter a wooden horse that can move about. The king's son mounts the horse and flies away to another kingdom. In this kingdom, he learns about the princess, secluded in a tower, and who is weighed very morning against a garland of flowers so that it can be assured no man has touched her.
Anthropologist Stephen Fuchs collected a tale titled Uṛhan Ghōṛā (""The Flying Horse""), from a Baiga source named Musra, from the Bijora village near Dindori in eastern Mandla. In this tale, the raja sets up a contest between a smith and a carpenter to settle their dispute. The carpenter fashions a winged horse with an internal engine. The raja's young son rides on the horse and is carried over to another kingdom, where he sleeps with the princess. The princess's belly begins to grow and her father discovers the culprit: the foreign prince. On the day of the execution, he escapes with the princess on the winged horse, but the couple must make a hasty descent on a small island for her to give birth. Once their son is born, the family is separated: the young boy is adopted by a royal couple; the princess loss her memory and is adopted as the niece of a lower cast woman, and the prince marries another rani. Their fates converge as the prince stops an incestual marriage between son and the mother.
In another Indian variant, The Flying Horse, a carpenter creates an ""airplane with an engine"" for his friend, the prince. The prince rides the airplane to a marble palace in a distant kingdom across the ocean, where he meets a princess. They fall in love and she becomes pregnant. After an unfortunate accident, the prince separates from the pregnant princess, who gives birth to a boy. The two are also separated: the boy is found by a couple and his mother is rescued by prostitutes. Years later, the boy becomes a youth, buys his mother from the brothel and meets his father, who has become an old man.
In an Magahi tale translated to English as A Carpenter and a Goldsmith, a carpenter and a goldsmith are good friends and travel around to earn money. However, when it is moment to share the money, they argue over it, and seek the king to arbiter their dispute. The king decides to settle their dispute by having them show their skills: the goldsmith fashions a gold fish and the carpenter creates a horse out of wood, but no one wants to ride it. The king offers money for anyone to ride the wooden horse, and still nothing. The king's son, the prince, mounts the horse and the carpenter presses a button, causing the horse to fly away. The prince flies to another kingdom and falls in love the local princess, who marries him. The princess becomes pregnant and joins the prince in his flight back to his land, but feels unwell during the journey and asks to descend. The princess gives birth to a boy and the prince flies on a horse to fetch a midwife, leaving his wife and son there. However, the prince loses sight of the horse, which was pulled apart by a shepherd, and has to live as a householder. Back to the princess, a merchant finds mother and son and takes them in, then the princess leaves on a pilgrimage, and reaches the place where the wooden horse broke down. She announces she will marry the one who can relate the tale of the wooden horse, but no one can. Her husband, the prince, hears news of this, and goes there. He tells the whole story and reunites with his wife. Both return to the merchant and fetch their son, then the family returns to the princess's kingdom. The couple's parents are relieved to see them alive and well, and the prince's father rewards the carpenter and the goldsmith for their skills.

Sri Lanka
Author Henry Parker published a Sri Lankan  tale titled The Wax Horse: a king hides his son from the outside world due to a prophecy that the son would go away from his kingdom. One day, the young prince sees a wax horse with wings in the market and the king buys it for him. The prince climbs on the horse and flies to another kingdom, eventually meeting a princess.
In another Sri Lankan tale collected by Henry Parker, Concerning a Royal Prince and a Princess, a carpenter's son fashions a Wooden Peacock, which the Prince test drives and arrives in another kingdom. He hides the Wooden Peacock in the foliages and sees a princess bathing. Later, the prince flies to her window. The princess, then, decides to hide her lover inside her room by commissioning a man-sized lamp with a secret compartment. The princess becomes pregnant and escapes with the prince to the jungle. Her royal lover gets stranded in the sea, due to the machinations of fate, and the princess is forced to raise the child on her own. She, however, gets help from an ascetic, who, by performing ""an Act of Truth"", creates two other children out of flowers for the maiden to rear.

Uyghur people
In a Uyghur tale, The Wooden Horse, a carpenter and a metalsmith quarrel about who is the most skilled. The king decides to set a contest to settle their dispute: the metalsmith creates an iron fish and the carpenter a wooden horse that can fly. The king's son, the prince, is delighted at the wooden horse and asks his father to try it. The prince controls the device and begins to ascend to the skies, disappearing in the distance. He arrives at another kingdom whose king has built a ""palace in the sky"" to hide his daughter in. The prince visits the princess with the horse for three times, which infuriates the king. The king orders a nationwide search for the boy. The princess escapes with the prince on the flying wooden horse, but as soon as they land, the princess wants to go back to get a treasure from her mother. She leaves the prince there and flies back to her kingdom, being captured by her own father, who arranged her marriage to another man. The prince begins to notice her absence and wander about in search of food. He finds an orchard with fruits and eats them, and horns and a white beard appear on his face. He eats other fruits and reverses the transformation. He decides to collect some of them and goes back on the road. He finds a prince's retinue and gives some of the fruits to the prince - who is to marry the princess of the sky palace - to cause a physical transformation. Despairing at the situation, the retinue concoct a plan to replace the prince for the fruit seller (which was the youth's plan all along). The youth-as-the-foreign-prince meets the princess again and, after the wedding celebrations, they escape on the wooden horse.

Africa
Morocco
René Basset collected a variant in the Berber language.

Literary variants
Illustrator Howard Pyle included a tale named The Stool of Fortune in his work Twilight Land, a crossover of famous fairy tale characters (Mother Goose, Cinderella, Fortunatus, Sinbad the Sailor, Aladdin, Boots, the Valiant Little Tailor) that meet in an inn to tell stories. In The Stool of Fortune, a nameless wandering soldier is hired by a magician to shoot some animals. Angry at the unjust payment, the soldier enters the magician hut and sits on a three-legged stool, waiting for his employer. Wishing he was anywhere else, the stool obeys his command and starts to fly away. The soldier then arrives at the tower room of a unsuspecting princess and announces himself as ""The King of Winds"".
Sufi scholar Idries Shah adapted the tale as the children's book The Magic Horse: a King summons a woodcarver and a metalsmith to create wondrous contraptions. The woodcarver constructs a wooden horse, which draws the attention of the king's youngest son, prince Tambal.

Adaptations
The Russian variant of the tale type ATU 575, ""The Wooden Eagle"", was adapted into a Soviet animated film in 1953 (ru).
The tale type was also adapted into a Czech fantasy film in 1987, titled O princezně Jasněnce a ševci, který létal (Princess Jasnenka and the Flying Shoemaker). The film was based on a homonymous literary fairy tale by Czech author Jan Drda, first published in 1959, in České pohádky.

Epic
The epic of Katamaraju, a chieftain in Kanigiri, who fought a battle with the Nellore Chola king Nalama Siddi, on the banks of the Paleru River in the 13th century. Katamaraju, due to severe drought, had migrated with his people to the fertile lands of Nellore. There he entered a covenant with the king of Nellore for grazing his cattle and sheep. Due to a misunderstanding, the covenant was broken and resulted in a tremendous battle in which many of the great heroes on both sides lost their lives.
About the year 1260, a dangerous feud broke out between Manumasiddhi II and Katamaraju, the chief of Erragaddapadu in Kanigiri region. The feud was on the issue of the rights of the two princes to use certain wide meadows as grazing grounds for their flocks of cattle. It led to the fierce engagement of the two sides and the bloody battle was fought at Panchalingala on the Paleru river. Manumasiddhi's forces led by Khadga Tikkana, the cousin of poet Tikkana won the battle, but the leader perished. This feud and the consequent battle formed the theme of the popular ballad entitled ""Katamaraju Katha"". Shortly after this disastrous battle, Manumasiddhi died.
With the death of Manumasiddhi II, the Nellore Chola kingdom lost its individuality, became a battle ground between the Kakatiyas and the Pandyas and changed hands frequently. In the reign of Kakatiya Prataparudra II, the Nellore region became part and parcel of the Kakatiya empire and lost its political significance.

Synopsis
A childless Kurukh couple found a gourd by their rice field and started to eat it, but it begged them to cut it open gently. Inside the gourd was a crab, whom the couple decided to adopt. The woman tied a basket to her belly, pretended to be pregnant, and then claimed to have given birth to the crab. 
In time, the couple married the crab off, but his wife did not like being married to a crab. She sneaked off while her in-laws were asleep, but the crab sneaked ahead of her. He asked a banyan tree whose it was; it said it was his, and he ordered it to fall down. He then traded his crab shape for a human shape from within the tree. The girl unknowingly met him at a dance and gifted him her ornaments. He arrived before her in his crab shape again and returned her ornaments, but she was frightened.
She attempted to sneak out again but stayed behind to watch the crab. After he had put on his human shape, she asked the banyan tree whose it was; it said it was hers; she ordered it to fall down and burn the crab shape. When her husband could not find her at the dance, he came back, and she jumped out, caught him, and took him home.

Analysis
Tale type
Folklorists Stith Thompson and Warren Roberts established an index for South Asian folktales based on the international Aarne-Thompson Index. In their joint work, titled Types of Indic Oral Tales, they classified the tale as type 441, ""Hans My Hedgehog"", a miscellaneous type that, while still belonging to the cycle of the Animal as Bridegroom and dealing with the marriage between a human maiden and an enchanted animal, lacks the quest for the vanished or missing husband.

Motifs
Elwin noted that the crab is considered monogamous and an example of domestic fidelity.: 232 
The tale contains the motif B647.1.1., ""Marriage to person in crab form"".

Variants
Professor Stuart Blackburn locates variants with the crab husband among tribal groups from India (namely, the Gondi, the Kuruk, and Santal), as well as from Burma (Shan), and
northern Laos (Mien).
Elwin collected a tale from the Muria people from Markabera with the title The Crab-Prince. In this tale, a Muria couple live alone and plant rice near the bank of a river, when a crab called Kakramal Kuar comes out of the river to eat their rice. The woman asks her husband to prepare a Jitka trap for the crab. The Muria man catches the crab and is poised to kill it with an axe, when the crab asks the man to take it home, to which he agrees. Eight days later, the local Rajá is summoning all the young people, men and women, to work in harvesting the fields. The crab decides to join them despite the Muria woman's objections. However, the crab is expelled by other workers and finds another spot in the Raja's daughter's fields, where he takes off the shell and becomes a ""beautiful twelve-year-old boy"". Meanwhile, Raja's daughter brings some gruel to feed the harvesters and learns about the crab working on her fields. She goes there and sees the boy, who quickly hides back into his crustacean shell. The princess places his food between his claws and joins the others. Later that same day, the crab joins the remaining workers for a meal with pork and liquor. Sometime later, the princess sulks and asks her father for her to be married as soon as possible. The Rajah summons princes from all locations for a suitor selection, but the princess chooses none. When the crab comes to the assemblage, the princess places a garland on him and marries him. One night, the crab boy takes off the shell and goes to the stables to mount on his father-in-law's horses and ride them to exhaustion. The horses' condition begins to arouse suspicions in the monarch, who decides to investigate: he spies on his son-in-law coming out of his shell and riding the horses. The Raja then tells his daughter to burn the crab shell the next time he takes it off. The princess does it and the boy remains human for good, although at first, he does not want to be seen without his shell.
Author Shovona Devi published a Bengali tale titled The Crab Prince. In this tale, a poor widow earns her living by begging for alms. One day, she reaches an empty hut in the forest where a vermilion-coloured crab lives. The crab treats the widow as his mother and promises to bring her food. The next day, the crab goes to the food shops and crams the food in his ear to bring to the widow. Next time, he brings her money for her to build a better house for her. The third time, the widow cries that if the crab was human, he could bring her a daughter-in-law. The crab promises to marry none other than the prince's daughter and decides to go to the castle. On the journey, he is joined by a cat, a tiger, bamboo, and a river, which each enters the crab's ear. The crab goes to the prince's palace and demands to be married to his daughter. The prince thinks it is an affront and tries to kill the crab many times, but each time, his friends (the cat, the tiger, the bamboo, and the river) stop the prince's attack. The prince surrenders and allows his daughter to marry the crab. Sometime later, the prince visits his daughter in the widow's new house and learns that his son-in-law becomes human by night and remains a crab by day. The prince then advises his daughter to get rid of the crab shell. The next time the now-human crab is asleep, the princess pounds his shell to dust and he stays human permanently.

It is perhaps the most common theme in Bhutanese folk art, featuring on many temple murals, stupas, and as a decorative pattern on many daily utensils.: 108 : 53  It is the best-known national folktale of Bhutan and is popular in Tibet and Mongolia:: 107  it is widely referred to in these cultures.

Outline of story
A popular scene often found as wall paintings in Tibetan religious buildings represents an elephant standing under a fruit tree carrying a monkey, a hare and a bird (usually a partridge, but sometimes a grouse, and in Bhutan a hornbill) on top of each other. The scene refers to a legend which tells that four animals were trying to find out who was the oldest. The elephant said that the tree was already fully grown when he was young, the monkey that the tree was small when he was young, the hare that he saw the tree as a sapling when he was young and the bird claimed that he had excreted the seed from which the tree grew. So the bird was recognized by the other animals as the oldest, and the four animals lived together in co-dependence and cooperation, helping each other to enjoy the fruits of the tree. After the story is finished, it is revealed the partridge was the Buddha in a previous life.: 51  The story was meant as an illustration of cooperation and respect for seniority, and was told by the Buddha after some of his students had failed to pay due respect to the senior disciple Śāriputra. Sometimes the tale also describes the animals upholding the five precepts and teaching them to others. One of the oldest extant forms of the story is the Pāli version, called the Tittira Jataka.: 51

Themes
Communal harmony and respect for seniority are the main moral of the story. Such respect stands in contrast with a pecking-order according to strength, size and power: it is the partridge which is most respected, not the elephant. Although the Buddha did sometimes downplay the value respecting older people merely for their age, in this story he illustrates that a senior person should nonetheless be respected for their experience, because, as Tachibana points out, ""the maturity of age is generally the sign of much experience"". However, the story led to the establishment of several rules of conduct with regard to respect for seniority in the context of the monastic life, in which the number of years ordained as a monk (Sanskrit: bhikṣu; Pali: bhikkhu) is measured, rather than age. Buddhist monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu explains the relation between respect for seniority and harmony, drawing from the story: ""A hierarchy based on seniority, however, is both objective and, in the long run, less oppressive: one's place in the hierarchy is not a measure of one's worth.  Such a hierarchy also discourages the pride and competition that would come if bhikkhus could fight their way up the hierarchy by outdoing the measurable merit of others.""
The four animals represent the different habitats of the animal world—the sky, the trees, the ground, and underground.: 51  The partridge assumes the role of the most senior animal: in pre-modern India, the partridge was highly regarded for its intelligence and understanding  of language. The excreting of the seed of the tree is relevant, because some Indian trees are believed to only sprout when the seed is excreted by a bird, thus further amplifying the concept of cooperation and mutual dependence.: 53  The image of the animals standing on each other's shoulders, on the back of a patient elephant, also portrays social and environmental harmony: the bird finds a seed and plants it, then the rabbit waters it, and the monkey fertilizes it. Once the seed sprouts and begins to grow, the elephant protects it. After some time, the small plant grows into a big, beautiful tree full of healthy fruit. By working together and using their individual talents, the four friends are able to reach and enjoy the fruit.

Origins
The primary source for the Buddhist legend of the four harmonious brothers is the Vinayavastu (Wylie: 'dul ba'i gzhi), which forms the first section of the Kangyur, the canon of Tibetan Buddhism.: 107  In canons of other Buddhist traditions, such as in the Pāli Canon of Theravāda Buddhism, and in the texts of the Mahāsāṃghika, Mūla-Sarvāstivāda and Sarvāstivāda orders, almost the same Jātaka tale is found in the Vinaya and Jātaka collections. The Dharmaguptaka and Mahīśāsaka orders did not consider the story part of the Jātaka, however, and only included it in their Vinayas. Bhikkhu Analayo believes that  the story originally was not considered a previous life of the Buddha, but a didactic parable taught by the Buddha.

Similar motifs worldwide
Old Irish scholar Eleanor Hull has pointed out that the story may reveal a custom of the ancient world to determine the date based on the life spans of different animals. Stories dealing with the question which animal lives the longest are found throughout the world. Most versions of the story usually feature three animals, as indeed, the Pali and Chinese versions of the Jātaka do. As for the fourth animal not present in the Pāli version, the hare—it was included in later versions.: 51 
A similar story was made famous when the Brothers Grimm included it in their collection of folk tales, as the ""Town Musicians of Bremen"".: 107 : 53

When hunters arrive with their dogs, the cat climbs a tree, but the fox thinks of many ways without acting and is caught by the hounds.

Included in collections of Aesop's fables since the start of printing in Europe, it is number 605 in the Perry Index. In the basic story a cat and a fox discuss how many tricks and dodges they have. The fox boasts that he has many; the cat confesses to having only one. When hunters arrive with their dogs, the cat climbs a tree, but the fox thinks of many ways without acting and is caught by the hounds.  Many morals have been drawn from the fable's presentations through history and, as Isaiah Berlin's use of it in his essay ""The Hedgehog and the Fox"" shows, it continues to be interpreted anew.

History
The fable contrasts the fate of one animal proud of the many stratagems at its disposal with another possessing one simple trick. In time of danger it is that one trick that proves more effective than the many options. A story of world-wide popularity and many variations, it is listed as type 105 in the Aarne-Thompson-Uther folklore index.
There is a proverb in a fragment attributed to the ancient Greek poet Archilochus: πόλλ' οἶδ' ἀλώπηξ, ἀλλ' ἐχῖνος ἓν μέγα (the fox knows many little things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing). In Erasmus' Adagia from 1500, the expression is recorded as Multa novit vulpes, verum echinus unum magnum. This proverb seems to imply the existence of an ancient fable involving a hedgehog instead of a cat, as do some folktales from the Balkans.

Eastern
The analogous story of ""Hundred-wit, Thousand-wit and Single-wit"" appears in the fifth division of the Panchatantra which considers the consequences of ill-considered action.  The tale concerns two fish and a frog who debate how to avoid being taken by fishermen in the pond they inhabit. Single-wit the frog advises flight and is the only one to escape being caught.

 The story was also preserved in the Persian Kalila and Dimna as a tale of three fish, one wise, one clever and one stupid.  When the fish notice fishermen passing, the wise fish simply makes a quick exit from the pool,  the clever fish manages to avoid being eaten by playing dead, while the stupid fish is caught and eaten. Rumi, writing in the 13th century, used this story in Book IV of his Masnavi, drawing from it the advisability of resigning one's identity into the wholeness of the Creator.
The analogue in the ancient Indian Mahabharata has the swan and the crow as protagonists.  The swan has only one way to fly while the crow boasts of a hundred and one. The crow, however, gets himself into trouble with his displays of aerobatics when he ends up far out over the ocean, unable to find a place to land. The swan flies down to the crow asking ""Which of the hundred and one ways of flying is this?"" before carrying him, suitably humbled, back to safety.

European
Written records of this fable type do not appear in Europe after Archilochus until Medieval times. Here the boastful animal is generally the fox, but the animal with the one trick may be the hedgehog (Greece), the crane (Russia), the squirrel (Armenia), or the cock or dove. In western Europe, it is always the cat, appearing in very similar versions, though with variation in the number of tricks the fox possesses. Some of the collections with this variation include the Anglo-Latin Romulus (80 tricks), Marie de France's Ysopet (2 tricks, ""and a whole sackful besides""), as well as the fable collections of Odo of Cheriton (17 tricks in a bag) and John Sheppey. In the German folk version collected by the Grimm Brothers, it is of a hundred tricks that the fox brags, ""and a whole sackful of cunning"".
The fox is known for his craftiness in Western fables, and sometimes the fabulists go into more naturalistic detail in their retellings. In the contemporary poem  ""The Owl and the Nightingale"", for instance, the nightingale, arguing that its one ability (to sing in summertime) is worth more than all the skills of the owl, describes some of the fox's devices, the feints and devious courses it takes to outwit the dogs: ""The fox can creep along the hedge and turn off from his earlier route, and shortly afterwards double back on it, then the hound is thrown off the scent"" (þe uox kan crope bi þe heie an turne ut from his forme weie an eft sone kume þarto þonne is þe hundes smel fordo).
For the preacher Odo, the cat represented those who know the single scheme, to ""spring into heaven"", while the fox stands for ""attorneys, casuists, tricksters"" and others with a ""bagful of tricks"". The interpretation in the 13th century Gesta Romanorum is very similar, making a distinction between ""the simple men and women who know but one craft, that is to call to God"", and those that make a living by the glibness of their tongues. The moral supplied by Marie de France is different, though perhaps complementary: that a wise man would be able to detect a liar, however plausibly he talked. Berechiah ha-Nakdan followed her by including the tale as number 94 of his hundred Fox Fables in Hebrew. His moral is different in emphasis again, contrasting simple, necessary labour with status-consciousness. For him the fox represented those who despise and neglect basic work to look after themselves and sustain their families, those who say ""our hand is too lofty to put sickle to standing grain"" and boast of their professions: ""I am a scribe; I am a smith, I am a tailor; I am a goldsmith, I am a merchant; I am a sage, and what other is there like me to equal me?""
In William Caxton's 1484 collection of Aesop's fables, this one is told about people who have pretensions of wisdom and subtlety, but who in fact are ""grete fooles and knowynge no thynge"". Another landmark in the fable's history was its inclusion in Jean de La Fontaine's influential Fables Choisies (IX.14, published in 1678). With La Fontaine, the fable has moved from the pulpit to the salon and his telling of this tale is typically lighter and more urbane in tone; the truth the tale points up for him is a question of expediency rather than the grave moral failure seen by earlier authors. Here the cat and the fox are travelling together and, as ""the way was long and therefore wearisome, so they shortened it by arguing.  Argumentation is a great help.  Without it one would go to sleep. Our pilgrims shouted themselves hoarse. Then having argued themselves out, they talked of other things.""  The fable proceeds as in earlier versions and La Fontaine finishes with the practical moral: ""Too many expedients may spoil the business.  One loses time in choosing between them and in trying too many. Have only one; but let it be a good one.""
The American composer Vincent Persichetti included this version as the fourth piece in his Fables for narrator and orchestra (1943).

The Hedgehog and the Fox
The main difference from the version of the fable with a hedgehog is that the contrast in the ancient version is between flight and defence rather than between strategies of flight, as in the cat and fox version. In early Renaissance times, the writer Laurentius Abstemius questioned whether the cat's instinctive solution is ultimately better than the fox's ingenuity by rewriting the fable as De lepore sese vulpi praeferente ob pedum velocitatem (a hare preferring itself to the fox on account of its fleetness). While the hare vaunts itself on its superior speed, the fox points out that its own slyness has been a better means of survival. The author sums up by saying that intelligence is the better quality.
The question has remained open and the different behaviours have been reinterpreted in other ways since. In his essay ""The Hedgehog and the Fox"", originally written in 1953, the philosopher Isaiah Berlin uses the fable as summed up by Archilochus to divide writers and thinkers into two categories: hedgehogs, who view the world through the lens of a single defining idea; and foxes, who draw on a wide variety of experiences and for whom the world cannot be boiled down to a single idea. The essay, though not meant too seriously by Berlin, has proved influential, with a number of writers using his distinction.
Stephen Jay Gould's anthology The Hedgehog, the Fox, and the Magister's Pox uses both Berlin's book and the fable in exploring the complex relationship between the sciences and the humanities. Gould sees Archilochus's original image as containing two levels of metaphorical meaning for human contrasts. ""The first speaks of psychological styles...  Scramble or persist.""  The second is a question of intellectual practice: ""Diversify and color, or intensify and cover"", a union of the two strategies being the most fruitful for understanding between the two disciplines.
The abstract sculptor Richard Serra also cites Isaiah Berlin's essay as the source of the title of his The Hedgehog and the Fox (1999), in the grounds of Princeton University. Serra explained at the time of the sculpture's installation, ""It points to how scholars either become free thinkers and invent or become subjugated to the dictates of history. This is the classical problem posed to every student."" His reading therefore reverses the moral order of the original fable. The hedgehog, being resistant to change, is intellectually dead; the fox's adaptability (demonstrated by sculpture's relationship to its environment) is the correct strategy for intellectual development and survival.

There are early Latin and Greek versions and the fable may even have been portrayed on an ancient Greek vase. The story is used as a warning against listening to flattery.

The story
In the fable a crow has found a piece of cheese and retired to a branch to eat it. A fox, wanting it for himself, flatters the crow, calling it beautiful and wondering whether its voice is as sweet to match. When it lets out a caw, the cheese falls and is devoured by the fox.
The earliest surviving versions of the fable, in both Greek and Latin, date from the 1st century of the Common Era. Evidence that it was well known before then comes in the poems of the Latin poet Horace, who alludes to it twice. Addressing a maladroit sponger called Scaeva in his Epistles, the poet counsels guarded speech for ""if the crow could have fed in silence, he would have had better fare, and much less of quarreling and of envy"".
The second reference to the fable appears in Horace's satire on legacy hunting (II.5):

A season'd Scrivener, bred in Office low,
Full often mocks, and dupes the gaping crow.
The poem has generally been taken as a caution against listening to flatterers. Phaedrus prefaces his Latin poem with the warning that the one 'who takes delight in treacherous flattery usually pays the penalty by repentance and disgrace'. One of the few who gives it a different interpretation is Odo of Cheriton, whose lesson is that virtue is forgotten in the pursuit of ambition. Babrius has the fox end with a joke at the crow's credulity in his Greek version of the story: 'You were not dumb, it seems, you have indeed a voice; you have everything, Sir Crow, except brains.' In La Fontaine's Fables (I.2), the fox delivers the moral by way of recompense for the tidbit. In Norman Shapiro's translation:

Flatterers thrive on fools' credulity.
The lesson's worth a cheese, don't you agree?""
The crow, shamefaced and flustered swore,
Too late, however: ""Nevermore!""
As was the case with several others of La Fontaine's fables, there was dissatisfaction in Christian circles, where it was felt that morality was offended by allowing the fox to go unpunished for its theft. Therefore, a sequel was provided in the form of a popular song of which a version is recorded in Saskatchewan. In this, the fox's funeral is dolefully described but ends with the crow cawing from its branch,

I'm not at all sorry, now that he's dead,
He took my cheese and ate it in my stead,
He's punished by fate  – God, you've avenged me.

The German writer Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, who had decided views on how fables should be written, gave Aesop's Der Rabe und der Fuchs an ironic twist. In his rewritten version, a gardener has left poisoned meat out to kill invading rats. It is this that the raven picks up but is flattered out of it by the fox, which then dies in agony. To emphasise the moral he is drawing, Lessing concludes with the curse, 'Abominable flatterers, may you all be so rewarded with one poison for another!'.
An Eastern story of flattery rewarded exists in the Buddhist scriptures as the Jambhu-Khadaka-Jataka. In this, a jackal praises the crow's voice as it is feeding in a rose-apple tree. The crow replies that it requires nobility to discover the same in others and shakes down some fruit for the jackal to share.
What seems to be a depiction of the tale on a painted vase discovered in excavations at Lothal from the Indus Valley civilisation suggests that the story may have been known there at least a thousand years earlier than any other source. In this scene, the bird is depicted perched on a tree holding a fish, while a fox-looking animal is underneath.

Musical versions
Since the fable stands at the beginning of La Fontaine's fables, generations of French children commonly learned it by heart. This will explain the many settings by French composers. They include:

Louis-Nicolas Clérambault
Jacques Offenbach in Six Fables de La Fontaine (1842) for soprano and small orchestra (performance available on YouTube)
Charles Gounod in a setting for a cappella voices (1857)
Benjamin Godard, the third of Six Fables de La Fontaine for voice and piano, op. 17 (1872/9)
Louis Lacombe in a setting dated 1888
Charles Lecocq in Six Fables de Jean de la Fontaine for voice and piano (1900), available on YouTube
André Caplet in Trois Fables de Jean de la Fontaine (1919) for voice and piano, in a forcefully dramatised version
Maurice Delage in Deux fables de Jean de la Fontaine (1931)
Marie-Madeleine Duruflé as the sixth in her 6 Fables de La Fontaine for a cappella female voices (1960)
Joseph Noyon in a song setting
Jean-René Quignard for 2 children's voices
Claude Ballif as the second in his Chansonettes : 5 Fables de La Fontaine for small mixed choir  (Op.72, Nº1 1995)
Dominique Preschez as the first of his Trois fables en une for small orchestra and soprano (1995)
Jacques Frochot made a setting for a cappella choir (1996)
Vladimir Cosma, as the fifth piece in Eh bien ! Dansez maintenant (2006), a light-hearted interpretation for narrator and orchestra in the style of an accordion waltz

There was also a setting of the French words by the Dutch composer Rudolf Koumans in Vijf fabels van La Fontaine (op. 25, 1968) for school chorus and orchestra. In 1995 Xavier Benguerel i Godó set a Catalan translation of the fable for recitation with orchestra in his 7 Fábulas de la Fontaine.
Isabelle Aboulker included the fable among the seven in her children's 'fabl'opera' La Fontaine et le Corbeau (1977) for mezzo-soprano, baritone, children's voices and small chamber orchestra. Jean-Marie Morel (b. 1934) also exploits its dramatic possibilities in what he describes as his small cantata, La Fontaine en chantant (1999), for children's choir and string quartet. David Edgar Walther prefers the term 'short operatic drama' for his Aesop's Fables (2009), a 12-minute cycle with libretto by the composer in which ""The Fox and The Raven"" appears as the first of three pieces. The fable was also choreographed by Dominique Hervieu in 2003 for Annie Sellem's composite ballet project, Les Fables à la Fontaine. In it two dancers perform to a sound fusion score accompanied by video affects.
Other composers went directly to Aesop for their inspiration. In English these include the eleventh item in A Selection of Aesop's Fables Versified and Set to Music with Symphonies and Accompaniments for the Piano Forte (London 1847) and the fifth in Mabel Wood Hill's
Aesop's Fables Interpreted Through Music (New York 1920). An English version by Peter Westmore was set for children's voices and piano by Edward Hughes as the second of his ten Songs from Aesop's Fables (1965) and Greg Smith included it in his ""Aesop's Fables"" for four-part chorus of mixed voices and piano accompaniment (New York/London 1979). In Germany, under the title Der Fuchs und der Rabe, Werner Egk set the fable for children's performance in 1932 and the Swiss composer Bertrand Gay wrote a setting for 2 trumpets, narrator and piano. It was Martin Luther's verse translation that Hans Poser included as the third piece in his Die Fabeln des Äsop for accompanied men's choir (0p.28, 1956). Ancient Greek is used in Lefteris Kordis' setting for octet and voice (2010) among his Songs for Aesop's Fables, which has now been recorded under the title ""Oh Raven, If You Only Had Brains!""

Other artistic applications
The fable is depicted no less than three times in the border of the Bayeux Tapestry and it has been speculated that a political commentary is intended. The picture is that of an ungainly bird sitting in a tree under which an animal is lying. They are looking at each other with their mouths open, and there is some object in the air between them. The reason for pointing to this particular fable is quite clear. Harold's vanity has led him to overreach himself and so lose everything. A later tapestry on which the story is portrayed came from the Gobelins Manufactory and was designed by Jean-Baptiste Oudry.
The fable also figured in church architecture, most notably on a column in the Romanesque church of San Martín de Tours in Spain. In later centuries the fable was used on household china, on tiles, on vases, and figured in the series of La Fontaine medals cast in France by Jean Vernon. A less conventional use was the hydraulic statue built for the Versailles Labyrinth that was constructed for Louis XIV, one of thirty nine sets of statues in the maze illustrating Aesop's fables.  The fox and the crow eventually figured, among many other beasts, on the grandiose monument to La Fontaine designed by Achille Dumilâtre in 1891. This stood at the angle of the Jardins de Ranelagh between the Avenue Ingres and Avenue du Ranelagh in Paris XVI and was melted down during World War II. It was replaced by Charles Correia's present monument in 1983. This portrays the fabulist standing and looking down at the cheese-bearing crow at his feet, while the fox gazes up at it from the steps to the pedestal. In Russia, too, there was an adaptation of La Fontaine's fable by Ivan Krylov, ""The Crow and the Fox"" (in this case little different from the French original), which figures among several others on panels around Andrey Drevin's monument beside the Patriarch Ponds in Moscow.

In Germany the fable was popular, not simply because of Lessing's adaptation but from Martin Luther's versified translation. Several zoos there have sculptures based on the story, of which Stefan Horota has been responsible for two. In Rostock Zoo the fox looks up at a tree in which the bird is supposed to be perched. It is based on his 1965 bronze sculpture now beside a woodland path in the zoo at Gera. There a stylised crow stands with its head twisted sideways holding the cheese, while the fox sits looking upward with its snout just below the bird's beak. Then on the wall at the entrance of the small zoo at Weißwasser there is a ceramic plaque of the fable created by the local Culture-house some time before 1990. Another bronze group was made by Karlheinz Goedtke for the grounds of an apartment block in Lübeck (1974). There is also a sandstone stele in the grounds of the Lessing Museum in Kamenz. This takes the form of a rounded trunk with a leafy canopy, beneath which the crow perches on a shorn branch with the fox looking up at it below.
In the United States the fable figured at one time as one of six bronze gate panels commissioned for the William Church Osborne Memorial Playground in Manhattan's Central Park in 1952. The work of sculptor Paul Manship, it is now in the Smithsonian American Art Museum. The seated fox looks up at the crow in an attractive piece that makes the most of the decorative possibilities of the reeds and oak-leaves that play a prominent part in the overall design. The challenge with this subject is always to avoid the limitations imposed by a fable that has more dialogue than action. André Deluol also manages to vary the formula in the stone sculpture he created outside the La Fontaine infant school in the Croix-de-Vernailles quarter of Etampes in 1972. There the fox look back over its shoulder at the crow in a design held together by the large leaves of a stylised tree. An article is dedicated to the statue and versions of the fable.
Possibilities are more restricted in the two dimensional plane of a picture: whether printed or painted, these have presented an almost uniform monotony of design over whole centuries. One of the rare variations is the painted panel by Léon Rousseau (fl.1849-81) which pictures the fox crouching with one paw on the fallen cheese and bending his head directly upwards to taunt the agitated crow. There is also the 1961 print by the German artist Horst Janssen of a large striped fox looking up at a minute bird on a twig. Here it is the differences in size and the admiring prominence given the wily flatterer that constitutes its originality.

Philately
The fable has been a favourite with stamp designers. Among the countries that have featured it are the following:

Albania issued a 1995 set with several fables on each stamp; the fox and the crow is featured on the 3 leke stamp.
France commemorated the third centenary of La Fontaine's death in 1995 with a set of six stamps featuring individual fables, of which this was one.
Greece issued a 1987 set dedicated to Aesop's fables; the fox and the crow figures on the 32 drachma stamp.
Hungary issued sets dedicated to the fables in both 1960 and 1987; in the former the fox and the crow was on the 80 fillér(0.8 forint) stamp and on the 2 forint stamp in the latter.
The Maldives issued a set in 1990 in which Walt Disney characters act out the fables; the fox and the crow appears on the 1 rufiyaa stamp.
Monaco celebrated the 350th anniversary of the birth of Jean de la Fontaine in 1972 with a 50 centimes composite stamp on which the fox and the crow was one of the fables illustrated. The 3,86 value of 2021 celebrates the author's 400th anniversary with an illustration of this fable alone behind his portrait head.
Niger celebrated the author's 350th anniversary with a set of air mail stamps which also incorporated the fable's moral; the fox and the crow figures on the 25 franc stamp and the design adapts elements of Léon Rousseau's panel.
Poland issued a set dedicated to folk tales in 1980, designed by Helena Winogradow-Matuszewska and featuring this fable on the 40 groszy stamp.

There is also an Indian analogue. Interpretations of the story's meaning have differed widely in the course of two and a half millennia.

Ancient versions
A lion grown too old and weak to hunt pretended to be sick as a ruse and ate the animals that came to visit him in his cave. But the fox only greeted him from outside and, on being asked why it did not enter, replied ""Because I can only see tracks going in, but none coming out"".
The earliest application of the fable is in an economic context in First Alcibiades, a dialogue often ascribed to Plato and dated to the 4th century BCE. There Socrates tries to dissuade a young man from following a political career and, in describing the Spartan economy,  says:

and as to gold and silver, there is more of them in Lacedaemon than in all the rest of Hellas, for during many generations gold has been always flowing in to them from the whole Hellenic world, and often from the barbarian also, and never going out, as in the fable of Aesop the fox said to the lion, 'The prints of the feet of those going in are distinct enough'- but who ever saw the trace of money going out of Lacedaemon?
The fable is also one among several to which the Latin poet Horace alluded in his work, seeing in it the moral lesson that once tainted with vice there is no returning. Condemning the get-rich-quick culture of the Roman bankers in his first Epistle, he comments:

If the people of Rome chanced to ask me why
I delight in the same colonnades as them, yet not
the same opinions, nor follow or flee what they love
or hate, I'd reply as the wary fox once responded to
the sick lion: Because those tracks I can see scare me,
they all lead towards your den and none lead away.
There is a similar Indian incident in the Buddhist Nalapana Jataka, in which a monkey king saved his troop from destruction by a water-ogre by reconnoitering a jungle pool from which they wished to drink and reporting that ""all the footprints led down into the water, but none came back.""

Reasons for caution
The moral drawn in Mediaeval Latin retellings of the fable such as those of Adémar de Chabannes and Romulus Anglicus was that one should learn from the misfortunes of others, but it was also given a political slant by the additional comment that ""it is easier to enter the house of a great lord than to get out of it"", as  William Caxton expressed it in his English version. Hieronymus Osius, however, confined himself to making the story's lesson that the wise man notes not only signs of danger but also learns from them to be cautious. The necessity of being wary in all one's enterprises, ""keeping in view the profit and loss"", was also the message of Gilles Corrozet's emblematic use of the fable in his Hecatomographie (1540).

During the 17th century the fable was almost always interpreted as a warning against association with rulers. Wenceslas Hollar emphasised the political connection in his illustration of The Fables of Aesop (1673). At the mouth of a cave, a crown and sceptre are laid prominently on rocks as the lion feasts on its slaughtered visitors. The same point is made by Pieter de la Court in his Sinryke Fabulen (Amsterdam, 1685). Above the woodcut illustrating the fable is the Dutch distich Een oud hoveling, een oud schoveling (an old courtier, an old survivor), while below it is the Latin proverb Cum principibus ut cum igne (With princes as with fire, be wary). 
In Jean de La Fontaine's Fables additional details are drawn from royal practice. The lion issues a safe conduct (passeport) to the deluded animals bidden to visit him. In reply the foxes send back a note that echoes the former Latin conclusion: ""While seeing how the beasts get in,/ We do not see how they get out"". The inference to be drawn is that the word of the powerful is not to be trusted. Roger L'Estrange's 1692 narration follows La Fontaine in making communication between fox and lion an exchange of diplomatic notes but ends on the more pointed moral that ""the kindness of ill-natur'd and designing People should be throughly consider'd and examin'd, before we give credit to them"".
Later interpretations counsel resorting to reason in order to avoid harm, in this life or thereafter. Samuel Croxall ends the 'application' in his Fables of Aesop and Others (1722) on the thought that ""it becomes us, as we are reasonable Creatures, to behave ourselves as such and to do as few Things as possible of which we may have Occasion to repent"". Thomas Bewick, in his retelling of 1818, goes much further and proclaims a chauvinistic religious message. ""There is no opinion, however impious or absurd, that has not its advocates in some quarter of the world. Whoever, therefore, takes up his creed upon trust, and grounds his principles on no better reason than his being a native or inhabitant of the regions wherein they prevail, becomes a disciple of Mahomet in Turkey, and of Confucius in China; a Jew, or a Pagan, as the accident of birth decides.""

As well as having an Asian analogue, there have been variant versions over the centuries.

Stampeding before doom
The oldest form of a fable involving a stampede started by a hare appears in the form of a cumulative tale known in the Buddhist scriptures as the Duddubha Jataka (332). On hearing the sound of a falling fruit, a hare sets all the other animals fleeing in the belief that the earth was collapsing. There the story is associated with the Indian idiom 'the sound the hare heard', meaning an impossibility. A much later Western equivalent is the folk tale of Henny Penny, where the associated idiom is 'the sky is falling'.
In the Aesopic fable of ""The Hares and the Frogs"" the stampede is more limited. There are several versions in both Greek and Latin. In some the hares are set in motion by the sound of wind in the leaves; in others they call a meeting in which they come to the conclusion that their lives are so perpetually under threat that they may as well fling themselves into the river. As they are dashing towards it, however, they disturb the frogs on the bank who all leap into the water. Seeing this, a more thoughtful hare calls off the decision to kill themselves; if there are some creatures who can be frightened by hares, then their own lot cannot be as bad as they imagined.
In the story retold about 1190 in Marie de France's Ysopet, the hares have decided to move to another land but halt when they see frogs leaping into a pond to escape them and come to the conclusion that ""never will they find a kingdom, or come to a place on this earth, where everyone may live without fear, work or sorrow"". The Jewish version of Marie's near contemporary, Berechiah ha-Nakdan, makes the band of emigrants terrified even of the croaking of frogs at night before deciding to return home.
Two Neo-Latin poems are dedicated to the fable by Hieronymus Osius in his collection of 1564. In the first of these, he draws a parallel with human suffering and remarks that no-one really wishes to die; in the shorter poem that follows, the conclusion is that learning to overcome our fears is part of growing up. Eduard de Dene's Dutch version of the tale makes an emblematic appearance under the title ""A stout heart is the remedy for fear"", where it is given a religious interpretation. The illustrator of that book was Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder, who eventually fled to England. His woodcut of the subject was to be reproduced there as a trencher, about the edge of which the gist of its moral is epitomised as needing to fear destruction of the soul rather than of the body. A century later, in 1668, the Classical story was told with stylish panache of a single hare in La Fontaine's Fables (II.14).
During mediaeval times, some commentaries on the fable underlined the necessity of remaining philosophically contented. This theme was also taken up when the fable was included in Robert Dodsley's collection and subsequently reprinted in Thomas Bewick's illustrated edition of The Fables of Aesop in 1818. There it ends with the verse reflection,

The miseries of half mankind unknown,
Fools vainly think no sorrows like their own;
But view the world and you will learn to bear
Misfortunes well, since all men have their share.
The same conclusion, that one should commiserate with the sufferings of others, was also the conclusion of the Neo-Latin retelling by Pantaleon Candidus at the start of the 17th century.

In the arts
Under the Latin title of Lepores et ranae a Czech translation by Pavel Jurkovic was set by Ilja Hurník as the final piece in his Ezop for mixed choir and orchestra (1964); and under the title ""The Rabbits and the Frogs"" the story was set by Howard J. Buss as the fifth item in his ""Fables from Aesop"" (2002).

He appears in the proverb Kahaan Raja Bhoj, Kahaan Gangu Teli (""Where is the king Bhoja, and where is the oilman Gangu""), which is used to compare an important or high-status person (such as Bhoja) to an ordinary or low-status person (such as Gangu).","Gangu Teli or Ganga Teli is an apocryphal oil-presser (Teli) from India.

Proverb
Many Indian languages feature the proverb comparing Bhoja and Gangu Teli (or an equivalent character). Besides ""Gangu"" and ""Ganga"", several variants of the name of the Teli (""oilman"") appear in different languages and dialects. For example, Bhojva (Bhojpuri), Bhunjva (Bagheli) Doontha (Bundeli), Kāngla (Braj), Kangda (Haryanvi), Ganglo (Rajasthani), Gangva (Kumaoni), Gangaram (Bengali), and Ganga (Marathi).
Variations of the phrase include (transliterations in IAST):

Hindi-Urdu: Kahān Rājā Bhoj, kahān Gaṃgū Telī
Awadhi: Kahān Rājā Bhoj au kahān Bhojvā Telī
Bhojpuri: Kahān Rājā Bhoj, kahān Bhojvā Telī
Bundeli: Kahān Rājā Bhoj, kahān Ḍoonṭha Telī
Braj: Kahān Rājā Bhoj, kahān Kanglā Telī
Rajasthani: Kathe Rājā Bhoj, Kathe Gāṃglo Telī
Kumaoni: Kān Rājā Bhoj, Kān Gaṃgva Telī
Bengali: Kothāy Rāja Bhoj, Kothāy Gaṃgārām Telī
Marathi: Kuthe Bhoj Rājā, Kuthe Gaṃgā Telī
Haryanvi: Kitt Rājā Bhoj, Kitt Kāngḍā Telī
Garhwali: Kakh Rājā Bhoj, Kahh Bandar Chor
Kauravi: Kahān Rājā Bhoj, Kahān Gaṃgū Telli
Bagheli: Kahān Rājā Bhoj, Kahān Bhunjvā Telī
Punjabi: Kithe Rājā Bhoj, Kithe Gaṃgū Telī
In Kashmiri, the proverb changed into ""Yetih Raja Bhoj, Tatih Ganga Teli"", equivalent of the Hindi ""Jahān Rājā Bhoj, Vahān Gaṃgā Telī"" (""Ganga Teli is wherever Raja Bhoj is"").
In Telugu language, the equivalent phrase is Nakka ekkada, nagalokam ekkada? (""Where is the jackal and where is heaven?"").

Legends
According to scholar P.K. Gode, in Marathi language, the source of the proverb seems to be the Sanskrit-language text Kalpa-druma-kalika, a commentary on the Jain text Kalpa-sutra. The commentary is of uncertain date, but Gode dates its extant manuscript to earlier than 1650 CE, based on appearance. The Kalpa-druma-kalika narrates the story of Bhoja and Ganga-Teli as follows:

A scholar (bhattacharya), who had spent 30 years learning all the sciences at Pratishthana-pura (Paithan), was very proud of his knowledge. After winning debates in several regions including Gujarat and Marwar, he went to king Bhoja of Ujjayini, and defeated all the 50 scholars in Bhoja's royal assembly, including Kalidasa and Bhavabhuti. Bhoja felt disappointed to see his scholars lose their prestige to a man from outside his kingdom. One day, Bhoja met a one-eyed oilman called Ganga-Teli (IAST: Gāṃgā-Telī), who said he would easily defeat the scholar from Pratishthana. Bhoja then introduced Ganga-Teli as his leading scholar (Bhoja-raja-bhattacharya) to the scholar from Pratishthana (Dakshina-bhattacharya or ""southern scholar""), and arranged a debate between the two.
The debate began with the southern scholar showing one finger to Ganga-Teli. An angry Ganga-Teli responded by showing him two fingers. The southern scholar responded by showing him a hand with five fingers unfolded. Ganga-Teli responded by showing him a fist. The southern scholar then accepted his defeat, and bowed to Ganga-Teli.
Bhoja asked the southern scholar to explain what had just happened. The scholar replied that by showing one figure, he had indicated that the god Shiva is the only creator of the universe. Ganga-Teli replied with two fingers to indicate that Shiva is associated with Shakti. The scholar then showed five fingers to indicate that there are only five sense organs. Ganga-Teli responded by showing a closed fist to indicate it is possible to restrain these sense organs. The scholar then described Ganga-Teli as a scholar of unparalleled greatness who possessed ""great powers of renunciation"". Feeling excessively humiliated, he then left for his native place.
Bhoja then asked Ganga-Teli to explain the nature of the debate. Ganga-Teli said that the southern scholar showed one finger to indicate that his opponent was one-eyed. Ganga-Teli responded by showing two fingers to indicate that he would make the scholar blind in both eyes. The scholar then showed his palm to indicate that he would slap Ganga-Teli.
At this point, Bhoja and the members of his royal assembly started laughing. Bhoja honoured Ganga-Teli, who then returned home.
According to Gode, the antiquity of the proverb in Hindi and other north Indian languages is uncertain, and possibly other Jain texts contained a similar story.
Maive Stokes, in Indian Fairy Tales (1880), records a story titled Raja Harichand's Punishment. In this story, a divine punishment forces king Harichand and his queen to go into exile as destitutes. While wandering, they go to their friend Ganga Teli, who had provided them with a comfortable stay during their earlier visit. However, this time, because of their poor appearance, Ganga Teli provides them with unpleasant rooms and bad food. Next, they go to their other friend, king Bhoj, who treats them well.
Ganga Datt Upreti, in Proverbs and Folklore of Kumaun and Garhwal (1894), records another story about the origin of the proverb: Ganga and Bhoja were rival kings. Bhoja subjugated Ganga, seized his kingdom, had his limbs cut off. An oilman (teli) found Ganga, had him healed, and employed him. After the oilman's death, Ganga inherited his house and business. Even after becoming a handicapped oilman, Ganga continued to oppose Bhoja, inviting ridicule from people who declared that Gangu teli is not worthy of being compared to king Bhoja.
Historian Kashinath Krishna Lele, in The Paramāras of Dhār and Mālwā (1908), suggested that the proverb referred to the Paramara king Bhoja's military success against ""Gangeya of Telangana"", the Telangana region being subordinate to the Kalachuri king Gangeya (Ganga or Gangu). Historian R. Nath similarly connects the proverb to Bhoja's success against ""Gangeya of Telingana"".
Maharashtra-Vaksampradaya (1942), a dictionary of Marathi proverbs, states that Gangu (or Ganga) in the proverb refers to the Kalyani Chalukya king Tailapa II (""Gangaraja Tailapa"") and Bhoj refers to the Paramara king Munja, the uncle of Bhoja. P.K. Gode finds this explanation unsatisfactory, noting that while Tailapa II had killed Munja in the late 10th century, it is not clear if ""Gangaraja"" was an epithet of Tailapa or how Munja can be identified with his nephew Bhoja. Y. R. Date and C. G. Karve, the editors of the dictionary, do not cite any source for the explanation. Some other historians, such as K. M. Munshi and K. N. Seth, similarly speculate that the proverb may have originated as an allusion to the military successes of Bhoja against Gangeya and the Kalyani Chalukyas who controlled the Telangana region, ""Teli"" being a corrupt form of ""Telangana"".
Ambedkarite author S. Anand states that according to ""official history"", when king Bhoj faced a problem during the construction of the Panhala Fort, a priest (pandit) suggested a double human sacrifice - of a mother and her newborn child - as the solution. Gangu Teli is said to have 'volunteered' to sacrifice his wife Jakkubai and their newborn. Anand states that the fort has a small tomb for Jakkubai. He identifies king Bhoj as the ""eleventh-century ruler of the Malwa region"" (the Paramara king), but the Panhala fort was actually built by the Shilahara king Bhoja II.

Casteist connotations
Several modern interpreters consider the phrase as casteist, since the Teli community historically held a low status in the traditional caste hierarchy. Sumit Rajak, a research scholar at the Jadavpur University, cites the phrase as an example of Bollywood ""bashing the low-caste communities"". In Sagina (1974), the song Sala Main to Saab Ban Gaya features a line Kaisa Raja Bhoj bana hain mera Gangu Teli (""How my Gangu Teli has become Raja Bhoj""). Dulhe Raja (1998) features a song containing the lines Chachundar ke sar pe na bhaye chameli / Kahaan Raja Bhoj aur kahan Gangu Teli (""A string of jasmine ain't no good on a rodent / Bhoj shall always be king, Gangu Teli redundant""). According to Rajak, the proverb ""aptly indicates
how in Indian society it is seemingly imperative, or rather normative, to compare a person of lower quality with a low-caste group."" The Vidarbha Teli Samaj Mahasangh, an organization of the Teli caste, protested against the Dulhe Raja song, stating that it hurt the sentiments of the Teli community.
In 2013, Indian National Congress's Ghulam Nabi Azad referred to the Bharatiya Janata Party's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi (who belongs to the Teli caste) as Gangu Teli. The Bharatiya Janata Party criticized Azad's remarks as casteist and derogatory.
Referring to the Panhala fort legend, the Punjabi Dalit-Naxalite Sant Ram Udasi and his daughter Iqbal Singh have portrayed Gangu Teli as an unwilling victim, coerced and brutalized by the monstrous king Bhoj.

Many other stories contain geese that lay golden eggs, though certain versions change them for hens or other birds that lay golden eggs. The tale has given rise to the idiom 'killing the goose that lays the golden eggs', which refers to the short-sighted destruction of a valuable resource, or to an unprofitable action motivated by greed.

Story and moral
Avianus and Caxton tell different stories of a goose that lays a golden egg, where other versions have a hen, as in Townsend: ""A cottager and his wife had a Hen that laid a golden egg every day. They supposed that the Hen must contain a great lump of gold in its inside, and in order to get the gold they killed [her]. Having done so, they found to their surprise that the Hen differed in no respect from their other hens. The foolish pair, thus hoping to become rich all at once, deprived themselves of the gain of which they were assured day by day.""
In early tellings, there is sometimes a commentary warning against greed rather than a pithy moral. This is so in Jean de La Fontaine's fable  of La Poule aux oeufs d'or (Fables V.13), which begins with the sentiment that 'Greed loses all by striving all to gain' and comments at the end that the story can be applied to those who become poor by trying to outreach themselves. It is only later that the morals most often quoted today began to appear. These are 'Greed oft o'er reaches itself' (Joseph Jacobs, 1894) and 'Much wants more and loses all' (Samuel Croxall, 1722). It is notable also that these are stories told of a goose rather than a hen.
The English idiom ""Kill not the goose that lays the golden egg"", sometimes shortened to ""killing the golden goose"", derives from this fable. It is generally used of a short-sighted action that destroys the profitability of an asset. Caxton's version of the story has the goose's owner demand that it lay two eggs a day; when it replied that it could not, the owner killed it. The same lesson is taught by Ignacy Krasicki's different fable of ""The Farmer"":

There is another variant on the story, recorded by Syntipas (Perry Index 58) and appearing in Roger L'Estrange's 1692 telling as ""A Woman and a Fat Hen"" (Fable 87): A good Woman had a Hen that laid her every day an Egg. Now she fansy'd to her self, that upon a larger Allowance of Corn, this Hen might be brought in time to lay twice a day. She try'd the Experiment; but the Hen grew fat upon't, and gave quite over laying. His comment on this is that 'we should set Bounds to our Desires, and content our selves when we are well, for fear of losing what we had.' Another of Aesop's fables with the moral of wanting more and losing everything is The Dog and the Bone.

Eastern instances
An Eastern analogue is found in the Suvannahamsa Jataka, which appears in the fourth section of the Buddhist book of monastic discipline (Vinaya). In this the father of a poor family is reborn as a swan with golden feathers and invites them to pluck and sell a single feather from his wings to support themselves, returning occasionally to allow them another. The greedy mother of the family eventually plucks all the feathers at once, but they then turn to ordinary feathers; when the swan recovers its feathers they too are no longer gold. The moral drawn there is:

North of India, in the formerly Persian territory of Sogdiana, it was the Greek version of the story that was known. Among the 8th-century murals in Panjakent, in the western Sugdh province of Tajikistan, there is a panel from room 1, sector 21, representing a series of scenes moving from right to left where it is possible to recognize the same person first in the act of checking a golden egg and later killing the animal in order to get more eggs, only to understand the stupidity of his idea at the very end of the sequence. A local version of the story still persists in the area but ends differently with the main character eventually becoming a king.
In the Mahabharata a story is recounted of wild birds that spit gold, and were discovered by a man who soon strangled them ""out of greed"".

Use in the arts
The French text was set as the fourth of Rudolf Koumans' Vijf fabels van La Fontaine for children's choir and orchestra (Op. 25 1968). Yassen Vodenitcharov (1964-) has created a chamber opera from the story (2004) and Vladimir Cosma included the poem as the ninth piece in Eh bien ! Dansez maintenant (2006), a light-hearted interpretation for narrator and orchestra in the style of a foxtrot.
The majority of illustrations of ""The Goose that Laid the Golden Eggs"" picture the farmer despairing after discovering that he has killed the goose to no purpose. It was also one of several fables applied to political issues by the American illustrator Thomas Nast. Captioned Always killing the goose that lays the golden eggs, it appeared in Harpers Weekly for March 16, 1878. There the picture of the baffled farmer, advised by a 'Communistic Statesman', referred to the rail strike of 1877. The farmer stands for the politically driven union members whose wife and children sorrow in the background.
Two postage stamps have also featured the fable. Burundi's 1987 set of children's tales uses Gustave Doré's picture of the despairing farmer holding the body of the slaughtered goose (see above). The fable later appears on the 73 pence value from a Jersey set celebrating the bicentenary of Hans Christian Andersen in 2005, although ""The Goose that Laid the Golden Egg"" never figured among his stories.

Films
The theme of a duck, goose or hen laying a golden egg, but not the traditional plot line, was taken up in films in both the United States and Russia. In Golden Yeggs (Warner Bros, 1950) it was given cartoon treatment, while it provided a comedy MacGuffin in The Million Dollar Duck (Walt Disney Productions, 1971). The 1971 film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory features geese laying golden eggs filled with chocolate.

Seven of the eight paradises are pavilions constructed for Bahram's ""therapy"" of storytelling. There is also a link to the architectural and garden plan of eight paradises.

The narrative
The narrative commences with the story of Bahram and Dilaram.
Later, Bahram has seven differently-coloured domed pavilions built for him within his palace grounds, in which wait seven princesses from various parts of the world. Bahram Gur visits each on a different day of the week and each of them tells him a story:

Saturday – the Black Pavilion – the Indian Princess (The Tale of the Three Princes of Serendip)
Sunday – the Yellow Pavilion – the Princess of Nimruz
Monday – the Green Pavilion – the Slav Princess
Tuesday – the Red Pavilion – the Tatar Princess
Wednesday – the Violet Pavilion – the Princess of Rum
Thursday – the Brown Pavilion – the Arabian Princess
Friday – the White Pavilion – the Princess of Khwarezm

Manuscripts
The Hasht Bihisht, and indeed the whole of the Khamsah, was a popular work in the centuries after Khusraw's death, not only in India, but in Iran and the Ottoman Empire, and as such was illustrated nearly as frequently as Nizami's Khamsah from the early fifteenth century on.

Translations
The Hasht Bihisht has never been translated entirely into any language except Russian and Italian. Verse translations of two stories (Tuesday and Friday) by Sunil Sharma have been published.
Lal and Prasada provide a partial direct-to-English translation and commentary of Saturday's tale which introduces The Three Princes of Serendip.

Walters Art Museum manuscript W.623
An illustrated and illuminated manuscript of the poem was part of a Khamsah from 1609 CE produced in Safavid Iran. All texts are written in black nastaʿlīq script with chapter headings in red.

Walters Art Museum manuscript W.624
The poem was illustrated in a manuscript probably produced in Lahore in the late sixteenth CE which is associated with the patronage of Akbar (r. 1556 – 1605 CE).
The manuscript was written in nasta'liq script by one of the greatest calligraphers of the Mughal atelier, Muhammad Husayn al-Kashmiri, honoured with the epithet Zarrin Qalam (golden pen).

Andrew Lang included it in The Lilac Fairy Book.  It is Aarne-Thompson 91.

Synopsis
A monkey and a shark struck up a friendship, with the monkey tossing his friend the fruits of a giant mku yu tree that grew overhanging the ocean.   After a time, the shark said if the monkey would only come home with him, he would give him a gift, and offered to carry him.  The monkey accepted, but half way there, the shark told him that the sultan of his country was deathly ill and needed a monkey's heart to cure him.  The monkey said it was a pity, because if he had known, he could have brought his heart, but as it was, he had left it behind.  The shark, deceived, brought him back to get it.  The monkey instantly jumped up into the tree and was not to be lured back down.  He told the shark a story of a washerman's donkey, which was twice persuaded to meet with a lion, and so lost its life the second time — and that the monkey was not a washerman's donkey.

Versions
India
An earlier version of this tale, with a crocodile instead of a shark, serves as the frame tale for the fourth book of the Panchatantra. In this version it is the crocodile's wife who, after enjoying the figs given by the monkey to her husband, desires to eat the monkey's heart. Whereas the Swahili version has only one embedded tale, in the Panchatantra version the monkey and crocodile tell each other numerous tales in the course of their story, the second of which corresponds to the story of the washerman's donkey.

Japan
Folklorist Seki Keigo stated that the tale is ""very popular"" in Japan, and reported an ancient Japanese version from the 11th century, in the Konjaku Monogatarishū.

Commentary
J. R. R. Tolkien in his On Fairy-Stories cites this tale as an example of not a true fairy tale, because while the detached heart is a common fairy-tale motif, it appears in it only as a ploy.

Set in Takht Hazara and Tilla Jogian, it follows the story of love, forced separation, and eventual simultaneous demise of two youths in the Punjabi countryside.
It is one of the four popular tragic romances of the Punjab. The other three are Mirza Sahiban, Sohni Mahiwal and Sassi Punnun.

History
Heer Ranjha has been written by several poets. Damodar Gulati, who was first to narrate the tale, claimed to be its eyewitness. His Qissa is deemed to be the oldest Heer in Punjabi literature. He stated himself to be from Jhang—the home of Heer. 16th century poet Shah Hussain also used the tale in his Kafi. Waris Shah later re-narrated the story in his novel in 1766, in which he stated that the story has a deeper meaning, referring to the unrelenting quest that man has towards God.

Plot
Heer (Izzat Bibi) is an extremely beautiful woman, born into a wealthy family belonging to the Sial clan, while Dheedo Ranjha, who is from the Ranjha clan, is the youngest of four brothers and lives in the village of Takht Hazara by the Chenab river in rural Punjab. Being his father's favourite son, unlike his brothers who have to toil in the lands, he leads a life of ease, playing the flute ('Wanjhli'/'Bansuri'). After the death of Ranjha's father, Mauju Chaudhry, Ranjha has a quarrel with his brothers over land, and leaves his home. In Waris Shah's version of the epic, Ranjha leaves home because his brothers' wives refused to serve him food.
Eventually he arrives in Heer's village and falls in love with her. Heer's father offers Ranjha a job of herding his cattle. Ranjha, routinely, plays his flute in the fields after work and Heer becomes mesmerized by it and eventually falls in love with him. They meet each other secretly for several years until they are caught by Heer's envious uncle, Kaido, and her parents Chuchak and Malki. Heer is forced by her family and the local priest (Maulvi) to marry another man named Saida Khera, belonging to the Khera clan.
Ranjha is left heartbroken. He wanders the countryside alone, until he eventually meets a Jogi (ascetic). After meeting Gorakhnath, the legendary founder of the Kanphata (pierced ear) sect of Jogis at Tilla Jogian (""Hill of Ascetics""), Ranjha becomes a jogi himself, piercing his ears and renouncing the material world. While reciting the name of the Lord, he wanders all over Punjab, eventually finding the village where Heer now lives.
The two return to Heer's village, where Heer's parents agree to their marriage – though some versions of the tale state that the parents' agreement is only a deception. On the wedding day, Kaido, Heer's uncle, poisons her food in order to punish the girl for her behaviour. Hearing this news, Ranjha rushes to aid Heer, but is too late, as she has already eaten the poison-laced food and has died. Brokenhearted once again, Ranjha eats the remaining poisoned food and dies by her side.
Heer and Ranjha are buried in Heer's hometown, Jhang. Love-smitten couples and others often pay visit to their mausoleum.

Legacy and influence
Heer Ranjha is part of the Qissa genre of tragic love stories, along with tales such as Laila Majnu and Sassui Punnhun.
Because its plot involves a romance opposed by family members and ends with the two lovers dying, the story is often compared to the Shakespeare play Romeo and Juliet.

In popular culture
The epic poem has been made into several feature films since 1928:

In 2013, the television serial Heer Ranjha, directed by Shahid Zahoor and produced by Yousuf Salahuddin, aired on PTV Home. Heer Ranjha is a 2020 Indian Punjabi-language period drama television series starring Amaninder Pal Singh and Sara Gurpal in the lead roles. It aired on Zee Punjabi and is based on the folktale of Heer and Ranjha.

In music
Bally Jagpal British musician has a song named ""Ranjha"" dedicated to their story. The British musician Panjabi MC references the tale of Heer and Ranjha in his 2003 song Jogi. It has been sung by various Pakistani singers, including the classical/traditional artist Ghulam Ali.
The tale is mentioned in popular Bollywood songs such as ""Ranjha"" by Rupesh Kumar Ram from the movie Queen ,""Ranjha Ranjha"" by Rekha Bhardwaj and Javed Ali from the movie Raavan and ""Dariya"" from the movie Baar Baar Dekho.
The names of Heer and Ranjha have been referred in the song lyrics of ""One Love:  The Taj Anthem"" by A.R. Rahman.

Story
God Thangching (Thangjing) created two persons and made them the extreme lovers. Henjunaha Yangleingamba is the hero and Lairoulembi (alias Thongnang Lairuklembi) is the heroine. Henjunaha's father died at an early age and so, Henjunaha was brought up by his widowed mother Khoiju Hongbi. On the other hand, Lairoulembi grew up under the parentage of her father Thongnang Ningthouba. As the two grew up, they became devoted lovers.
One day, lady Khoiju Hongbi had an ominous dream. In her dream, she saw the incidents of her pasts during the untimely death of her husband. In her dream, she fetched water using a pitcher from a stream, during which her headgear cloth fell into the water stream getting drifted away by the current before she could picked it up. In the same dream, she followed the trails and found some people getting it and giving it back to her. 
With that unusual dream, lady Khoiju Hongbi was anxious. So, she warned her son Henjunaha not to go out of the house.
One day before Khoiju Hongbi's warning to Henjunaha, a person died and the dead body was buried at a place called ""Khundinbi"" which was near the settlement of Henjunaha. When it was nighttime, lady Khoiju Hongbi had a dinner with her son and went to bed earlier than usual. Though his mother was fast asleep, Henjunaha could not sleep because he had a desire to meet his lover Lairoulembi. Taking advantage of the situation as his mother had slept, he sneaked out of the house and went to the house of Lairoulembi. He hold a polo-stick in his hand during his journey to meet his lover.
When he reached almost half of his way, he heard the sound of muffled drone near the ""Khundinbi"". At first, he thought that some villagers were talking there and the night was not late yet. However, in reality, it was actually a coven of evil spirits meeting to banquet on the corpse's fleshes. Hensunaha was panicked to find out the truth. However, he did not lose his senses yet. He thought that if he ran away, the spirits would surely discover him and capture him. So, he decided to join them with his head covered, disguising himself as a member of the coven. It was not long that the spirits smelt the strong smells of a living human flesh. So, they head-count their members and found out one number additional. However, Hensunaha tricked them by taking upon himself the task of recounting and declaring the number to be correct, thus making them confused. When they were again about to continue the feast on the flesh before the arrival of dawn, Henjunaha slipped out and ran as fast as he could towards his lover's house. Realising the real living human now, the spirits chased him. They caught hold of him just on the point Hensunaha was about to set one of his foot on the verandah of his lover's house. Lairoulembi was fast asleep and could not hear the panic stricken calls of her lover Hensunaha. When she woke up and came out in the dead of night, she was horrified to find her lover in a pool of blood. On the very place, she committed suicide by thrusting a sharp knife into her own body.
The parents of Hensunaha and Lairoulembi were traumatized to see the conditions of their beloved children. Later, the dead bodies of the two lovers were buried together.
Hensunaha's soul was taken away into the underworld. However, Lairoulembi's soul was denied the entry into the land of the death because she committed suicide, which means she made her own destiny, instead of obeying gods' destiny laid on her.
Lairoulembi's soul was prevented from crossing the Styx (Meitei: Ashi Turel) in the netherworld. The river of the land of the death could be crossed through a tiny thread and a bar serving as the bridge. Getting disappointed, she kept weeping on the dry sands of the river bank of the other side. Meanwhile, the youngest wife of God Thongalen (Thongaren) came out to fetch water from river and saw Lairoulembi's soul. The goddess felt pity of her and so, she pleaded her beloved husband God Thongalen to provide a place for the poor Lairoulembi's soul. At first, Thongalen denied the request but later changed his mind and allowed both the souls of Hensunaha and Lairoulembi to return to the human world to enjoy the pleasures of life for one hundred years.
Meanwhile, on the human world, the smart dog of Lairoulembi's parents sensed some sounds from beneath the burial ground of the two lovers. The dog immediately brought its masters to the place. The ground was dug out and to everyone's surprise, Hensunaha and Lairoulembi got up again alive. Then, the two devoted lovers lived happily ever after.

In popular culture
In 2015, four books based on folktales from Manipur, including one of Henjunaha, were published in Imphal.
In 2017, at Lamboikhongnangkhong, Imphal, a show Henjunaha was shown, which drew great public responses.
The book Henjunaha Lairoulembi, was published in Hindi Sahitya Parishad, Imphal.

Similar stories go back more than 25 centuries and ""Henny Penny"" continues to be referred to in a variety of media.

The story and its name
The story is listed as Aarne–Thompson–Uther Index type 20C, which includes international examples of folktales that make light of paranoia and mass hysteria.
There are several Western versions of the story, of which the best-known concerns a chick which believes that the sky is falling when an acorn falls on its head. The chick decides to tell the king and, on its journey, meets other animals which join it in the quest. After this point, there are many endings. In the most familiar, a fox invites them to its lair and then eats them all.
In most retellings, the animals have rhyming names, commonly Chicken Licken or Chicken Little, Henny Penny or Hen-Len, Cocky Locky, Ducky Lucky or Ducky Daddles, Drakey Lakey, Goosey Loosey or Goosey Poosey, Gander Lander, Turkey Lurkey, and Foxy Loxy or Foxy Woxy.
In the United States, the most common name for the story is ""Chicken Little"", as attested by illustrated books for children dating from the early 19th century. In Britain, it is best known as ""Henny Penny"" and ""Chicken Licken"".

History
The story was part of the oral folk tradition and only began to appear in print after the Brothers Grimm had set a European example with their collection of German tales in the early years of the 19th century. One of the earliest to collect tales from Scandinavian sources was Just Mathias Thiele, who in 1823 published an early version of the Henny Penny story in the Danish language.  The names of the characters in this version are Kylling Kluk, Høne Pøne, Hane Pane, And Svand, Gaase Paase, and Ræv Skræv. In Thiele's untitled account, a nut falls on Kylling Kluk's back and knocks him over. He then goes to each of the other characters, proclaiming that ""I think all the world is falling"" and setting them all running. The fox Ræv Skræv joins in the flight and, when they reach the wood, counts them over from behind and eats them one by one. Eventually the tale was translated into English by Benjamin Thorpe after several other versions had appeared.
Once the story began to appear in the English language, the titles by which they went varied considerably and have continued to do so. John Greene Chandler (1815–1879), an illustrator and wood engraver from Petersham, Massachusetts, published an illustrated children's book titled The Remarkable Story of Chicken Little in 1840.  In this American version of the story, the characters' names are Chicken Little, Hen-Pen, Duck-Luck, Goose-Loose, and Fox-Lox; Chicken Little is frightened by a leaf falling on her tail.

A Scots version of the tale is found in 
Robert Chambers's Popular Rhymes, Fireside Stories, and Amusements of Scotland of 1842.  It appeared among the ""Fireside Nursery Stories"" and was titled ""The hen and her fellow travellers"". The characters included Henny Penny, Cocky Locky, Ducky Daddles, Goosie Poosie, and an unnamed tod (fox). Henny Penny became convinced that ""the lifts were faun"" (the heavens were falling) when a pea fell on her head.
In 1849, a ""very different"" English version was published under the title ""The Story of Chicken-Licken"" by James Orchard Halliwell. In this Chicken-licken was startled when ""an acorn fell on her bald pate"" and encounters the characters Hen-len, Cock-lock, Duck-luck, Drake-lake, Goose-loose, Gander-lander, Turkey-lurkey and Fox-lox.
It was followed in 1850 by ""The wonderful story of Henny Penny"" in Joseph Cundall's compilation, The Treasury of pleasure books for young children. Each story there is presented as if it were a separate book; this version also had two illustrations by Harrison Weir. In reality the story is a repetition of the Chambers narration in standard English, except that the dialect phrase ""so she gaed, and she gaed, and she gaed"" is retained and the cause of panic is mistranslated as ""the clouds are falling"".
Benjamin Thorpe's translation of Thiele's Danish story was published in 1853 and given the title ""The Little Chicken Kluk and his companions"". Thorpe describes the tale there as ""a pendant to the Scottish story…printed in Chambers"" (see above) and gives the characters approximately the same names as in Chambers.
Comparing the different versions, we find that in the Scots and English stories the animals want ""to tell the king"" that the skies are falling; while in the American story, as in the Danish, they are not given any specific motivation. In all versions they are eaten by the fox, although in different circumstances.

Definition
The name ""Chicken Little"" and the fable's central phrase The sky is falling! have been applied in contexts where people are accused of being unreasonably afraid, or to those trying to incite an unreasonable fear in those around them. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary shows 1895 as the first use of the name ""Chicken Little"" to refer to ""one who warns of or predicts calamity, especially without justification"". However, a much earlier oration delivered to the city of Boston on July 4, 1844 contains the passage:

To hear their harangues on the eve of the election, one would suppose that the fable of Chicken Little was about to become a truth, and that the sky was actually falling.
Behavioural scientists have recognised that such typical fearmongering can sometimes elicit a response called Chicken Little syndrome, described as ""inferring catastrophic conclusions possibly resulting in paralysis"". It has also been defined as ""a sense of despair or passivity which blocks the audience from actions"". The term began appearing in the 1950s and the phenomenon has been noted in many different societal contexts.

Idiomatic usage
Collins Dictionary describes the term ""Chicken Little"" as used idiomatically in the US of ""a person who constantly warns that a calamity is imminent; a vociferous pessimist"". The Oxford English Dictionary also notes that usage of the cognate ""Chicken Licken"" for ""A person who panics easily, or spreads alarm amongst others"" is ""originally and chiefly US"" usage. In support it quotes Christian Connection's Herald of Gospel Liberty for 2 November 1922 as referring to another character in the tale too: ""Those who encourage nostrums and quacks are Goosey Pooseys and Chicken Lickens."" 
Nevertheless, still other characters have appeared in the lyrics of songs in the UK. Round about 1900, Florence Hoare included ""Henny Penny"" as part of her suite of ""Seven Children's Songs"" written to fit music originally arranged by Johannes Brahms in 1858. And in their song ""Moving in with"" (from Bummed, 1986), the English band Happy Mondays included the refrain: ""Henny Penny, Cocky Locky, Goosey Loosey/ Turkey Lurky, Tricky Licky, Ducky Lucky/ I'd say we're all on the move when the sound's falling in.” 
In the US there are many CDs, films, novels, and songs titled ""The Sky is Falling"", but the majority refer to the idiomatic use of the phrase rather than to the fable from which it derives. Among the several references to the tale that do so is the title ""Chicken Little Was Right"" (1968), by the Californian rock band The Turtles, referring to the false sense of security that alarmism challenges, although the original story is not otherwise referenced in the lyrics. However, the song ""Livin' on the Edge"", from the album Get a Grip (1993) by Aerosmith, goes much further in the lines ""If Chicken Little tells you that the sky is falling,/ Even if it wasn't would you still come crawling/ back again? I'll bet you would, my friend."" A further example is the song ""Chicken Little""  (Fancy, 1997) by Idiot Flesh, especially in the refrain ""The sky is falling, gotta tell the king"" and the inclusion of the names of other characters from the story at the end.

Adaptations
Walt Disney Animation Studios has made two versions of the story. The first was Chicken Little, a 1943 animated short released during World War II as one of a series produced at the request of the U.S. government for the purpose of discrediting Nazism. It tells a variant of the parable in which Foxy Loxy takes the advice of a book on psychology (on the original 1943 cut, it is Mein Kampf) by striking the least intelligent first. Dim-witted Chicken Little is convinced by him that the sky is falling and whips the farmyard into mass hysteria, which the unscrupulous fox manipulates for his own benefit. The dark comedy is used as an allegory for the idea that fear-mongering weakens the war effort and costs lives. It is also one of the versions of the story in which Chicken Little appears as a character distinct from Henny Penny.
The second Disney film was the very loosely adapted Chicken Little, released in 2005 as an animated feature. It is an updated science fiction sequel to the original fable in which Chicken Little is partly justified in his fears. In this version, Foxy Loxy is changed from a male to a female, and from the main antagonist to a local bully. Another film adaptation was the animated TV episode ""Henny Penny"" (1999), which was part of the HBO series Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child. In this modern update, the story is given a satirical and political interpretation.
There have also been a number of musical settings. American composer Vincent Persichetti used the fable as the plot of his only opera, The Sibyl: A Parable of Chicken Little (Parable XX), op. 135 (1976), which premiered in 1985. Then in 2007 the singer and composer Gary Bachlund used the text of Margaret Free's reading version of ""Chicken Little"" (The Primer, 1910) with a similar teaching aim. Setting the text for high voice and piano, Bachlund noted in the score that he intends a reference to alarmism and its tragic consequences.
The folk tale's educative potential was also illustrated in the final episode of season 6 of the American TV sitcom, The Golden Girls  (May 4, 1991), where Dorothy, Blanche, Rose and Sophia perform a musical version of Henny Penny ending in increasing literacy in the school where one of them teaches. Although the show's aim was comic entertainment, it was followed in 1998 by Joy Chaitin and Sarah Stevens-Estabrook's light-hearted musical version of the fable, ""Henny Penny"". Designed for between six and a hundred junior actors, it has additional characters as optional extras: Funky Monkey, Sheepy Weepy, Mama Llama, Pandy Handy and Giraffy Laughy (plus an aggressive oak tree). 
In Singapore, a more involved musical was performed in 2005. This was Brian Seward's  The Acorn - the true story of Chicken Licken. It is a tale of mixed motivations as certain creatures (including some among the 'good guys') take advantage of the panic caused by Chicken Licken. 
Later in the UK the Guildhall School of Music and Drama pioneered a scheme to harness opera, in this case based on the tale of Henny Penny, as a tool for language education in primary schools. This was a participatory exercise whereby children took part in a production adapted in various European languages - French (Cocotte Chocotte), German (Hennig Pfennig), Spanish (Pollita Chiquita), Italian (Sabrina Gallina) - as well as using English.

Related stories
A very early example containing the basic motif and many of the elements of the tale is some 25 centuries old and appears in the Buddhist scriptures as the Daddabha Jataka (J 322). In it, the Buddha, upon hearing about some particular religious practices, comments that there is no special merit in them, but rather that they are ""like the noise the hare heard."" He then tells the story of a hare disturbed by a falling fruit who believes that the earth is coming to an end. The hare starts a stampede among the other animals until a lion halts them, investigates the cause of the panic and restores calm. The fable teaches the necessity for deductive reasoning and subsequent investigation.
The Australian author Ursula Dubosarsky tells the Tibetan version of the Jataka tale in rhyme, in her book The Terrible Plop (2009), which has since been dramatised, using the original title Plop!. In this version, the animal stampede is halted by a bear, rather than a lion, and the ending has been changed from the Tibetan original.
The Br'er Rabbit story, ""Brother Rabbit Takes Some Exercise"", is closer to the Eastern versions. In this story, Br'er Rabbit initiates the panic but does not take part in the mass flight, although Br'er Fox does. In this case it is Br'er Terrapin that leads the animals back to question Br'er Rabbit.

Summary
In Knowles's version, titled Nágray and Himál, a poor brahmin named Soda Ram, who has an ""ill-tempered"" wife, laments his luck. One day, he decides to go on a pilgrimage to Hindustan, since a local king gives five lachs of rupees to the poor. On his journey, he stops to rest for a while and a serpent comes from a spring nearby and enters his bag. He sees the animal and plans to spring a trap for his wife so that the snake will bite her. He returns home with the bag and gives it to his wife. The woman opens the bag as the serpent spring out of it and turns into a human boy. The couple raises the boy, named Nágray, and become rich.
The boy shows incredible wisdom for his young age. One day, he asks his father where he can find ""a pure spring"" that he can bathe in, and Soda Rám points to a pool at princess Himal's garden, heavily guarded by the king's troops. He says he will find a way: he approaches an opening in the wall, changes into a serpent to crawl through and returns to human form. The princess hears some noise coming from the direction of the pool and questions for the strange presence. Nágray turns back into a snake and slithers away. He returns to the pool twice, and on the third time princess Himal notices his beauty, and falls in love with him. Himal sends a maid to follow the snake and sees it enter Soda Ram's house.
Princess Himal tells her father she will marry no other than the son of brahman Soda Ram. Soda Ram is called to the king's presence to deal with the wedding arrangements. The king suggests his prospective son-in-law should come in a regal and magnificent wedding procession. Nágray instructs his adoptive father to toss a paper in a certain spring, one hour before the wedding, and the procession will come. Himal and Nágray marry and live in a palace built near a river.
However, Nágray's other wives, which live in the realm of snakes, decide to pay a visit to the human princess, under a magical disguise, due to their lordship's extended absence. One of them uses a disguise of a glass seller to sell her wares to the palace. Nágray finds the utensils and destroys each of them, forbidding his human wife to buy any other. The second snake wife dons the guise of a sweeper. She tells Himal her husband was Nágray, also a sweeper (a man of a lower caste). The false sweeper gives Himal instructions on how to prove his origins: throw him in a spring and, if he sinks, he is not a sweeper.
Himal tells Nágray of the encounter and he admonishes her. But she insists he proves his caste. He enters the spring and slowly sinks in, until he disappears. Himal, then, is left alone and without a husband.  She returns to her palatial home, mounts a caravanserai and begins to give alms to the poor. On one occasion, a poor man and his daughter pay her a visit and tell that, in a jungle, they came across a spring. From this spring, an army marched out and set out a dinner for their king. Soon after, the army returned to the spring and this king gave them some alms, ""in the name of foolish Himal"".
With renewed hope, princess Himal asks the man to guide her to this location. They rest for the night, as Himal, still awake, sees Nágray coming from the spring. She begs him to return to their wedded life together, but Nágray warns of the danger of his snake wives. He turns her into a pebble and takes her to the watery kingdom. The snake wives notice the object and tell their husband to turn it back to human shape.
The snake wives decide to set Himal as their housekeeper. They tell her she must boil the milk for their serpentine children, and to knock the pots down. However, Himal knocks down the pots while the milk is still boiling hot, and, as the serpent children drink the milk, they die. Their serpentine mothers, overwhelmed with grief, turn into serpents and bite Himal. A grieving Nágray places her corpse on top of tree, alternating visits between her resting place and the spring.
One day, a holy man climbs up the tree and sees the corpse of Himal, still beautiful as she was in life. He prays to Náráyan and she returns to life. The holy man takes her to his home. Nágray, noticing its disappearance, begins a search and finds her at the holy man's house. While she was sleeping, Nágray enters the bedroom in his serpentine form and coils around her bedpost. The holy man's son, unaware of the serpent's nature, takes a knife and cuts the serpent into two pieces. Himal awakes startled and sees the serpent's corpse, lamenting her husband's death.
Nágray's corpse is burned, and Himal throws herself into the funeral pyre to die with him. However, deities Shiva and Parvati reunite both lovers by resurrecting their ashes in a magical spring.

Written history
The story of Himal and Nagaray is considered to be a ""well-known tale"", representative of the Kashmiri region.
Indian scholarship states that the tale has existed in the oral repertoire of the Kashmir region, with multiple renditions appearing in both Persian and Kashmiri in the 18th and 19th centuries. According to S. L. Sadhu, the earliest recorded version of the story was by Maulvi Sadr-ud-Din in Persian with the title Qasai Heemal va Arzun.
Local Kashmiri poet Waliullah Mattu (or Wali Ullah Mot) translated the story as a masnavi in the Kashmiri language. In Mot's version of the mathnavi Himal Negyray, Himal is Balavir's daughter and comes from Balapore/Balapur, while snake-prince Negyray from Talpatal (the netherworld). After being adopted by a human Pandit, Negyray marries a serpent-princess, then meets and marries human lady Himal. His disappearance is caused when Himal forces him to take a dip in a bowl of milk, which transports him back to Talpatal. At the end of the story, Himal plunges herself into Negyray's funeral pyre.
Knowles also informed that another version existed with the title Hímál Nágárajan, obtained from Pandit Hargopal Kol. He also noted that, in another version, Himal is a Hindu devotee, and falls in love with Nágray, an Islamic man.

Analysis
Name of the heroes
Indian scholar Suniti Kumar Chatterji proposed that Nagaray derives from the Sanskrit Nāga-rāja, meaning 'king of nagas' (a nāga is a mythical snake of Indian religion). As for the character of the princess, he considered that her name means ""Jasmine-garland"", corresponding to Sanskrit Yūthī-mālā and Prakrit Yūhīmāla.
According to professor Ruth Laila Schmidt, the hero's name, Nágráy (Nāgarājā 'snake king'), indicates remnants of snake worship in the Western Himalayas (including the Kashmir region), that is, worship of the nagas, snake-like beings of Hindu mythology associated with water. Also, the Kashmiri word for water spring is nāg, another link between water bodies and nagas as water-spirits.

Parallels
Suniti Kumar Chatterji also noticed some resemblance between the Kashmiri tale and the Lithuanian folktale Eglė the Queen of Serpents, wherein a human maiden named Egle marries Zilvinas, a snake-like prince that lives in an underwater palace.

Relation to other folktales
The tale has been compared to folktales of type ATU 425, ""The Search for the Lost Husband"", of the international classification of folktales. In Stith Thompson and Warren Roberts's Types of Indic Oral Tales, the tale is classified under its own Indic type, 425D Ind, ""Search for Serpent Husband"".

Legacy
The tale was also adapted into an opera by Kashmiri poet Dinanath Nadim.

The oldest manuscript found in Nepal has been dated to the 14th century, and its content and style has been traced to the ancient Sanskrit treatises called the Panchatantra from much earlier.: ix–xiv

The author and his sources
The authorship of the Hitopadesa has been contested. 19th-century Indologists attributed the text to Vishnu Sharma, a narrator and character that often appears in its fables. Upon the discovery of the oldest known manuscript of the text in Nepal, dated to 1373, and the preparation of a critical edition, scholars generally accept the authority of its two concluding verses. These verses mention Narayana as the author and a king called Dhavala Chandra as the patron of the text.: ix–xiv  But as no other work by this author is known, and since the ruler mentioned has not been traced in other sources, we know almost nothing of either of them. Dating the work is therefore problematic. There are quotations within it from 8th century works and other internal evidence may point to an East Indian origin during the later Pala Empire (8th-12th century).
Narayana says that the purpose of creating the work is to encourage proficiency in Sanskrit expression (samskrita-uktishu) and knowledge of wise behaviour (niti-vidyam). This is done through the telling of moral stories in which birds, beasts and humans interact. Interest is maintained through the device of enclosed narratives in which a story is interrupted by an illustrative tale before resuming. The style is elaborate and there are frequent pithy verse interludes to illustrate the points made by the various speakers. On account of these, which provide by far the greater part of the text, the work has been described as an anthology of (sometimes contradictory) verses from widespread sources relating to statecraft.
The Hitopadesha is quite similar to the ancient Sanskrit classic, the Panchatantra, another collection of fables with morals. Both have an identical frame story, although the Hitopadesha differs by having only four divisions to the ancient text's five. According to Ludwik Sternbach's critical edition of the text, the Panchatantra is the primary source of some 75% of the Hitopadesha's content, while a third of its verses can be traced to the Panchatantra. In his own introductory verses, Narayana acknowledges that he is indebted to the Panchatantra  and 'another work'. The latter is unknown but may possibly be the Dharmasastras or some other.: xii–xv

Contents
The Hitopadesha is organized into four books, with a preface section called Prastavika. The opening verse expresses reverence to the Hindu god Ganesha and goddess Saraswati. There are several versions of the text available, though the versions are quite similar unlike other ancient and medieval era Hindu texts wherein the versions vary significantly.: ix–x, xvi–xviii  The shortest version has 655 verses, while the longest has 749 verses.: ix–x, xvi–xviii  In the version translated by Wilkins, the first book of Hitopadesha has nine fables, the second and third each have ten, while the fourth has thirteen fables.

Book 1 Mitralabha: How to gain a friend
The Book 1 is introduced with the statement that wise and sincere friends may be poor or destitute, but it is they who may help one achieve successes in life. The book recommends that the good find good friends, they are like a vessel in which one deposits both joys and sorrows of life, and it is not words that define a friend but their behavior and actions.: 13–17

Book 2 Suhrdbheda: How to lose a friend
The Book 2 is introduced with the statement that great friendships can be destroyed by the cruel and envious beings who envy such friendship. The book states that misinformation creates wedge between friends, as does a focus on disagreements, rash action without due investigation and a lack of communication.: 75–84

Book 3 Vigaraha: War
The third book presents a series of fables wherein war is described as a consequence of greed, criticism of others, wicked people and their ideologies, cruel and ungrateful leader, lack of restraint, lack of preparation, poor fortifications, weak military, weak diplomacy, and poor counsel.

Book 4 Sandhi: Peace
The fables in Book 4 state that it is always better to seek peace with seven types of people: the truthful, the virtuous, the just, the strong, the victorious, those with many brothers, and the self-destructing worthless. Peace can be achieved, states Hitopadesha, if one examines one's own behavior and one's own seeking as much as that of the opponent, pays attention to the counsel of one's good friends, treats the opponent with respect and understanding that is in tune with the opponent's character, forms one or more of sixteen types of treaties, reciprocal assistance and cooperative ventures between the two sides thereby enabling the pursuit of truth.: 227–230

Translations
By the early 20th-century, translations of the Hitopadesha into the following Indian languages were known:: ix–xi 

Eastern states of India: Bangla, Odiya
Western states: Gujarati
Central states: Marathi
Northern states: Hindi, Newari, Urdu
Southern states: Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu
The text has also been widely translated under different titles into Asian languages such as Burmese, Khmer, Thai, Malay, Persian, Sinhala, as well as into Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Spanish and Russian.: ix–xi 
Akbar (1542–1605) commended the work of translating the Hitopadesha to his own minister, Abul Fazl, with the suggestion that the poems which often interrupt the narrative should be abridged. Fazl accordingly put the book into a familiar style and published it with explanations under the title of the Criterion of Wisdom.
The Hitopadesha was also a favourite among the scholars of the British Raj. It was the first Sanskrit book to be printed in the Nagari script, when it was published by William Carey in Serampore in 1803–4, with an introduction by Henry Colebrooke. This was followed by several later editions during the 19th century, including Max Müller's of 1884, which contains an interlinear literal translation.
Much earlier, Sir William Jones encountered the work in 1786 and it was translated into English the following year by Charles Wilkins, who had also made the earliest English translation of the Bhagavad Gita. A later translation by Edwin Arnold, then Principal of Puna College, was published in London in 1861 under the title The Book of Good Counsels.

Synopsis
A king and queen, at bed at night, heard a howl.  The king thought it was a tiger, and the queen a jackal. They argued. The king said that if it were a jackal, he would leave the kingdom to her; if it were a tiger, he would send her away and marry another woman. Then he summoned the guards to settle it. The guards decided they had to agree with the king or get in trouble, so they said it was a tiger.
The king abandoned the queen in the forest. A farmer gave her shelter, and she gave birth to a son, Ameer Ali. When he was eighteen, Ameer Ali set out to have adventures. He shot at a pigeon and broke an old woman's pot, so he gave her the brass pot he carried, and fetched water for her. He briefly saw a beautiful young woman in her hut. In the morning, she told him that if he ever needed aid, he would call the fairy of the forest. He thought only of the beautiful young woman.
He went to the king's palace and entered his service. One stormy night, a woman was heard wailing outside. The king ordered a servant to find out what it was, but the servant begged to be let off.  Ameer Ali offered to go.  He found a woman wailing beneath a gallows, though she was in reality an ogress. She told Ameer Ali that the body was her son's. When he tried to get it down for her, she tried to catch him, but he stabbed her and she fled, leaving behind an anklet. He told the king his story. The king gave the anklet to his proud and spoiled daughter.
She had two talking birds, a parrot and a starling. The starling thought the anklet became her. The parrot said her legs did not match. The princess demanded of her father a matching anklet. The king ordered Ameer Ali to find another within a month or die. With only a week left, Ameer Ali thought to call on the fairy of the forest. The beautiful young woman appeared. She told him to arrange wands, and then cut off her foot; the blood would make jewels. Then he would put back the foot and switch the wands, and she would be well again. Unwillingly, he obeyed her, and got the jewels. He was easily able to find someone to set them.
The starling admired the pair, but the parrot said she had all the beauty at one end. The princess demanded a necklace and bracelets from her father, and the king demanded them of Ameer Ali. By the same means, he had them made.
The parrot now complained that she dressed up for herself alone; she should marry. The princess told her father that she wanted to marry Ameer Ali. He agreed. Ameer Ali refused, and the king threw him into prison, although he thought his daughter should still marry, so he sent for men fit for a bridegroom and a royal heir.
The farmer joined the throng and made a petition: telling the king to remember that the tiger lived in the forest while the jackals hunted anywhere food could be found. He explained how he had found the queen and Ameer Ali was her son, and the king was ashamed of himself. He gave his throne to his son, who married the beautiful young fairy.

Legend
Jasma was a wife of Rooda who was a pond digger. They belonged to the Odh rajput tribe, a drifting tribe of laborers in Gujarat, Kathiawar, and some parts of Rajasthan. They were at Anhilwad Patan to dig Sahastralinga Tank, a lake and thousand shrines with lingam. Siddharaj Jaisinh, a king of Chaulukya dynasty, was captivated by the beauty of Jasma and proposed marriage. He offered to make her queen of Gujarat but she refused. Jaisinh killed her husband. She committed sati, by jumping into the pyre, to protect her honor. Her curse made the tank of Sahasralinga waterless and Siddharaj without an heir to his kingdom of Gujarat.
The Jasmadevi temple dedicated to her, constructed by the Odh rajput tribe in the 12th century, is situated near Sahasralinga Tank at Patan, Gujarat.

Popular culture
A Bhavai vesha, a folk theatre form based on legend, has been performed since the nineteenth century. It was recreated for a stage performance titled Jasma Odan by Shanta Gandhi in 1982. The 1926 Indian silent film Sati Jasma about the folk deity was created by Homi Master. It starred Gohar Mamajiwala and Khalil in the lead roles. A Gujarati film titled Sati Jasma Odan was directed by Chandrakant Sanghani in 1976. The songs of the film were penned by Kanti Ashok and music was composed by Mahesh Naresh.

Overview
Dating
Jātaka tales may be quite ancient. The term appears as part of a schema of Buddhist literary forms called the nine component genres of the Buddha's teaching (navaṅga-buddhasāsana), and depictions of them appear in early Indian art (as early as the second century BCE). They are also widely represented in ancient Indian inscriptions. According to Straube, ""the presumably oldest specimens of fully elaborated narratives are dispersed throughout the Vinayapiṭakas and Sūtrapiṭakas of the canonical collections of the different Buddhist schools. These texts are transmitted in various Indian dialects and stem from a prior oral tradition.""
Furthermore, while these texts cannot be dated in a precise manner, ""the fact that many narratives are passed on in almost identical form within the canons of the different schools shows that they date back to the time before the schisms between the schools took place."" Sarah Shaw, writing on the Pali Jātaka, states that the earliest part of the Jātaka, the verse portions, are ""considered amongst the very earliest part of the Pali tradition and date from the fifth century BCE"" while ""the later parts were incorporated during the period up to the third century CE.""
According to A. K. Warder, jātaka are the precursors to the various legendary biographies of the Buddha, which were composed at later dates. Although many jātaka were written from an early period, which describe previous lives of the Buddha, very little biographical material about Gautama's own life has been recorded. Jātaka tales also assimilate many traditional Indian fables and folklore that are not specifically Buddhist. As the genre spread outside of India, it also drew on local folk tales.

Literary features and themes
The Mahayana author Asaṅga provides a working definition of jātaka in his Śrāvakabhūmi:What is jātaka? That which relates the austere practices and bodhisattva practices of the Blessed One in various past births: this is called jātaka.The idea that jātaka are taught in order to illustrate the bodhisattva path is an ancient one and is contained in sources like the Mahavastu, which states: ""the supreme ones [Buddhas], who are skilled in jātakas and other doctrines, teach the course of practice of a bodhisattva.""
Many jātakas are told with a common threefold plot schema which contains:

a ""narrative in the present"" (paccupannavatthu), with the Buddha and other figures,
a ""narrative in the past"" (atītavatthu), a story from a past life of the Buddha
a ""link"" (samodhāna) in which there is an ""identification of the past protagonists with the present ones.""
In the jātaka found in the Suttapitaka, which are almost always in prose, the Buddha is almost always depicted as a person of high rank in a past life (and not an animal). Some of these also include past lives of some of the Buddha's disciples. One famous example is the Pali Mahāparinirvāṇasūtra, which includes the story of Mahāsudarśana. Unlike Sutra collections, Vinaya sources like the Vinayavastu contain more varied jātakas, including ones in which the Buddha is depicted as an animal.
Many jātaka contain elements of both verse and prose. According to Martin Straube ""the division into canonical verses and postcanonical prose points to the old Indian narrative form of ākhyāna, which has a fixed wording of the stanzas only, whereas the actual story is to be shaped anew during each oral performance."" The plots of the jātaka range from simpler Aesopic style animal tales to longer more complex dramas which resemble epics or novels with intricate dialogue, characters and poetry. Despite the diversity of the plots and characters, they are all unified by the character of the heroic bodhisattva Gautama (whose identity is generally only revealed at the end of the story) and his struggles on the quest for awakening. In spite of this, Gautama is not always the central character of all these stories and sometimes only plays a minor role. Other recurring characters include important disciples of the Buddha, Devadatta (generally as a villain) and members of Gautama's family, like his wife Yasodharā and son Rāhula.
Another important element of the stories are the various Buddhist virtues, called perfections, that were cultivated by the bodhisattva Gautama throughout his previous lives, and which serve as the lessons taught by the jātakas. Other jātakas, such as those found in the Buddhavaṃsa (Chronicle of Buddhas), focus on Gautama's meeting, serving and venerating past Buddhas and serve to place his bodhisattva path in a chronology of past Buddhas. These stories generally focus on acts of devotion to past Buddhas and how this generates much merit which many positive outcomes in the future. A smaller number of jātakas illustrate various mistakes or bad actions that the bodhisattva committed in a past life (and the subsequent karmic retribution) and thus demonstrate the bodhisattva's past imperfections.
Regarding the intended audience of these texts, Martin Straube notes that even though there is a widespread view that jātakas arose due to monks ""catering to the needs and tastes of the illiterate lay practitioners of Buddhism as propagandistic means of preaching or converting"" there is no historical evidence for this. Instead, the opposite might be true, since ""the prose portions of the Pali jātakas not infrequently have as their audience monks and nuns, who sometimes reach high levels of spiritual realization after listening to a jātaka story."" Naomi Appleton, in her analysis of the second and fourth decade of the Avadānaśataka, notes that both sets of stories ""assume a monastic audience."" Likewise, Kate Crosby writes that ""the format of the Jātaka in fact suggests that their original inclusion in the canonical collection was primarily for the benefit of monks."" Crosby notes that many of these stories are connected with monastic behavior and decorum, some of them are also meant to illustrate specific rules in the Vinaya. In spite of this main intended audience, their simple format also made them easily adaptable for other uses. Thus, they were repackaged as artistic entertainment and teaching devices for laypersons, as parittas (protective chants) and as chronicle (vamsa) literature.
Straube also notes that the rock caves of Ajanta and Bagh were inhabited by monks and it was them who ordered and directed the jātaka murals found there. There is also evidence from inscriptions on old stūpas at various Indian sites (such as Sanchi and Bharhut) with jātaka motifs which indicate that they were built due to the patronage of monks and nuns, some of them of high rank such as bhāṇaka (reciter). Some scholars have also concluded that Jātaka reciters were part of their own division of reciters.

History
Jātakas were originally transmitted in prakrit languages and various forms of Sanskrit (from classical to Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit). They were then translated into central Asian languages (such as Khotanese, Tocharian, Uighur, and Sogdian). Various jātaka stories and source texts were also translated into Chinese and Tibetan for the Tibetan and Chinese Buddhist canons. They were some of the first texts to be translated into Chinese. Kāng Sēnghuì (who worked in Nanking c. 247) was one of the first Chinese translators of Jātakas. Perhaps his most influential translation is the Scripture of the Collection of the Six Perfections.

The various Indian Buddhist schools had different collections of jātakas. The largest known collection is the Jātakatthavaṇṇanā of the Theravada school. In Theravada Buddhism, the Jātakas are a textual division of the Pāli Canon, included in the Khuddaka Nikaya of the Sutta Pitaka. The term Jātaka may also refer to a traditional commentaries (Atthakatha) on this book. The tales are dated between 300 BCE and 400 CE.
The Mahāsāṃghika Caitika sects from the Āndhra region also had Jātakas as part of their canon and they are known to have rejected some of the Theravāda Jātakas which dated past the time of King Ashoka. The Caitikas claimed that their own Jātakas represented the original collection before the Buddhist tradition split into various lineages.
In the Northern Buddhist tradition, Jātakas eventually came to be composed in classical Sanskrit. Perhaps the most influential and important Sanskrit Jātaka text is the Jātakamālā (Garland of Jātakas) of Āryaśūra which includes 34 Jātaka stories. This work differs from earlier sources in that it is a highly sophisticated poem which makes use of various Sanskrit literary devices. The Jātakamālā was quite influential and was imitated by later authors who wrote their own jātakamālās, mainly Haribhaṭṭa and Gopadatta. These works are all written in a classical Sanskrit genre known as campū, which is a blend of prose and verse in various meters. The jātakamālās all also use the six perfections (pāramitā) as their main framework. The influence of the jātakamālās can be seen in the Ajanta Cave complex, where illustrations of Jātakas are inscribed with quotes from Āryaśūra, with script datable to the sixth century. The Jātakamālā was also translated into Chinese in 434 CE. Borobudur, a massive 9th century Buddhist site in Java, contains depictions of all 34 Jatakas from the Jātakamālā.
Two other Sanskrit authors associated with the jātaka genre are Kumāralāta (2nd century CE), author of the Kalpanāmaṇḍitikā Dṛṣṭāntapaṅkti (Collection of Examples, Adorned with an Artistic Arrangement) and Saṅghasena's (date unknown) Pusa benyuan jing (菩薩本縁經; Sūtra of the Bodhisattva's Avadānas). Both works exist only in Chinese translation (but there are Sanskrit fragments). These texts are a kind of predecessor to the Jātakamālā and are less poetically sophisticated.
Later Sanskrit authors continued to write in the genre. One such late text is Kṣemendra's (c. 1036–1065) Bodhisattvāvadānakalpalatā (Wish-Fulfilling Creeper Consisting in Avadānas of the Bodhisattva), a unique jātaka text written completely in verse. This work was influential on the Tibetan tradition.
Jātaka are also important in Tibetan Buddhism. They were one of the main sources of teaching and study for the popular Kadam school and later Tibetan authors produced abridged collections such as Karmapa Rangjung Dorje's Hundred Births and Padma Chopel's summary of the Avadānakalpalatā.

Classic Jātaka sources
There are numerous sources for classic or canonical Jātaka tales, including:

The various Vinayapiṭakas and Sūtrapiṭakas of the different canons of the early Buddhist schools
The Gandharan Buddhist texts contain many Jātaka narratives, though here they are more commonly termed pūrvayogas (""former connection"")
The Jātakatthavaṇṇanā, the Theravada Jātaka collection (part of the Khuddaka Nikāya) contains 547 Jātakas in mixed verse (gāthās) and prose and was collected around 500 CE. It is preceded by the Nidānakathā, which is a biography of the Buddha which relates the stories to his life. It is the largest collection of Jātakas.

Many Mahayana sutras contain Jātakas embedded into them. For example, the Bodhisattvapiṭaka-sutra contains numerous Jātakas which are used to illustrate the various bodhisattva qualities. Likewise, Jātakas are an important element in the Large Prajñāpāramitā sutra, the Suvarṇaprabhāsa sūtra and the Bhadrakalpikasūtra. The Bhadrakalpikasūtra has a long section on the six perfections which includes around one hundred past life stories, including jātakas, pūrvayogas, and avadānas.
The Dà zhìdù lùn (大智度論) a massive Mahāyāna Buddhist treatise and commentary which survives in Chinese translation by Kumarajiva, contains numerous Jātakas which are used to illustrate the six perfections as well as other topics.
Kṣemendra's (c. 1036–1065) Bodhisattvāvadānakalpalatā (Wish-Fulfilling Creeper Consisting in Avadānas of the Bodhisattva)

Late Jātakas
Within the Pali tradition, there are also many non-canonical Jātakas of later composition (some dated even to the 19th century) but these are treated as a separate category of literature from the ""official"" Jātaka stories that have been more or less formally canonized from at least the 5th century — as attested to in ample epigraphic and archaeological evidence, such as extant illustrations in bas relief from ancient temple walls. Apocryphal Jātakas of the Pali Buddhist canon, such as those belonging to the Paññāsa Jātaka collection, have been adapted to fit local culture in certain South East Asian countries and have been retold with amendments to the plots to better reflect Buddhist morals. According to Kate Crosby, ""there is also a collection of Jātaka of ten future Buddhas, beginning with Metteyya, which though less well-known today clearly circulated widely in the Theravada world.""
There are also late compositions based on classic Jātakas, such as the Kavsiḷumiṇa, a poem based on the Kusa Jātaka in archaic Sinhala written King Parākkamabāhu II (13th century) and the Mahachat kham luang, the 'royal version' of the Vessantara jātaka, which was composed at the court of King Paramatrailokanātha (c. 1482). The art of putting classic Jātakas into Thai verse remains a living tradition to this day.

Important Jātakas
In Theravada
The Theravāda Jātakas comprise 547 poems, arranged roughly by an increasing number of verses. According to Professor von Hinüber, only the last 50 were intended to be intelligible by themselves, without commentary. The commentary gives stories in prose that it claims provide the context for the verses, and it is these stories that are of interest to folklorists. Alternative versions of some of the stories can be found in another book of the Pali Canon, the Cariyapitaka, and a number of individual stories can be found scattered around other books of the Canon. Many of the stories and motifs found in the Jātaka such as the Rabbit in the Moon of the Śaśajātaka (Jataka Tales: no.316), are found in numerous other languages and media.
The following list includes some important jātakas of the Pali tradition:

Āryaśūra's Jātakamālā
Āryaśūra's Jātakamālā, a very influential Sanskrit work that was depicted throughout the Buddhist world, contains the following Jātakas (which teach various virtues):

Jātakas in art and culture
Jātakas have been important as a way to spread Buddhist teachings and they were widely used as part of sermons, rituals, festivals, and various forms of art. Kate Crosby writes that they have been depicted in such varied forms as ""apocryphal literature, vernacular retellings, performance, temple art, temporary street and festival art, films, comics, and cartoons."" The sponsorship of Jātaka recitations, copyings and art eventually grew to be seen as an act which generated merit for lay Buddhists. These acts are more common around important festivals like Vesak.

The earliest archeological findings which depict Jātakas are the illustrations found in the on the Bharhut stupa railing as well as at Sanchi (c. late 2nd – 1st century BCE), which also include inscriptions. After this, Jātakas appear at many Buddhist sites, like at Ajanta. Similar Jātaka tales are found in murals of Silk Road sites of the pre-Tang period (ca. 421–640 C.E.), such as at Kucha. They are also found in early Southeast Asian sites, especially at Bagan sites. Burmese Buddhism has an extensive tradition of Jātaka illustration, one of the best examples being the illustrations found at Ananda Temple (which depicts 554 tales).

Jātaka tales are often associated with specific locations. Originally, this applied to specific places in India, which served as Buddhist pilgrimage sites. Later traditions expanded this to include other places throughout the Buddhist world. According to Naomi Appleton, the fact that Jātaka tales lack specific references to specific places allowed them to be easily transported and re-localized. This flexibility contributed to the lasting popularity of the Jātakas. This tradition of associating Jātaka tales with regions outside of India played an important part in the promotion and legitimisation of Buddhism in these regions.
Thus, many stupas in Nepal and northern India are said to mark locations from the Jātaka tales. Chinese pilgrims like Xuanzang and Faxian reported several of these and discussed the stories connected with them. Sites discussed by these figures include the ""four great stupas"" as well as stupas in Pushkalavati, Mangalura, Hadda Mountain, and Sarvadattaan.

According to Naomi Appleton, the ""four great stupas"" visited by Faxian (337–422 CE) are: the first (in 'So-ho-to') was where the Buddha ransomed the life of a dove with his own flesh; the second (in Gandhāra) was where he gave away his eyes to a blind beggar; and the third and fourth (in Takshaśilā) were where he gave away his head to a man and his whole body to a starving tigress who was about to eat her own cubs, and where 'kings, ministers, and peoples of all the kingdoms around vie with one another in making offerings'. A century later, Songyun writes of the same four sites and also mentions a whole area associated with the Vessantara-jātaka.

Artistic depictions at major sites
Numerous Indian Buddhist archeological sites contain illustrations of Jātakas, and thus they are important artistic sources for Jātakas. Some of the main sites include:

Ajanta Caves
Amaravati
Bagh Caves
Bharhut
Goli
Kanaganahalli
Mathura
Nagarjunakonda
Sanchi
Other ancient sites outside of India which contain Jataka illustrations include Borobudor, Dunhuang (the Mogao caves), Polonnoruwa, Anuradhapura, Bagan city, and Nakhon Pathom. Jataka illustrations (especially of the last 10 stories of the canonical Pali collection) are widespread in the Theravada Buddhist world, adorning many temples, wats and key sites.

Performance
According to the Chinese pilgrim Yijing, who visited India in the 7th century,  jātaka plays were performed 'throughout the five countries of India'. This culture of performance spread to other regions as well.
In Tibet, the Viśvāntara-jātaka was transformed into a popular play called the Dri med kun ldan. Other popular jataka plays include Nor bzaṅ or Sudhana and the story of Prince Maṇicūḍa (Lokānanda).
In Theravada countries, several of the longer tales such as ""The Twelve Sisters"" and the Vessantara Jataka are still performed in dance, theatre, puppetry, and formal (quasi-ritual) recitation. Such celebrations are associated with particular holidays on the lunar calendar used by Thailand, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Laos. The recitation of the Vessantara Jataka remains an important ceremony remains an important ceremony in Theravada countries today.

In other religions
Stories which are similar to the jātakas are also found in Jainism, which has stories focused on Mahavira's path to enlightenment in previous lives. The Jain stories include Mahavira's numerous forms of rebirth, such as animals as well as encounters with past liberated beings (jinas) which predict Mahavira's future enlightenment. However, a major difference here is that, while Mahavira gets a prediction of future enlightenment, he does not make a vow to become a jina in the future, unlike the bodhisattva Gautama. There is also no equivalent idea of a bodhisattva path in Jainism, in-spite of the existence of some narratives about Mahavira's past lives.
A similar collection of Indian animal fables is the Hindu Pañcatantra, which has been dated to around 200 BCE.
Some Buddhist jātakas were also adopted and retold by Islamic (and later Christian) authors, such as the 10th century Shia scholar Ibn Bābūya, who adapted a jātaka into a story titled Balawhar wa-Būdāsf, which became the Christian narrative of Barlaam and Joasaph.

Etymology and translation
Jinn is an Arabic collective noun deriving from the Semitic root JNN (Arabic: جَنّ / جُنّ, jann), whose primary meaning is 'to hide' or 'to adapt'. Some authors interpret the word to mean, literally, 'beings that are concealed from the senses'.
Cognates include the Arabic majnūn (مَجْنُون, 'possessed' or, generally, 'insane'), jannah (جَنَّة, 'garden', 'eden' or 'heaven'), and janīn (جَنِين, 'embryo').
Jinn is properly treated as a plural (however in Classical Arabic, may also appear as jānn, جَانّ), with the singular being jinnī (جِنِّيّ), which the English word ""genie"" is derived from.
The origin of the word jinn remains uncertain.(p22) Some scholars relate the Arabic term jinn to the Latin genius – a guardian spirit of people and places in Roman religion – as a result of syncretism during the reign of the Roman empire under Tiberius and Augustus; however, this derivation is also disputed.(p25) Supporters argue that both Roman genii as well as Arabian jinn are considered to be lesser deities inhabiting local sanctuaries, trees or springs, and persons or families. Aramaic ginnaya (Classical Syriac: ܓܢܝܐ) with the meaning of 'tutelary deity'(p24) or 'guardian' are attributed to similar functions and are another possible origin of the term jinn.
Another suggestion holds that the word is of Persian origin and appeared in the form of the Avestic Jaini, a wicked (female) spirit. Jaini were among various creatures in the possibly even pre-Zoroastrian mythology of peoples of Iran. Wensick advocates a purely Arabic origin of the term, asserting that according to the common Semitic view psychic and bodily affections are caused by spirits. An object reacting upon such an affect would be an incarnation of said spirit. Since these spirits are covered from the sight of humans, they would have been called jinn.(p45)
The anglicized form genie is a borrowing of the French génie, also from the Latin genius. It first appeared in 18th century translations of the Thousand and One Nights from the 1706 French edition,
where it had been used owing to its rough similarity in sound and sense and further applies to benevolent intermediary spirits, in contrast to the malevolent spirits called 'demon' and mostly-benevolent 'heavenly angels', in literature.
In Assyrian art, the modern term used for creatures ontologically between humans and divinities is also genie.
Though not a precise fit, descriptive analogies that have been used for these beings in Western thought include demon, spirit, ""sprite"", and fairy, depending on source.(p22)
In turn, the Arabic translation for the Greek nymph ('arūsa) is also used for jinn by Middle Eastern sources.(p43)
Although the term spirit is frequently used, it has been criticised for not capturing the corporeal nature of the jinn, and that the term genie should be used instead.

Pre-Islamic era
The exact origins of belief in jinn are not entirely clear.(pp 1–10) Belief in jinn in pre-Islamic Arab religion is testified not only by the Quran, but also by pre-Islamic Arabic poetry.(p54) Some scholars of the Middle East hold that they originated as malevolent spirits residing in deserts and unclean places, who often took the forms of animals;(p 1–10) others hold that they were originally pagan nature deities who gradually became marginalized as other deities took greater importance.(pp 1–10)

Fear and veneration
Jinn were already worshipped by many Arabs in pre-Islamic Arabia.(p54) Julius Wellhausen observed that jinn were often thought to ""inhabit or haunt desolate, dark and dingy places in the desert"". For that reason, they were held responsible for various diseases and mental illnesses.(pp 1–10) Emilie Savage-Smith asserts that malicious jinn and good gods were distinct in pre-Islamic Arabia, but admits that such distinction is not absolute.(p39) In the regions north to the Hejaz, Palmyra and Baalbek, the terms jinni and ilah (deity) were often used interchangeably. Julius Wellhausen likewise agrees that in pre-Islamic Arabia it was assumed there are at least some friendly and helpful beings among the jinn. He distinguishes between a god and a jinni, not on the basis of morality, but on the basis of worship; the jinn are worshipped in private while the gods are worshipped in public.(p39)
Al-Jahiz credits the pre-Islamic Arabs with believing that the society of jinn constitutes several tribes and groups, analogous to pre-Islamic Arabian culture. Jinn could also protect, marry, kidnap, possess, and kill people.(p 424) Despite being invisible, jinn are considered to have bodies (ajsām), as described by Zakariya al-Qazwini, they are among animals, along with humans, burdened beasts (like horses), cattle, wildebeests, birds, and reptiles.(p135) Jinn are further known as shapeshifters, often assuming the form of an animal, favoring the form of a snake. Other chthonic animals regarded as forms of jinn include scorpions and lizards. Both scorpions and serpents have been venerated in the ancient Near East.
When they shift into a human form however, they are said to stay partly animal and are not fully human.(p164) Although the power of jinn usually exceed those of humans, it is conceivable a man could kill a jinni in single combat, but they are feared for attacking without being seen. Some sources even speak of killed jinn leaving behind a carcass similar to either a serpent or a scorpion.

Poetry and soothsaying
Despite that they were often feared or inspired awe, the jinn were also pictured to befriend humans or have romantic feelings for them. According to common Arabian belief, pre-Islamic soothsayers, philosophers, and poets were inspired by the jinn.(pp 1–10)
The Arabian poet al-A'sha (d. after 3/625) is said to have gotten his inspiration for his poetry by a friend named Misḥal (""daʿawtu khalīlī Misḥalan"") and further calls him his jinni-brother (""akhī ʾl-jinnī""). Similarly, the poet Thābit (d. 54/674) who later converted to Islam and became known as ""the poet of the prophet"", referred to his jinni-friend as his ""sharp-sighted brother from the jinn"" (""wa-akhī min al-jinn al-baṣīr""). The relationship between jinn and humans can also be romantic in nature. According to one famous Arabian story, the jinni Manzur fell in love with a human woman called Habbah. He is supposed to have taught her the arts of healing.
The mutual relationship between jinn and humans is different than that of a jinni and a soothsayer (kāhin). The soothsayer is presented as someone who is totally controlled by the jinni entering. The soothsayer was consulted to reveal hidden information or settle disputes, as it was believed, the jinn speaking through them revealed hidden knowledge.

Islam
Jinn have been called  an integral part of the Muslim tradition or  faith,  completely accepted in official Islam;
prominently featured in folklore.   Medieval and modern scholars have studied the consequences implied by their existence,    legal status, the possible relations between them and mankind, especially in questions of  marriage and property.

Quran
Jinn are mentioned approximately 29 times in the Quran,(p21) exclusively in Meccan surahs. The Quran assumes that the audience is familiar with the subject without elaborating on the jinn much further. According to the Quran 51:56-57, Muhammad was sent as a prophet to both human and jinn communities, and prophets and messengers were sent to both communities.
Throughout the Quran, humans and jinn (al-ins wa-l-jinn) appear frequently as a pair, designating their equal status in regards of their creation and rejecting that jinn share divinity with the Creator.(p181) The term ins derives from anisa, which means ""to be familiar with"", and refers to recognisable familiar human beings. In contrast, the term jinn refers to foreign, invisible, or unknown anthropomorphic beings, which are nonetheless subject to the same considerations as the former.(p101) They were both created to worship God (51:56).(p182) Because they are supposed to worship God from free will, they are both able for good and evil deeds (7:179, 55:56).(p182) They are, like humans, rational beings formed of nations (7:38).(p182)
Surah al-jinn is about the revelation to jinn. The same Surah mentions righteous jinn on one hand, and malicious jinn on the other.(p181) The jinn can neither harm nor benefit humans, for they are occupied with looking after themselves and their own place in the cosmos.(p185) This is in notable contrast to demons and devils in the Judeo-Christian tradition.(p181, 185) The Quran does not condemn the jinn as a source of harm, but by mistaking them for beings deserving cultic veneration (72:6).(p41)(p185) Jinn and humans are blamed for ascribing divine attributes to another creature (i.e. jinn); jinn to themselves and humans to the jinn.(p41)(p102)
In the Quranic account, despite their similarities, there are important differences between the two species. Whereas humans are made from ""clay"" or ""dirt"", jinn were created from ""smokeless fire"" (Quran 15:27, Quran 55:15),(p182) which is possibly the reason why they are credited with some extraordinary abilities, such as invisibility, transformation, and ascending into the air like devils (Quran 72:8).(p182) Despite some superhuman powers, the jinn occupy no fundamentally different position in the Quran than humans. Like humans, the jinn have no knowledge of the future.(p182) Like humanity, jinn face epistemic limitations regarding ""the hidden/occult"", have to rely on God's messengers, and face eschatological judgement.(p182)

Exegesis
In Quranic interpretation, the term jinn can be used in two different ways:(p12)

a specific invisible being, offspring of abu Jann considered to be, along with humans, thaqalān (accountable for their deeds), created out of ""fire and air"" (Arabic: مَارِجٍ مِن نَّار, mārijin min nār).
any object that cannot be detected by human sensory organs, including angels, devils, and the (spiritual) interior of human beings.
Belief in jinn is not included among the six articles of Islamic faith, as belief in angels is. Nonetheless, many Muslim scholars, including the Hanbalī scholar ibn Taymiyya and the Ẓāhirī scholar ibn Hazm, believe they are essential to the Islamic faith since they are mentioned in the Quran.(p33) It is generally accepted by the majority of Muslim scholars that jinn can possess individuals. This is considered to be part of the doctrines (aqidah) of the ""people of the Sunnah"" (ahl as-sunnah wal-jammah'a) in the tradition of Ash'ari.(p 68) The Atharī scholars ibn Taimiyya and ibn Qayyim agree on this matter. From among the Sunni schools of theology, only the Māturīdīs seems to debate possession. Al-Rustughfanī deemed jinn-possession impossible.
Al-Māturīdī focuses on the dynamics between jinn and humans based on Quran 72:6. He states that seeking refuge among the jinn increases fear and anxiety, however, not because of the jinn, but due to the psychological dependence of the individual towards external powers. By that, he refers to seeking refuge among the jinn as a form of širk, due to the reliance on a created thing instead of God.(p23)
Although jinn frequently appear in hagiographic Sufi literature and their existence is never doubted, they do not play any major role in Sufi cosmology. Because of their similarities to humans, they function neither as a model to follow (like angels) nor tempters of the lower self (like Satan) and mostly feature in poetic anecdotes.

Jurisprudence
The jinn are obligated to follow the divine law (sharīʿa), as derived from the Quran by Muslim jurists (faqīh). Thus, the jinn are considered, along with humans, to be mukallāf. Believers among the jinn are called ""Muslim jinn"" (muslimū l-jinn).
Since both creations must perform the required prayers (salah), Muslim jurists debated if one is allowed to perform the prayer behind a jinni. Shibli cites two Hanbalite scholars who regard this as permissible without hesitation. Since Muhammad was sent to jinn and humans, both are mukallāf and subject to the command to pray.

Because humans and jinn are capable of procreation, Muslim jurists dealt with the issue of permissibility of intercourse between these two types of creatures. Some Ḥadīths, though considered fabricated (mawḍūʻ) by some muhaddith (hadith scholars), pushed the necessity for an explanation:""The Hour will come when the children of jinn will become many among you."" 
""Among you are those who are expatriated (mugharrabûn);"" and 
this, he explained, meant ""crossed with jinn.""
Although there are recorded cases of purported human-jinn relationships most Muslim jurists agree that such a relationship is not permissible. Even those scholars who allowed such relationships, still considered them undesirable (makruh). Offspring of human-jinn relationships are nonetheless, usually considered to be gifted and talented people with special abilities.

Folklore
The jinn (also known as: Albanian: Xhindi, Bosnian: Džin, Turkish: Cin) were adopted by later Islamic culture, since the Quran affirms their existence. Although depictions are categorized into little tradition (folklore) and greater tradition (official Islam) for research purposes, both depictions are largely the same.
The Quran does not consider foreign mythological beings to be devils, but entities erroneously ascribed divine power to. Therefore, jinn were considered a third class of invisible beings, often neutral or morally ambiguous, not consequently equated with devils. Islam allowed to integrate local beliefs about spirits and deities from Iran, Africa, Turkey and India, into a monotheistic framework without demonizing them. Besides local deities, the existence of purely malevolent spirits is also acknowledged. Thus, jinn exist alongside other mythological entities, such as demons (Dēw) and fairies (parī).
The moral attitude of the jinn is usually associated with their religion. Good jinn are usually considered Muslim jinn or jinn Islam, whereas unbelieving jinn were tempted by the devils (shayatin) and are called kāfir jinn or jinn kāfir. Besides Islam, they could also practise Christianity and Judaism. Good jinn might teach people moral lessons and might be benevolent, or aid spiritual persons, such as shamans (kam) in Central Asia, or spiritual healers in Senegal. Mediha Esenel's studies in 1940 Anatolia mentions the belief that spiritually gifted people can act as intermediaries between humans and jinn.
Most of the time, jinn are believed not to interfere with humans and live mostly in desolate or abandoned places. This is, for example, evident from the Turkish phrase İn Cin top oynuyor. It is only when they are angered or disturbed, for example, if their children are trodden upon or hot water is thrown on them, that they take revenge on humans. For this reason, Muslims utter ""destur"" (permission), before doing something which might accidentally hurt jinn, such as sprinkling hot water on public grounds or into bushes, so present jinn are advised to leave the place.(p149)
Angered or straightforwardly evil mannered jinn, could hurt people by inflicting physical damage, causing illness, or taking control over a human's body. A human can be controlled by jinn under certain circumstances. The individual needs to be in a state of dha'iyfah (Arabic: ضَعِيفَة, ""(mental) weakness""). Feelings of insecurity, mental instability, unhappy love and depression (being ""tired from the soul"") are forms of dha'iyfah. In that case, it is believed that an exorcism is required to save the person from the assaulting jinni. To protect oneself from jinn, many Muslims wear amulets with the name of God graved on. Jinn are also said to be scared of iron(pp 128, 250) and wolves.(p 34)(p 95)

Modern and post-modern era
Post-modern literature and movies
Jinn feature in the magical realism genre, introduced into Turkish literature by Latife Tekin (1983), who uses magical elements known from pre-Islamic and Islamic Anatolian lore. Since the 1980s, this genre has become prominent in Turkish literature. The story by Tekin deals with folkloric and religious belief in a rationalized society.
Contrary to the neutral to positive depiction of jinn in Tekin's novels, since 2004 jinn have become a common trope in Middle Eastern horror movies. The presentation of jinn usually combines Quranic with oral and cultural beliefs about jinn. Out of 89 films, 59 have direct references to jinn as the antagonist, 12 use other sorts of demons, while other types of horror, such as the impending apocalypse, hauntings, or ghosts, constitute only 14 films. The popularity of jinn as a choice of monster can best be explained by their affirmation in the Quran. They are still a popular trope today. A study from 2020 shows that jinn are still the favorite horror element among teenagers. Jinn further feature in Iranian horror movies.

Prevalence of belief
Though discouraged by some teachings of modern Islam, cultural beliefs about jinn remain popular among Muslim societies and their understanding of cosmology and anthropology. Affirmation on the existence of jinn as sapient creatures living along with humans is still widespread in the Middle Eastern world (including Egypt), and West Africa, mental illnesses are still often attributed to jinn possession. 
Since modern times, jinn were often portrayed in a more negative light. After the failure of the rebellion against the East India Company, the Muslim elite regarded jinn-veneration in India as a superstitional belief and hinders the common people to instigate military power. Similarly, the Deobandi movement, although not denying the reality of jinn, mostly depicts jinn as malevolent beings who need to be avoided or exorcised. In modern Iran, (evil) jinn are often substituted by devils. Similarly, in many modern tales, the term jinn is used for div (demon), causing a shift in meaning. Nonetheless, traditional belief in jinn remains popular in Islamic culture. The negative evaluations of jinn are not static, but rather entangled with traditional and also positive depictions of jinn.
According to a survey undertaken by the Pew Research Center in 2012:

The amount of Muslims believing in jinn from Bosnia and Herzegovina is higher than the general European average (30%), although only 21% believe in sorcery and 13% would wear talisman for protection against jinn; 12% support offerings and appeal given to the jinn.
Sleep paralysis is understood as a ""jinn attack"" by many sleep paralysis sufferers in Egypt, as discovered by a Cambridge neuroscience study Jalal, Simons-Rudolph, Jalal, & Hinton (2013). The study found that as many as 48% of those who experience sleep paralysis in Egypt believe it to be an assault by the jinn. Almost all of these sleep paralysis sufferers (95%) would recite verses from the Quran during sleep paralysis to prevent future ""jinn attacks"". In addition, some (9%) would increase their daily Islamic prayer (ṣalāh) to get rid of these assaults by jinn. Sleep paralysis is generally associated with great fear in Egypt, especially if believed to be supernatural in origin.
Similarly, European patients with a Muslim background often attribute mental illnesses to jinn. Most common attributations to jinn are symptoms of hallucination and psychotic symptoms, but can also include mood disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Capgras syndrome, and epilepsy.
It has been noted that not all Muslims who believe in jinn, believe they can possess people. Furthermore, belief in possession is not limited to Muslims. Contrary to the assumption that higher education is proportional to disenchantment, belief in jinn-possession may remain intact even after medical graduation.
In the proccess of objectification of Islam occurring especially among Muslims in the diaspora, folkloric depictions of jinn become less common and increasingly viewed as ""local beliefs"" or ""un-Islamic"". Stories and beliefs regarding jinn, are often downplayed in favor of a normative approach to religion.

Visual art
Although there are very few visual representations of jinn in Islamic art, when they do appear, it is usually related to a specific event or individual jinn.
Visual representations of jinn appear in manuscripts and their existence is often implied in works of architecture by the presence of apotropaic devices like serpents, which were intended to ward off evil spirits. Lastly, King Solomon is illustrated very often with jinn as the commander of an army that included them.

Architectural representation
In addition to these representations of jinn in vicinity to kingship, there were also architectural references to jinn throughout the Islamic world. In the Citadel of Aleppo, the entrance gate Bab al-Hayyat made reference to jinn in the stone relief carvings of serpents; likewise, the water gate at Ayyubid Harran housed two copper sculptures of jinn, serving as talismans to ward off both snakes and evil jinn in the form of snakes.(p408)
Alongside these depictions of the jinn found at the Aleppo Citadel, depictions of the jinn can be found in the Rūm Seljuk palace. There are a phenomenal range of creatures that can be found on the eight-pointed tiles of the Seal of Sulaymān device.(p390) Among these were the jinn, that belonged among Solomon's army and as Solomon claimed to have control over the jinn, so did the Rūm Seljuk sultan that claimed to be the Sulaymān of his time.(p393) In fact, one of the most common representations of jinn are alongside or in association with King Solomon. It was thought that King Solomon had very close ties to the jinn, and even had control over many of them.(p399) The idea that a great and just ruler commands jinn was also extended to other emperors, such as Alexander the Great.(p399)
Given this association, jinn were often seen with Solomon in a princely or kingly context, such as the small, animal-like jinn sitting beside King Solomon on his throne illustrated in an illuminated manuscript of Aja'ib al-Makhluqat by Zakariya al-Qazwini, written in the 13th century.

Talismanic representation
The jinn had an indirect impact on Islamic art through the creation of talismans that were alleged to guard the bearer from the jinn and were enclosed in leather and included Qur'anic verses. It was not unusual for those talismans to be inscribed with separated Arabic letters, because the separation of those letters was thought to positively affect the potency of the talisman overall. An object that was inscribed with the word of Allah was thought to have the power to ward off evil from the person who obtained the object, though many of these objects also had astrological signs, depictions of prophets, or religious narratives.

In the Kitāb al-Bulhān
In the Book of Wonders compiled in the 14th century by Abd al-Hasan al-Isfahani, there are illustrations of various supernatural beings (demons, ʿafārīt, jinn, the evil eye, devils, lilith, celestial spirits, etc.).(p27)
Each celestial spirit is referred to as a ""King of the Jinn"", represented alongside his spiritual helpers and alongside the corresponding talismanic symbols.(p27) For instance, the 'Red King of Tuesday' was depicted in the Book of Wonders as a sinister form astride a lion. In the same illustration, he holds a severed head and a sword, because the 'Red King of Tuesday' was aligned with Mars, the god of war.(p27) Alongside that, there were illustrations of the 'Gold King' and the 'White King'.(p27)
Aside from the seven 'Kings of the Jinn', the Book of Wonders included an illustration of Huma (Arabic: حمى), or the 'Fever'. Huma was depicted as three-headed and as embracing the room around him, in order to capture someone and bring on a fever in them.(p28)

Magical practises
Jinn might be invoked, along with demons and devils, for means of sorcery, incantation, protection, or divination. Soothsayers (kāhin) are credited with the ability to ask jinn about things of the past, since their lives are believed to last longer than that of humans.(p73)
Common beliefs regarding sorcery and commanding jinn are attested in ibn al-Nadim's Kitāb al-Fihrist.(p141) Since he locates such practises not as a branch of science or philosophy, but rather in a chapter about stories and fables, the author might not have believed in the efficiency of sorcery himself.(p141) He reports that the art of commanding jinn and demons is traced back to Solomon and Jamshid. The first who would have practised a lawful method of incantation is supposed to be Abū Naṣr Aḥmad b. Hilāl during the Umayyad period.(p142) Ibn Nadim explains lawful and unlawful subjugating of jinn and demons as distinct: While the former controls the jinn by the power of God's divine names, the latter pleases demons and devils by prohibited offerings and sinful acts.(p141–142)  According to al-Jāḥiẓ, ibn Hilāl is said to have the power to summon demons and jinn(p142) and further claimed to have married a daughter of Satan and begotten a child.(p143)
There is evidence that subjugation of spirits, jinn, and demons, was also cultivated by various Islamic authorities. Al-Ṭabasī, who was considered a reliable muḥadīth (scholar of ḥadīth) and pious ascetic, wrote an extensive treatise (al-Shāmil fī al-baḥr al-kāmil) on subjugating demons and jinn.(p145) According to Zakariya al-Qazwini, it was well known that jinn obeyed al-Ṭabasī. He gives an example, that al-Ṭabasī demonstrated the jinn to the famous scholar Ghazālī, who saw them as shadows on the wall.(p145) He professes that jinn only obey when the individual turns away from the temptations of creation and devoting oneself towards God.(p146) The al-Shāmil gives detailed instructions for preparations of various incantations. Unlike, for example in the writings of al-Razi, the al-Shāmil has no direct link to Hellenistic or Hermetic magic or philosophy.(p148) Magic was also used in the Ottoman Empire as evident from the Talismanic shirts of Murad III.
Related to the occult traditions in Islamic culture is the belief in the ""Seven kings of the Week"", also known as rūḥāiya ulia (higher spirits; angels) and rūḥāiya sufula (lower spirits; demons). These beings are, for example, invoked for the preparation of Magic squares.(p87) This belief is attested by the Book of Wonders. It contains artistic depictions of several supernatural beings (demons, jinn, the evil eye, fever (Huma, Arabic: حمى), devils, lilith, etc.). Some of these beings indicate that the work connects Hebrew, Christian, and Islamic magical traditions. The original work is attributed to al-Bakhi, who founded a system of astrological magic based on Neo-Platonic thought. Although many pages are damaged, it is possible to reconstruct their meanings from Ottoman copies. Each king is depicted with helpers and associated talismanic symbols.

Comparative mythology
In comparative mythology and historical context studies, Quranic studies scholars discuss the relationship between Islamic notions of jinn and earlier Jewish and Christian ideas of supernatural beings or preternatural creatures, especially those of angels, spirits, and demons. It is widely agreed that the belief in jinn was a common element of the culture out of which the Quran came. One question has concerned the degree to Quranic jinn might be compared to fallen angels in Christian traditions, although issues with this view are that jinn are not identified as ""angels"" and that descriptions of angels do not involve their flying up the sky to eavesdrop on heavenly secrets (unlike jinn who do so in Surah 72). Patricia Crone notes that, like jinn, the demons of the Testament of Solomon ascend to the firmament and eavesdrop on heavenly secrets; as did demons of Zoroastrian cosmology, who in addition encounter a heavenly defense systems (as did Islamic jinn). Similar statements are also found in the Talmud (Berakhot 18b) and the 8th-century Scolion of Theodore bar Konai.
Counterparts to Quranic jinn have been identified in the Book of Jubilees, where spirits created by God, associated with fire, having an identified leader (Mastema), may either aid or harm humans, and suffer a similar fate as the jinn. 
The Shedim of the Tanakh are said to resemble jinn.(p120) Like jinn, among a class of beings of Jewish mythology/belief (jnun, shedim, etc.), there is a tradition of ritual exorcism and negotiations that differs from that of traditional Jewish cure of spirit possession associated with ghosts (Dybbuk).
Jinn have also been compared to preternatural beings called gny' in inscriptions from Palmyra as well as broader late antique demonologies.

Synopsis
A rajah made a jogi welcome in his city, building a house where he might receive guests.  The rajah's only child was a beautiful daughter, who was betrothed to a neighboring prince.  One day this daughter visited the jogi, who was instantly attracted to her.  She guessed his intention and fled, and the jogi threw a lance after her, wounding her in the leg.
The next day, the jogi claimed to have been visited by a demon, which came disguised as a beautiful young woman but transformed into a hideous monster.  The rajah had to find a beautiful young woman with a lance wound.  When he did so, and realized it was his daughter, the jogi declared that his true daughter had been replaced in infancy by this evil spirit.  The king made a chest, and they put the daughter in it and threw it in the river.  
The next morning, her betrothed was hunting by the river and found the chest.  He freed her and found that she was his betrothed.  They married on the spot.  The prince had a great monkey put in the chest in the princess's place, and the chest put back in the river.  The jogi had his pupils retrieve it and then ordered them not to come into the room, whatever screams they heard.  He took out a silken cord to strangle the princess.  Shortly thereafter, they heard screams for help but did not enter.  Eventually they did and found the jogi's body.  
When the princess heard the jogi was dead, she made her peace with her father.

Evolution of descriptions
An early description of the karkadann comes from the 10/11th century Persian scholar Al-Biruni (973–1048). He describes an animal which has ""the build of a buffalo...a black, scaly skin; a dewlap hanging down under the skin. It has three yellow hooves on each foot...The tail is not long. The eyes lie low, farther down the cheek than is the case with all other animals. On the top of the nose there is a single horn which is bent upwards."" A fragment of Al-Biruni preserved in the work of another author adds a few more characteristics: ""the horn is conical, bent back towards the head, and longer than a span...the animal's ears protrude on both sides like those of a donkey, and...its upper lip forms into a finger-shape, like the protrusion on the end of an elephant's trunk."" These two descriptions leave no doubt that the Indian Rhinoceros is the basis for the animal. But the future confusion between the rhinoceros and the unicorn was already in the making since the Persian language uses the same word, karkadann, for the mythological animal as it does for the rhinoceros, and this confusion is evident also in the illustrations of the creature.
After Al-Biruni, Persian scholars took his description and formed ever more fanciful versions of the beast, aided by the absence of first-hand knowledge and the difficulty of reading and interpreting old Arabic script. A decisive shift in description concerned the horn: where Al-Biruni had stuck to the short, curved horn, later writers made it a long, straight horn, which was shifted in artists' representations from the animal's nose to its brow.
The Persian physician Zakariya al-Qazwini (Al-Qazwini, d. 1283) is one of the writers who at the end of the thirteenth century links the karkadann's horn with poison, in his Aja'ib al-Makhluqat. He lists a few beneficial effects: holding the horn opens up the bowels to relieve constipation, and it can cure epilepsy and lameness. Later authors had the horn perspire when poison is present, suggesting the horn is an antidote and connecting it to alicorn, though this connection is not made by all writers.
In the 14th century, Ibn Battuta, in his travelogue, calls the rhinoceros he saw in India a karkadann, and describes it as a ferocious beast, driving away from its territory animals as big as the elephant; this is the legend that is told in One Thousand and One Nights in the ""Second Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor"".
The karkadann is referred to by Elmer Suhr as the ""Persian version of the unicorn"". The name appears also in medieval European bestiaries, such as those from Escorial and Paris, where the name karkadann appears in the captions of unicorn illustrations.

Horn
Al-Qazwini, one of the earliest authors to claim the horn is an antidote to poison, also notes that it is used in the manufacturing of knife handles. According to Chris Lavers, The Natural History of Unicorns, khutu, a somewhat enigmatic material possibly consisting of ivory or bone, had been ascribed alexipharmic properties. Both of these ""enigmatic horns,"" Lavers argues, were used in making cutlery, and so became associated; this is how in the 13th century Al-Qazwini could consider karkadann horn as an antidote, and this is how the karkadann became associated with the unicorn.

Name
The name karkadann is a variation of the Kurdish name which means donkey with one horn [Kar kit Dan]. Persian kargadan, or Sanskrit kartajan, which is said to mean ""lord of the desert"". Fritz Hommel suspects that the word entered Semitic languages via Arabs from Abyssinia. Other spellings and pronunciations include karkaddan, kardunn, karkadan, and karkend.
It has been conjectured that the mythical karkadann may have an origin in an account from the Mahabharata.
The initial portion of Persian kargadan resembles the Sanskrit word ""khaRga"" for rhinoceros also meaning sword, where ""R"" represents a retroflex flap sound. The rhinoceros is ""sword horned"".

The karkadann in modern scholarship and culture
Scholarship on the karkadann
Much of the available material on the karkadann was collected by Richard Ettinghausen in his 1950 publication The Unicorn, a book highly praised and often referred to as a standard reference on the unicorn.

Notable appearances and references
The karkadann is the topic of a long poem by Tawfiq Sayigh (d. 1971), ""A Few Questions I Pose to the Unicorn,"" which was hailed by Jabra Ibrahim Jabra as ""the strangest and most remarkable poem in the Arabic language.""
Modern Iraq still has a tradition of ""tears of the karkadann,"" dumiu al-karkadan, which are reddish beads used in the Misbaha, the Muslim prayer beads (subuhat). The accompanying legend says that the rhinoceros spends days in the desert looking for water; when he does, he first weeps ""out of fatigue and thirst-pain."" These tears, as they fall into the water of the drinking hole, turn into beads.
Peter Beagle (author of The Last Unicorn) wrote a story, ""My Son Heydari and the Karkadann,"" in The Overneath (c)2017.

Author and structure
The author of Kathasaritsagara, or rather its compiler, was Somadeva, the son of Rāma, a Śaiva Brāhman of Kashmir. He tells us that his magnum opus was written (sometime between 1063-81 CE) for the amusement of Sūryavatī, wife of King Ananta of Kashmir, at whose court Somadeva was poet. The tragic history of Kashmir at this period - Ananta’s two sons, Kalaśa and Harṣa, the worthless degenerate life of the former, the brilliant but ruthless life of the latter, the suicide of Ananta himself, the self-immolation of Sūryavatī on his funeral pyre, and the resulting chaos - forms as a dark and grim background for the setting of Somadeva’s tales. The frame story is the narrative of the adventures of Naravahanadatta, son of the legendary king Udayana, his romances with damsels of great beauty and wars with enemies. As many as 350 tales are built around this central story, making it the largest existing collection of Indian tales.
Somadeva declares that his work is a faithful though abridged translation of a much larger collection of stories known as the Bṛhatkathā, or Great Tale written in the lost Paisaci dialect by Guṇāḍhya. But the Kashmirian (or ""Northwestern"") Bṛhatkathā that Somadeva adapted may be quite different from the Paisaci ur-text, as at least 5 apparent descendants of Guṇāḍhya's work exist — all quite different in form and content, the best-known (after the Kathāsaritsāgara itself) probably being the Bṛhatkathāślokasaṃgraha of Budhasvamin from Nepal. Like the Panchatantra, tales from the Kathāsaritsāgara (or its related versions) travelled to many parts of the world.
Kathāsaritsāgara consists of 18 lambhakas (""books"") of 124 taramgas (chapters called as ""waves"") and approximately 22,000 ślokas (distichs) in addition to prose sections. The śloka consists of 2 half-verses of 16 syllables each. Thus, syllabically, the Kathāsaritsāgara is approximately equal to 66,000 lines of iambic pentameter; by comparison, John Milton's Paradise Lost is 10,565 lines. All this pales in comparison to the (presumably legendary) 700,000 ślokas of the lost original Brihatkatha.
Somadeva’s narrative captivates both by its simple and clear, though very elegant, style and diction and by his skill in drawing with a few strokes pictures of types and characters taken from the real every-day life. Hence it is that even in the miraculous and fantastical facts and events that make up the bulk of the main story and of a great deal of the incidental tales the interest of the reader is uninterruptedly kept. His lively and pleasant art of story-telling — though now and then encumbered with inflatedness or vitiated by far-fetched false wit — is enhanced also by his native humor and the elegant and pointed sentences strewn about here and there with a good taste.

Synopsis
The Kathāsaritsāgara is a large work. Each book comprises a number of stories loosely strung together, by being narrated for the recreation or information of the same individuals, or arising out of their adventures. These are Udayana, king of Kosambi, and his son Naravahanadatta. The marriage of the latter with various damsels of terrestrial or celestial origin, and his elevation to the rank of king of the Vidyadharas, a class of heavenly spirits, are the leading topics of most of the books; but they merely constitute the skeleton of the composition, the substance being made up of stories growing out of these circumstances, or springing from one another with an ingenuity of intricacy which is one of the great charms of all such collections.

Book 1
The first book (Kathapitha) is introductory, and refers the origin of the tales contained in the collection to Shiva, who, it is said, related them in private conversation with his wife, Parvati, for her entertainment. One of the attendants of the deity, Pushpadanta, took the liberty of listening, and he repeated them, under the seal of secrecy, to his wife, Jaya, a sort of lady’s maid to the goddess. Jaya takes an opportunity of intimating to her mistress that she is acquainted with the stories narrated by Shiva to the great mortification of Parvati who had flattered herself that they had been communicated to her alone. She accordingly complains to Shiva of his having deceived her and he vindicates himself by discovering the truth. Parvati thereupon pronounces an imprecation upon Pushpadanta, condemning him to be born upon the earth as a man; and she sentences his friend Malyavan, who had ventured to intercede for him, to a like destination. Parvati tells the culprits that they shall resume their celestial condition when Pushpadanta, encountering a yaksha, a follower of Kubera, the god of wealth, doomed for a certain time to walk the earth, as a pishacha or goblin, shall recollect his own former state, and shall repeat to the pishacha the stories he overheard from Shiva; and when Malyavan, falling in with the Pisacha, shall hear from him again the stories that his friend Pushpadanta had narrated. The recitation of the stories forms also the limit of the pishacha’s sojourn amongst mortals.
The two demigods, Pushpadanta and Malyavan, are born as two Brahmins, named Vararuchi and Gunadhya, and their adventures as mortals constitute the subject of several tales. Some of these possess much local interest: we have in them literary anecdotes relating to celebrated works and authors, as to Panini the grammarian; notices of historical persons and events, as of the accession of Chandragupta Maurya; and traditions of the origin of celebrated places, as of that of Pataliputra. One of the best-told stories in the whole work occurs here. Upakosha the wife of Vararuchi, becomes during the absence of her husband, the object of the addresses of the king's family priest, the commander of the guards, the prince's tutor, and her husband's banker. She makes assignations with them all: each as he arrives is quickly followed by his successor, and is secreted only to be finally exposed and punished.
Malyavan, or Gunadhya, in consequence of a dispute with a rival Brahmin, forgoes the use of the Sanskrit, Prakrit and Deshya, or vernacular languages. He afterwards learns the Paisachi language, or that of the goblins, which enables him to receive the narrations as they are told him by the metamorphosed yaksha or pishacha. Gunadhya having heard the stories, extending to seven hundred thousand stanzas, wrote them with his blood, for there was no ink in the forest. He then offered the work to Satavahana, king of Pratishthana, who rejected it with abhorrence, on which the author kindled a fire in the forest, and reading it aloud, to the great edification of spirits and goblins, and birds and beasts, he burned it leaf by leaf as he finished the perusal. The news of this proceeding at last reached the king, and he repented of what he had done, and repaired to Gunadhya to solicit the gift of the work. The sage consented to present the king with the hundred thousand verses that had not yet been consigned to the flames. Satavahana took it to his capital, and having received an explanation of it from two of Gunadhya's disciples, he translated it from the language of the pishachas.

Books 2 to 5
The second book (Kathamukha) commences that part of the original narrative which was supposedly not consumed, and records the adventures of Udayana, king of Kosambi, a prince of great fame in Sanskrit plays and poems, and his marriage with Vasavadatta, princess of Ujjain. The major sub-stories include the tales of Sridatta, Devasmita and Lohajangha.
The third book (Lavanaka) describes his marriage to the second wife, Padmavati, princess of Magadha and his subsequent conquests. This book is especially rich in mythological sub-stories like Durvasa and Kunti, Urvashi and Pururavas, Indra and Ahalya, Sunda and Upasunda &c.
The fourth book (Naravahanadattajanana) narrates the birth of the son of Udayana, by Vasavadatta, Naravahanadatta; at the same time sons are born to the chief ministers of Udayana, and they become the companions and councilors of the young prince. The book contains the famous story of Jimutavahana.
The fifth book (Caturdarika) records the adventures of Saktivega who became king of the heavenly beings termed Vidyadharas, a class of spirits who reside upon the loftiest peaks of the Himalaya mountains. While a mortal, he possessed superhuman longevity and faculties including clairvoyance and extrasensory perception. Naravahanadatta, is prophecised to be a king of the Vidyadharas.

Book 6
The main focus of the sixth book (Madanamanchuka) is the marriage of the young prince Naravahanadatta with Madanamanchuka the daughter of Kalingasena, a princess whose mother is a celestial nymph. Kalingasena had been enamoured of Udayana, and desires to wed him. Udayana wants to marry her; but as he has two wives already, his chief minister argues against it. A friend of the princess, a nymph of air, is also opposed to the match, and a variety of tales are recited on either side in support of the reasoning for and against the union. In the end, a spirit of air, in love with the princess, assumes the form of Udayana, and in this identity weds her. She reconciles without remedy, and has a daughter, Madanamanchuka who is the bride of Udayana's son. The book features the famous story of Usha and Aniruddha.

Book 7
In the next book (Ratnaprabha) Naravahanadatta marries Ratnaprabhā a Vidyadhari who was prophesied to be his bride; the wedding is celebrated at the palace of her father Hemaprabha, on one of the snow-crowned summits of the Himalaya. When the married couple return to Kosambi the young bride persuades her husband to throw open the doors of the inner quarters, and allow free access to his friends and associates. “The honour of women,” she affirms, “is protected by their own principles alone; and where these are corrupt, all precautions are vain.” This arrangement not only emancipates the women from jealous restraint, but also triggers a subsequent series of tales, with the prince's companions as narrators. The stories that then ensue (for e.g. Somasvamin, Sringabhuja and Rupasikha) are about the conduct of women; some are tales of revenge.

Books 8 and 9
The eighth book (Suryaprabha) is devoted to the adventures of a prince named Suryaprabha, who became king of the Vidyadharas. The scene of action is mostly in the Lokas beyond earth, and the dramatis personae are the Nagas or snake-gods of Patala and the Vidyadharas. This is further illustration of the mode in which Naravahanadatta may fulfil the prophecy.
In the ninth book (Alamkaravati), Naravahanadatta is distraught on the disappearance of his favorite bride Madanamanchuka after throwing open the doors of the inner quarters. He is consoled by the narration of a number of stories about the temporary separation and final reunion of faithful couples. They consist of a compendious recital of the adventures of Nala and Damayanti. The stories continue till the thirteenth book.

Book 10
The next book (Saktiyasas), the tenth, is important in the history of literature, as it includes the whole of the Panchatantra. We also have in this book a possible inspiration of another well-known story, that of King Shahryar and His Brother in the One Thousand and One Nights. Two young Brahmins travelling are benighted in a forest, and take up their lodging in a tree near a lake. Early in the night a number of people come from the water, and having made preparation for an entertainment retire; a Yaksha, a genie, then comes out of the lake with his two wives, and spends the night there; when he and one of his wives are asleep, the other, seeing the youths, invites them to approach her, and to encourage them, shows them a hundred rings received from former gallants, notwithstanding her husband's precautions, who keeps her locked up in a chest at the bottom of the lake. The youths reject her advances; she wakes the genie who is going to put them to death, but the rings are produced in evidence against the unfaithful wife, and she is cast away with the loss of her nose.

Books 11 to 13
The eleventh book (Vela) is one huge story, that of Vela, a damsel married to a merchant's son focusing on their shipwreck, separation and re-union.
The twelfth book (Sasankavati) narrates the huge tale of Mrigankadatta, prince of Ayodhya. The narrative is similar to Daṇḍin's Dashakumaracharita, the Tale of the Ten Princes, in which a prince and his nine companions are separated for a season, and recount what has happened to each when they meet again. The exact stories, however, are different. This book also contains an earlier version of a popular collection of tales called the Vetala Panchavimshati: twenty-five tales of a Vetala being related to Trivikramasena, king of Pratishthan, on the Godavari.
The thirteenth book (Madiravati) is short and recounts the adventures of two young Brahmans, who have secret marriages with a princess and her friend. The incidents are curious and diverting and similar to the contrivances by which Madhava and Makaranda obtain their mistresses in the drama entitled Malatimadhava by Bhavabhuti.

Book 14 and 15
The two next books, the fourteenth (Panca) and fifteenth (Mahabhisheka), the scene of action is the fabulous region of the Vidyadharas. In the first, the prince Naravahanadatta, realises that his queen Madanamanchuka was abducted by Manasavega the Vidyadhara , marries additional five women of Vidhyadhara (Vidhyadhari) and finally kills Manasavega to regain his queen.
In Mahabhisheka, Naravahanadatta is crowned emperor of the Vidyadhara people.

Book 16
In (Suratamanjari), the sixteenth book, Udayana, resigns his throne to Gopalaka, the brother of his wife Vasavadatta, and, accompanied by his wives and ministers, goes to Mount Kalanjana. A heavenly chariot descends, and conveys them all to heaven. Gopalaka, inconsolable for the loss of his brother-in-law, soon relinquishes his regal state of Kosambi to his younger brother, Palaka, retires to the White Mountain, and spends the rest of his days in the hermitage of Kashyapa. We have then an account of the son of Palaka falling in love with a young girl of low caste, a Chandali, and different stories illustrative of odd couples. Palaka's ministers argue that the very circumstance of the prince's being enamoured of the Chandali is a proof that she must be a princess or goddess in disguise; otherwise it were impossible that she should have attracted the affections of any noble individual. They therefore counsel the king to demand her hand from Matanga, her father . Matanga consents on condition that the Brahmins of Ujjain eat in his house. Palaka issues orders that eighteen thousand Brahmins, shall dine with the Chandala. The Brahmins are in great alarm, as this is a degradation and loss of caste, and they pray to Mahakala, the form of Siva especially worshipped in Ujjain, to know what to do. He commands them in a dream to comply, as Matanga is in truth a Vidyadhara. He had conspired against the life of Naravahanadatta, in order to prevent his becoming emperor of the Vidyadharas, and had been therefore condemned by Siva to live in Ujjain with his family as Chandalas. The curse was to terminate when eighteen thousand Brahmins should eat in his house; and this being accomplished, Matanga is restored to his rank, and his daughter is judged a fit bride for the son of the king.

Books 17 and 18
The two last books are composed of narratives told by Naravahanadatta, when on a visit to his uncle Gopalaka at the hermitage of Kashyapa. He repeats those stories which were communicated to him when he was separated from Madanamanchuka, to console him under the anguish of separation. (Padmavati) is the love story of Muktaphalaketu, a prince of the Vidyadharas, and Padmavati, daughter of the king of the Gandharvas. The former is condemned by a holy person to become a man, and he is thus for a season separated from the latter. He is, after a short time, restored to his station and his wife.
The last book (Visamasila) has Vikramaditya or Vikramasila, son of Mahendraditya, king of Ujjain, for its hero, and describes his victories over hostile princes, and his acquirement of various princesses. These are interspersed with love adventures, some of which reiterate the calumnies against women, and with stories relating the tricks of professed cheats.

Historiography: versions and translations
Sanskrit antecedents: Bṛhatkathāmañjarī and Bṛhatkathāślokasaṃgraha
Bṛhatkathāmañjarī
Somadeva tells us that the Kathāsaritsāgara is not his original work, but is taken from a much larger collection by Guṇāḍhya, known as the Bṛhatkathā. Kṣemendra, the Sanskrit aesthete from Kashmir, had written his Bṛhatkathāmañjarī, a summary of the Bṛhatkathā twenty or thirty years previously. The Kathāsaritsāgara and the Bṛhatkathāmañjarī agree in the number and the titles of the different lambhakas but, after lambhaka 5, disagree in the order of them. However, all the books of the same name in both versions overlap with each other exactly (excluding a few minor details), except for two. Book 8 (Vela) in Kṣemendra is a combination of Book 11 (Vela) and the beginning of Book 14 (Panca) in Kathāsaritsāgara. Considering that Kṣemendra composed two near faithful extracts of the celebrated epics: the Bharatamanjari and the Ramayanamanjari, it is more probable that it was Kṣemendra, and not Somadeva, who drew up the faithful reproduction of the old Paisaci poem. Kathāsaritsāgara is considered to have better charm of language, elegance of style, masterly arrangement and metrical skill. Also, Kṣemendra’s collection is a third the length of the Kathāsaritsāgara, the printed text amounting to a little more than 7,561 slokas.
In 1871 Professor Bühler (Indian Antiquary, p. 302 et seq.) proved two important facts: firstly, that Somadeva and Kṣemendra used the same text, and secondly, that they worked entirely independently from one another. A Bṛhatkathā such as the two writers reproduced, a prose work in the Paiśācī dialect, existed, therefore, in Kashmir. But it was no longer the book which Guṇāḍhya had composed. It was a huge compilation, incorporating not only many particular stories from heterogeneous sources, but even whole books such as the Pañcatantra, the Vetālapañcaviṃśati and the story of Nala. The charge of abridging, obscuring and dislocating the main narrative is valid, not against Somadeva and Kṣemendra, but against predecessors, whose work of amplification had been completed, so far as completion can be predicated, perhaps two or three centuries earlier.

Bṛhatkathāślokasaṃgraha
Apart from the Kashmir redactions there exists a Sanskrit version of Guṇāḍhya’s work, bearing the title Bṛhatkathāślokasaṃgraha, i.e. the “Great Tale: Verse Epitome.” Only about six of the twenty-six lābhas are currently available. Its discoverer and editor, M. Félix Lacôte, had published (Essai sur Guṇāḍhya et la Bṛhatkathā, Paris, 1908) along with the text an elaborate discussion of all the questions of higher criticism relating to the Kathāsaritsāgara and the other recensions. M. Lacôte’s conclusions, which are developed with great perspicacity, may be summarised as follows. The manuscript came from Nepal, the work of a Nepalese writer, by name Budhasvāmin. It is dated to the eighth to the ninth century CE and is based upon the Paiśāci original. It lacks many of the subsidiary tales in the Kathāsaritsāgara, and thus the main narrative stands out concerned predominantly with the actual adventures of Naravāhanadatta, a hero of Guṇāḍhya’s own invention.

Persian adaptations: Bahr al-asmar and Darya-yi asmar
Kathāsaritsāgara was translated into Persian in Kashmir during the reign of Zayn al-‘Abidin (r. 1418/20-1470) under the name of Bahr al-asmar (“Ocean of Stories”). Nowadays this version is not extant; it is known solely through the evidence from other sources. A likely reference to it can be found in the Rajatarangini by Śrīvara (fl. 1459-1505). Śrīvara, the poet laureate at the court, refers to the commissioning of the translation of Sanskrit works into Persian and vice versa by his patron Zayn al-‘Abidin, among them a translation of “a digest of the Bṛhatkathā” (bṛhatkathāsāra) which may refer to the Kathāsaritsāgara.
Another Persian version was commissioned in the second half of the 16th century during Akbar's reign and accomplished by a certain Mustafa Khaliqdad ‘Abbasi also known as the translator of other works. This work was presumably carried out after 1590 following the military annexation of Kashmir. Abbasi named it Darya-yi asmar (“River of Stories”) to distinguish it from the Kashmirian translation. In its preface, ʿAbbasi mentions that he was assigned to rewrite an earlier version “of the book barhatkata […] which the Kashmirian Brahmin Sumdevbat […] had shortened” and which “someone had undertaken during Zayn al-‘Abidin’s reign”, being fraught with Arabic expressions, in a more readable style.” In conformity with the Sanskrit text, the Persian adaptation is likewise divided into eighteen main chapters, called nahr (rivers), each subdivided into several mauj (waves). This translation was discovered around 1968-9 (National Museum, New Delhi no. 62.1005). It was edited by Dr. Tara Chand and Prof. Syed Amir Hasan Abidi. It is worth mentioning that today only two manuscripts of the Persian version are available; both are incomplete and contain only 8 out of the original 18 chapters of the Sanskrit version each, which Chand and ‘Abidi based their edition upon.
In contrast to other examples from similar kind of literature like Abu al-Maʿali Nasrullah Munshi’s Kalila va Dimna, the Darya-yi asmar was retold not in artificial prose (nasr-i musajja‘) aimed at connoisseurs but rather in simple prose with features that remind of an oral recital. In the Persian narrative we encounter a mix of adaptation techniques: some sections display a transfer close to the Indian version, whereas most parts indicate a more narrative approach. This means that special attention was given to the transmission of the narrated story and not to the preservation of as many textual features as possible. One of the adaptation techniques applied in the Kathāsaritsāgara is the use of explanations and glosses to single words that refer to persons, objects or concepts. The translator-compiler ‘Abbāsī remarks, for example, that “this story is elaborated upon in [other] Indian books”, or comments on certain passages by adding: “[…] according to the sayings of the people of India […].” The second type of strategy encountered is that of inserting poetic quotations from the pool of Persian poetry such as Gulistan, Divan-i Hafiz, Divan-i Salman-i Savaji, Manzumat-i Sharaf al-Din Yazdi, Nizami's Khusrau-u-Shirin, Makhzan al-Asrar, Haft paykar, and various others.

Printed editions and modern translations
Professor H. H. Wilson was the first European scholar who drew the attention of the Western world to this storehouse of fables. In 1824, he gave a summary of the first five books in the Oriental Quarterly Magazine. The first edition of the work was undertaken by Professor Brockhaus. In 1839 he issued the first five chapters only, and it was not till 1862 that the remaining thirteen appeared. Both publications formed part of the Abhandlungen der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft.
It was this text which C. H. Tawney used for his excellent translation (Ocean of the River of Streams) published by the Asiatic Society of Bengal in the Bibliotheca Indica, 1880-1884 (the index not appearing till 1887). Brockhaus’ edition was based primarily on six MSS., though in the second part of the work he apparently had not so many at his disposal. Tawney was not satisfied with several of Brockhaus’ readings, and consequently made numerous fresh renderings or suggestions largely taken from MSS. borrowed from the Calcutta College and from three India Office MSS. lent him by Dr Rost.
In 1889 Durgāprasād issued the Bombay edition, printed at the Nirṇayasāgara Press, which was produced from Brockhaus’ edition and two Bombay MSS. This is the latest text now available.
In 1919, N. M. Penzer first approached Tawney with the suggestion of reissuing his Ocean of the River of Streams. But he revised and published Tawney’s 2 volumes in 10 volumes in 1924. The first volume gave an introduction of Hindu fiction and the other famous story-collections like Panchatantra, Hitopadesha etc. Volumes 2 to 10 published the original translation with extensive comments. Penzer invited different scholars to write forewords to each volume resulting in nine excellent essays dealing with all aspects of the great collection.
A project to translate the full work into modern English prose, translated by Sir James Mallinson, began to appear in 2007 from the Clay Sanskrit Library, published by New York University Press. The translation was based on the Nirnaya Press’s 1915 edition of the Sanskrit text, the edition favored by Sanskritists today. Currently available are 2 volumes of the projected 7-volume edition.

Influence
The stories and their order in Tantrakhyayika within Book 10 are consistent with the tales and arrangement of the Kalila wa Demna more than even the Panchatantra, and it would appear therefore that we have in the Kathasaritsagara an earlier representative of the original collection than even the Panchatantra, at least as it is now met with.
The book was a favourite of scholar of Buddhism Herbert V. Guenther, according to Jodi Reneé Lang, Ph.D.
The idea of a sea of stories was an inspiration for Salman Rushdie's Haroun and the Sea of Stories.

His name is extant in both Southern Buddhism and Northern Buddhism. In Chinese he is known as 歌利王 (Gēlì wáng), sometimes rendered 迦蓝浮王 (Jiālánfú wáng) or 卡拉補王 (Kǎlābǔ wáng).

Jataka tales
King Kalābu appears in the Kṣāntivādi Jātaka (Sanskrit; Pali: Khantivādī Jātaka). The Sanskrit word kṣānti (Pali: khanti) means ""tolerance"" while vādi is a modified form of the word vāda which means ""teaching"" or ""view"".
The name ""Kṣāntivādin"" or ""Kṣāntivāda"" describes the protagonist of the story: an ascetic who excelled at tolerance in face of the brutal atrocities inflicted upon him by King Kalābu. The Pali version of the tale reveals that King Kalābu was a past birth of Devadatta, the enemy of the Buddha, and that Kṣāntivādin was the Buddha himself in that life.

Narrative
The story runs as follows:

King Kalābu was ruling the kingdom of Varanasi (modern Benares). One day he set off for sport and recreation with his harem. After playing, the king fell asleep on the lap of one of his concubines. The other members of the harem went off to enjoy the scenery of the garden.
While they were roaming around, they came upon an ascetic meditating under a tree. They approached him and initiated conversation. He preached the Dhamma (law of morality) for them and the audience became immersed in his talk, forgetting about the king. Meanwhile, the king woke up and proceeded to ask his concubine where the other women-folk were. She answered that they were listening to the teachings of an ascetic. The king flew into a rage and departed to look for the ascetic. When he saw that all the women were entranced by the ascetic's sermon, he could not quell his anger. He questioned the ascetic:
""What are you teaching?"", asked the king.
The ascetic replied, ""I am teaching tolerance.""
""What is tolerance?""
""The ability to stay unmoved in the face of atrocities either physical or verbal by others inflicted on oneself.""
""Then prove it.""
The king ordered his executioner to whip the ascetic. The ascetic was whipped terribly but he did not get angry.
Seeing this, the king asked, ""Are you still tolerant?""
The ascetic calmly replied, ""Yes, your Majesty.""
Then the king ordered his executioner to cut off his various bodily parts. The ascetic bled profusely.
The king finally asked, ""Do you still have tolerance?""
The ascetic calmly responded, ""Your Majesty, tolerance is not in my bodily parts but it is in my heart. Though you can harm my body, my mind is immovable.""
The king had no limit to his anger. He himself stomped on the ascetic's chest, forcing blood to gush from his mouth. Yet, the ascetic remained unmoved. The king's general, who had invited the ascetic to come to the city, came to know about this pathetic situation and ran to the scene.
Seeing the ascetic in this terrible state, he applied some ointment and begged him not to curse the kingdom. The ascetic claimed that he had no ill-will towards the king, but that instead he wished that the king would live for a long time.
This is the story of the past as told by the Buddha. At the end the Buddha declared that this was his perfection of tolerance.

Moral: Tolerance in this life
Once we examine the attitude the Buddha held about the criticism brought against him, his teaching, and community by some of his contemporaries; the perfection of tolerance he carried throughout his many lives of spiritual practice can be better understood. A similar rhetoric used with King Kalābu was applied when the Buddha came to know that Suppiya, an ascetic outside the Buddhist Sangha, criticized the Buddha. Here, the Buddha's admonition reminds us of his previous perfection of tolerance. The discourse from the Brahmajāla Sutta reports the Buddha's words as follows:
""If, bhikkhus, others speak in dispraise of me, or in dispraise of the Dhamma, or in dispraise of the Sangha, you should not give way to resentment, displeasure, or animosity against them in your heart. For if you were to become angry or upset in such a situation, you would only be creating an obstacle for yourselves. If you were to become angry or upset when others speak in dispraise of us, would you be able to recognize whether their statements are rightly or wrongly spoken?""

Mahayana literature
An alternate version of the Jātaka appears in the Mahāvastu.
In the Diamond Sutra, the Buddha refers to King Kalābu and the sage of forbearance as follows:
""Subhūti, the Pāramitā of Forbearance that the Tathāgata speaks of is not a pāramitā of forbearance. Why? Subhūti, this is like in the past when my body was cut apart by the Kalirāja: there were no notions of a self, notions of a person, notions of a being, or notions of a life. In the past, when I was being hacked limb from limb, if there were notions of a self, notions of a person, notions of a being, or notions of a life, then I would have responded with hatred and anger. Remember also that I was the Ṛṣi of Forbearance for five hundred lifetimes in the past. Over so many lifetimes there were no notions of a self, notions of a person, notions of a being, or notions of a life.""

Summary
The king wanders the streets at night to listen to his subjects' opinion of him, and stops by a house where three sisters are talking to one another: the first wanting to marry the feeder of the king's horses, the second to the royal cook, and the third to the king himself. The king brings them all to his presence the next day and marries the youngest.
Time passes, and the young queen is ready to give birth, but asks to be nursed by her elder sisters, instead of stranger. Unbeknownst to her, her sisters have begun to nurture envy at their cadette's fortunate marriage, and seize the opportunity to bring harm to her. The first time, the queen gives birth to a young boy, whom the elder sister replaced with a cur and throw him in the river in an earthen pot. The second time, the queen gives birth to another boy, who is replaced by a kitten, and in the following year, a girl is born, but a doll is put in her place. Thinking his wife is an evil woman, the king banishes her from the palace to sit astride a donkey.
As for the children, the two siblings share the fate of their elder, and are abandoned in the river in a earthen pot. However, each time a Brahmin, who was making his devotions near the river, finds each pot and rescues them, then raises them as their own. The Brahmin names the boys Arun and Barun (Varun) and the girl Kirunmala. After he dies, the siblings meet the king after a heavy storm on the road, and decide to build a palace. One day, a fakir passes by their palace, compliments their fine abode, but suggests the girl to send her brothers for ""a silver tree with flowers of gold, a tree of diamonds with birds of gold perched on it; and a canopy of a net made of pearls"". In this tale, the water is only used to disenchant Kirunmala's petrified brothers, and one of the birds of gold convinces them to invite the king to a banquet.

Analysis
Tale type
The tale is classified in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as ATU 707, ""The Three Golden Children"".
According to Stith Thompson' and Jonas Balys's index of Indian tales, the tale type ATU 707 shows 44 variants across Indian sources. In addition, researcher Noriko Mayeda and Indologist W. Norman Brown divided Indian variants of type 707 in five groups: (1) quest for wonderful items; (2) reincarnation into flowers; (3) use of wooden horses; (4) children sing a song; (5) miscellaneous.

Motifs
According to Giuseppe Flora, Kiran means 'ray, beam (of light)'. As for her brothers' names, Arun derives from Aruṇa, a Hindu deity associated with the sunrise and whose name means 'the reddish one'. Also, in the original, the silver tree is called rūpār gācha, the diamond tree is hīrār gācha, and the bird of gold is sonār pākhī.

Variants
Author Alice Elizabeth Dracott collected a tale from Simla with the title The Enchanted Bird, Music and Stream. In this tale, a prince likes to disguise himself as a poor man and mingle with his subjects. One day, while walking through a gulley, he overhears three sisters talking: the elder wants to marry a prince's servant, the middle one the prince's cook, and the youngest the prince himself. The next day, the prince sends for the three sisters and fulfills their marriage wishes. Some time later, the youngest sister, now the prince's wife, gives birth to a son. The elder sister, jealous of their cadette's fortunate marriage, replace the boy for a puppy and throw him in the stream in a box. The prince's gardener finds the boy and raises him as his own son. In the following years, the princess gives birth to two other children (a boy that is replaced by a kitten and a girl that is replaced by a rat), who are also cast in the river, but are saved by the gardener. The Prince, enraged at his wife, banishes her from the palace. As for the siblings, the gardener asks the Prince for a portion of land to live, and takes the children with him: the boys go hunting while the girl stays home. One day, an old woman pays the siblings' a visit, and says their house lacks a bird, music, and a stream of water. The girl tells her older brothers she wants the three things and they go on a quest for them. The elder brother fails in his quest and is turned to stone, and so does the middle brother. The girl ventures alone up a mountain and captures a talking bird in a cage. The bird then tells her to break a branch of a nearby tree and plant it on the ground, since it will produce music when the breeze blows through it; and to take some water from a stream. She also sprinkles the water on some stone and restores her brothers to life. At the end of the tale, the three siblings invite the Prince to their house and prepare a meal of kheer with a dish of pearls. The Prince remarks he cannot eat the pearls, and the bird replies to him that he believed his wife, the princess, gave birth to animals.
Indian author M. N. Venkataswami published an Indian tale titled The Two Princes and Their Sister: a poor woman has three daughters. One day, a fairy, under the guise of an old woman, is welcomed by the youngest and kind third sister into their house. The fairy blesses their house and leaves. One night, the three sister talk to one another: the eldest promises she can weave a great sail for a vessel, if she maries a captain; the middle one promises to give birth to a boy if she marries a king; and the youngest promises to give birth to twins, a boy with a golden chain on his neck and a girl with two stars on the front if she marries a prince. Coincidentally, a ship's captain, a king and a prince just happen to pass by the house at the exact moment and overhear their conversation. The men take each of the sisters as their respective wives. Jealous of the luck of the younger ones, the eldest sister deceives her brothers-in-law by replacing the king's son for a block and the prince's children for animals, and casting the babies in the water. The babies are saved by a country merchant and looked after by the fairy that visited their biological mothers years ago. When they are grown up, their aunt, the ship's captain's wife, sends them after the dancing-water, the singing apple and the singing bird that sings songs from ""all climes and nationalities"". According to Venkataswami's preface, the tale was provided by a Tamil herbalist named R. J. Samuel, who heard it from a Tamil pandit in the early 1870s.
Noriko Mayeda and W. Norman Brown collected a tale from Jammu from an informant named Des Raj Chopra. In this tale, titled The Slandered Queen, Khalifa Haroun-al-Rashid wanders the city streets at night and spies on three sisters talking: the elder wants to marry the king's cook; the middle one the king's butler; and the youngest the king himself, and bear him two sons and a daughter ""of beautiful complexion"". The king takes them to his court the next morning, and fulfills their marriage wishes. Jealous of their sister's good fortune, the queen's sisters replace the royal children (two golden-haired boys and a girl, born in consecutive years) for animals and throw them in the water. The children are saved by the king's gardener, and, years later, they are sent for a talking bird that knows the future, the golden coloured water and a tree that produces melodies when wind rustles its leaves.
In another tale from Jammu, also collected by Mayeda and Brown as a variant of The Slandered Queen, a king has three wives, and no son yet. One day, the oldest co-wife announces she is pregnant, to the jealousy of the other two, who conspire to take the child and son as they are born and cast them in the water. The child's two brothers, bron in the next years, are also cast in the water. All three are saved by a man who was fishing, and are raised by a wise man. Years later, they live a comfortable house with a beautiful garden. One day, the king passes by their garden and compliments it, but says it lacks the golden water and the celestial bird. The two brothers go on a quest for these two items, but fail and are turned into marble statues; their sister finishes the quest, saves them, and brings the objects home.
Mayeda and Brown summarized a tale collected by Jit Kour: a king has seven wives and no son yet. He decides to travel around until he stops by a house where maidens are talking among themselves, and the most beautiful of them states an astrologer predicted her future: she is to bear ""two handsome boys"" and ""a lovely daughter"". The king takes her as his eighth wife, to the chagrin of the other seven wives, who conspire to degrade her: as soon as the children are born (in three consecutive pregnancies), the queens take the children and cast them in the river, replacing them for monkeys. The children are saved and raised by a fisherman. Years later, an old woman visits the siblings' house and tells them to seek a sparrow that can talk. The brothers fail, but their sister takes the bird and sprinkles holy water to restore them to life. The sparrow then reveals the truth to the king during a banquet.

Adaptations
The 1979 Indian Bengali-language film Arun Barun O Kiranmala was also based on this folktale.

Anthology of Tales Old and New), also known as the Konjaku Monogatari (今昔物語), is a Japanese collection of over one thousand tales written during the late Heian period (794–1185). The entire collection was originally contained in 31 volumes, of which 28 remain today. The volumes cover various tales from India, China and Japan. Detailed evidence of lost monogatari exist in the form of literary critique, which can be studied to reconstruct the objects of their critique to some extent.

Title
Each tale in the Konjaku Monogatarishū starts with the phrase once upon a time (今は昔) (lit. now long ago), which in its Japanese reading is pronounced ima wa mukashi. The Sino-Japanese reading of this phrase is konjaku, and it is from the Chinese-style reading that the collection is named. The Konjaku Monogatarishū is commonly known by the shorter name ""Konjaku Monogatari"". Since it is an anthology rather than a single tale, however, the longer title is more accurate.

Structure
The Konjaku Monogatarishū is divided according to the region of the text. The first five volumes, the 天竺 (Tenjiku) section, contain tales set in India. The next five volumes, the 震旦 (Shintan) section, contain tales set in China. The remainder of the anthology, the 本朝 (Honchō) section, contains tales from Japan.
It is important to note that the arrangement of the stories is in parallel to how Buddhism travelled to Japan. The collection emphasizes the path that Buddhism took to Japan in order to further understand what Buddhism means to Japan. First, Buddhism leaves India and becomes very popular in China. As many things have been borrowed from the Chinese, Buddhism then travels to Japan. Each move leads to a morphing of the basics of this religion so by that time it arrived in Japan, it became a new form of Buddhism for the Japanese.

Contents
The subject-matter is largely drawn from Buddhist and popular folklore. The anthology contains no mythology, and references to Shinto-related themes are notably few. The Buddhist tales cover a wide range of topics; both historical tales about the development, transmission and spread of Buddhism along with dogmatic tales which emphasize karmic retribution. The folkloric tales mostly depict encounters between human beings and the supernatural. The typical characters are drawn from Japanese society of the time — nobility, warriors, monks, scholars, doctors, peasant farmers, fishermen, merchants, prostitutes, bandits, beggars, widows. Their supernatural counterparts are oni and tengu.

Date and authorship
The work is anonymous. Several theories of authorship have been put forward: one argues that the compiler was Minamoto no Takakuni, author of Uji Dainagon Monogatari; another suggests the Buddhist monk Tobane Sōjō, and a third one proposes a Buddhist monk living somewhere in the vicinity of Kyoto or Nara during the late Heian period. So far no substantive evidence has emerged to decide the question and no general consensus has formed.
The date of the work is also uncertain. From the events depicted in some of the tales it seems likely that it was written down at some point during the early half of the 12th century, after the year 1120.

Suzuka Manuscript
The oldest extant copy of the Konjaku Monogatarishū is the Suzuka Manuscript (鈴鹿家旧蔵本). Designated as a National Treasure in 1996, it was assembled by a Shinto priest named Tsuretane Suzuka in the Kamakura period (1185–1333). The manuscript was then brought to Kyoto University by a descendant who was a librarian at the university for donation and archiving. The manuscript has been scanned and made available in digital format on the internet.

Animals in Konjaku Monogatarishū
In this work, specific human traits and characteristics such as the ability to think, feel and speak in a human form of cognition are assigned to various types of animals. By assigning human traits to the animals and through the utilization of these anthropomorphic animals, the authorship was more effectively able to communicate the various motifs, which impart a variety of moral teachings. To be able to implement such a paradigm, the authorship would have utilized pre-conceived common traits which were attributable to specific animals. The animals and their respective traits would have been common and implicit knowledge in ancient Japan and therefore known ubiquitously. The types of tales in Konjaku which include the use of anthropomorphic animals can be broadly classified into categories, in which a particular moral is accentuated.

Significance
Many of the tales which appear in the Konjaku are also found in other collections, such as ghost story collections. All these tales, having passed into the common consciousness, have been retold many times over the succeeding centuries. Modern writers have adapted tales from the Konjaku Monogatarishū: a famous example is Akutagawa Ryūnosuke's In a Grove (well known in the West from Kurosawa's film Rashomon). Other authors who have written stories based on tales from the Konjaku include Jun'ichirō Tanizaki and Hori Tatsuo.
The setsuwa (""spoken story"") in Konjaku Monogatari Shū has two main purposes: religious and secular. The religious aspect is important in leading the reader into a deeper understanding of Buddhism and what it means to the Japanese people. These stories try to appeal to average people of the time by presenting Buddhism in a simple yet meaningful way, one that people from any background can understand. In these tales both the reward for faith and the punishment for sin will be immediate. The secular aspect of these tales is that they can entertain an audience as well as provide enjoyment for an individual reader.
A cryptic line in Akutagawa's classic short story ""Rashōmon"" says 「旧記の記者の語を借りれば、『頭身の毛も太る』ように感じたのである。」 (To borrow a phrase from the writers of the chronicles of old, he felt as if 'even the hairs on his head and body had grown thick'.) This is a reference to a line from the Konjaku Monogatarishū, the last part figuratively meaning that he was scared; he felt as if his hair was standing on end.

There are similar story types of both eastern and western origin in which two disputants lose the object of their dispute to a third.

Western versions and variants
There are ancient Greek versions of the fable, and it was included in the Medici Manuscript collection of Aesop's fables dating from the 1470s. However, its earliest appearance in another language is as number 60 in the collection of 150 fables in Latin verse by the Austrian poet Pantaleon Candidus (1604). Here, a lion and a bear simultaneously attack a fawn and fight over it until they collapse from fatigue. Then a fox that has been watching them snatches their prey and makes off with it. The moral Pantaleon draws at the end is Saepe alter alterius fruitur labribus (from the labours of others it is often another who profits). The story seems to have entered printed collections of Aesop's fables from this source. In his 1692 retelling, Sir Roger L'Estrange anglicizes the conclusion as 'Tis the Fate of all Gotham Quarrels, when Fools go together by the Ears, to have Knaves run away with the Stakes'.
Earlier European versions of this type of story feature two other animals fighting over a find or their prey, only to have a third come and steal it. One of the earliest in English is referred to briefly in Geoffrey Chaucer's The Knight's Tale (1490):

We strive as did the two hounds for the bone,
They fought all day, and yet their part was none;
There came a kite by, while that they were wrath,
And bore away the bone between them both.    (CT 1177–80)
The situation was proverbial and expressed alternatively in English as ""While two dogs are fighting for a bone, a third runs away with it"". Its Dutch equivalent, Als twee honden vechten om een been, loopt de derde om mee heen, was among those illustrated in Pieter Bruegel the Elder's Netherlandish Proverbs (1559).

La Fontaine's Fables transformed the story into Les voleurs et l'âne (I.13). There two thieves fight over the question of whether to keep or sell a stolen donkey, only to have another thief ride it off while they are doing so. La Fontaine draws a political moral, likening the dispute to a contemporary war between Hungary and Turkey over the province of Transylvania. In the Walloon dialect imitation made by François Bailleux in 1851, Lès voleûrs èt l'ågne, that author likens the dispute between the thieves to two lovers fighting over a girl while a third has his way with her.
Ambrose Bierce also reinterpreted the story in the ""Old Saws with New Teeth"" section of his Fantastic Fables (1899):

Two Thieves, having stolen a Piano and being unable to divide it fairly without a remainder, went to law about it and continued the contest as long as either one could steal a dollar to bribe the judge. When they could give no more an Honest Man came along and by a single small payment obtained a judgment and took the Piano home, where his daughter used it to develop her biceps muscles, becoming a famous pugiliste.
Bierce takes the hint for the conduct of his 'honest man' from Samuel Croxall's Fables of Aesop and others: translated into English with instructive applications (1722 and often reissued). The 'application' for the fable of ""The Lion, the Bear and the Fox"" reflects on the foolishness of applying to lawyers in disputes over property: 'When people go to law about an uncertain title, and have spent their whole estates in the contest, nothing is more common than for some little pettifogging attorney to step in, and secure it to himself.' Thomas Bewick indicates the same moral in his illustrated Select Fables of Aesop (1784). There the preface to Fable 20, titled ""The Lion, the Tyger and the Fox"", warns that 'The intemperate rage of clients gives the lawyer an opportunity of seizing the property in dispute'.

Eastern variations
Just as the story of the dogs who lost everything while fighting over a bone became proverbial in England, the Indian proverbial equivalent is expressed as 'monkey's justice'. The story to which it refers is of two cats who fight over a piece of bread, or butter or cheese, and go before a monkey to adjudicate their shares. He cuts it into two unequal halves and has to nibble first one then the other to get them equal until the cats beg him to stop; claiming it as his fee, the monkey gobbles the remainder and leaves them nothing. A Hungarian folktale with much the same plot concerns two bears quarrelling over the division of a cheese and applying to a fox for adjudication. It was the subject of a Russian animated short in 1954 and an English language retelling in 1998.
The Indian fable involves the same distrust of lawyers as in the West and it is this parallel that is underlined in some European literary retellings. One of the earliest examples appears in Antoine Houdar de la Motte's Nouvelles Fables, an English translation of which followed in 1721. Soon after, Allan Ramsay used it as the basis for his poem in Scots dialect, ""The twa cats and the cheese"". The same story reappears in Alfred de Saint-Quentin's poem in Guyanese creole, Dé Chat ké Makak (The Two Cats and the Monkey) and also makes an early English appearance in Jefferys Taylor's Aesop in Rhyme.
A much earlier Indian variation on the story appears in the Buddhist scriptures as the Dabbhapuppha Jataka. Here a jackal offers to arbitrate between two otters who are quarrelling over the division of a fish they have co-operated in bringing to land. The jackal awards them the head and tail and runs off with the bulk of their catch. The moral drawn is a political one:

Just as when strife arises among men,
They seek an arbiter: he's leader then,
Their wealth decays and the king's coffers gain.
The story has obvious affinities with the fable of the Lion's Share and the similar political moral drawn from it by some commentators. It has been applied particularly to the troubles of India under the English colonial regime and later by Gandhi to the troubles arising from the partition of India in 1947.

Artistic interpretations
The fable of ""The Lion, the Bear and the Fox"" figured as one of a series in the Copeland and Garrett period of late Spode pottery between 1830–79. The designs for these were taken from the illustrations in the 1793 edition of the Rev. Samuel Croxall's Fables of Aesop.
Honoré Daumier made an oil painting of La Fontaine's fable (c. 1858–60) which is on display in the Musée d'Orsay. It is based on a lithograph of street fighters which appeared in Le Charivari on 23 August 1845, the preliminary drawing for which is also in the same museum. The painter emphasises the fight between the thieves in the foreground, standing out against the over-all dark colouring, while in the background, hidden in the shadows, the flight of the third thief on the ass is roughly sketched in. Among other 19th century French artists who have treated the subject are François Chifflart and Paul Cézanne. The former features two thieves fighting in the lower foreground of a wide landscape, with the third galloping towards a path up the distant cliffs. Cézanne's later painting (1879/80) has a group of four thieves struggling in one corner of a dynamic seaside landscape over which loom cliffs and pines; the ass is peaceably wandering downhill towards two seated characters, one of whom is smoking.
The French fable has also been set for choir performance by Georges Moineau (b. 1914).

In English the phrase used in the sense of nearly all only appeared at the end of the 18th century; the French equivalent, le partage du lion, is recorded from the start of that century, following La Fontaine's version of the fable.

The Phaedrus version
The early Latin version of Phaedrus begins with the reflection that ""Partnership with the mighty is never trustworthy"". It then relates how a cow, a goat and a sheep go hunting together with a lion. When it comes to dividing the spoil, the lion says, ""I take the first portion because of my title, since I am addressed as king; the second portion you will assign to me, since I'm your partner; then because I am the stronger, the third will follow me; and an accident will happen to anyone who touches the fourth."" This was listed as Fable 339 in the Perry Index and was later the version followed by William Caxton in his 1484 collection of the Fables.
The number of differing variations circulating by the time of the Middle Ages is witnessed by the fact that Marie de France included two in her 12th century Ysopet. Both appear under the title ""The Lion Goes Hunting"" (De Leone Venante). On one occasion, she recounts, the lion is joined by officers of his court, a wild ox and a wolf, who divide the catch into three and invite their lord to apportion it. Then on another occasion, when the lion is accompanied by a goat and a sheep, the deer they take is divided into four. In both cases the lion begins by claiming portions as a legal right and retains the others with threats. In La Fontaine's Fables there is a fourfold division between a heifer, a goat and a lamb (Fables I.6). Each of these the lion retains because he is king, the strongest, the bravest, and will kill the first who touches the fourth part.
A Latin reference to Aesop's fable is found at the start of the Common Era, where the phrase societas leonina (a leonine company) was used by one Roman lawyer to describe the kind of unequal business partnership described by Aesop. The early 19th century writer Jefferys Taylor also retold the fable in terms of a commercial enterprise in his poem ""The Beasts in Partnership"":

The Babrius version
In the extended Greek telling of Babrius it is a lion and a wild donkey who go hunting together, the first outstanding for strength, the second for speed. The lion divides their take into three, awarding himself the first because he is king of the beasts, the second because they are 'equal' partners, and suggesting that the ass runs away quickly rather than dare to touch the third. The moral Babrius draws is, ""Measure yourself! Do not engage in any business or partnership with a man more powerful!""
Another version that first appeared in the Middle Ages is more cynical still. A fox joins the lion and donkey in hunting. When the donkey divides their catch into three equal portions, the angry lion kills the donkey and eats him. The fox then puts everything into one pile, leaving just a tiny bit for herself, and tells the lion to choose. When the lion asks her how she learned to share things this way, the fox replies, ""From the donkey's misfortune."" This variation is given a separate number (149) in the Perry Index and is the one followed by such Neo-Latin writers as Gabriele Faerno and Hieronymus Osius and in English by Geoffrey Whitney.
This alternative fable was given a different reading by the 13th century Persian poet Rumi in his Masnavi. He began by orienting the reader to interpret the fable in a spiritual sense:

In Rumi's telling, the lion had a wolf and a fox as hunting companions. The lion ordered the wolf to divide the catch and when it did so into three parts, tore off the wolf's head, just as the lion tore the donkey to pieces in Aesop's fable. Rumi's speciality, however, is always to offer an explanation of his actors' motives. In this case the lion explains that it is an act of grace for him to do so since the wolf did not recognise superiority when he saw it.
When the fox was tested in the same way, he did not even retain a morsel for himself, explaining (as in the Greek version) that he had learned wisdom from the wolf's fate and thanking the lion for giving him the privilege of going second. This allows Rumi to conclude that we are lucky to be living now, with the examples of past generations to guide us. Rumi's fox then worships at the feet of the lion, addressing him with the words ""O king of the world"" and is duly rewarded for this devotion with everything that he had resigned to the divine king.
Much the same interpretation was given to the tale by Rumi's English contemporary, Odo of Cheriton, in the Latin work known as Parabolae. For him too the lion is a symbol of God and his actions are interpreted as an expression of divine justice. Odo explains that the lion punished the wolf, as God did Adam, for the sin of disobedience. The moral of the story is to learn from this example to show reverence to God, just as the fox learned from the wolf's punishment. This reading of the fable therefore gained currency in Western Europe too, both via the preachers who used Odo's book as a source of stories for their sermons and through translations of it into French, Spanish and Welsh.

Other related Eastern fables
There is a close family resemblance between fables where the lion takes all because he can and fables where an arbiter takes advantage of his powerful position, and indeed both are type 51 in the Aarne–Thompson classification system.  The 10th-century Arabic Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity tells one such arbitration fable, said there to be of Indian origin. Here a group of foxes are sharing a dead camel. They cannot decide how to divide it among themselves and persuade a passing wolf to make a just division. At first the wolf begins to do this, but on further consideration he decides to keep the rest for himself, as he is, after all, more powerful. (In this case, however, the foxes appeal to the lion who decides in their favour and kills the wolf and returns the camel to them.)

This fable shades into an Indian variant of the story, first told as the Dabbhapuppha Jataka, which features different animals but has at its centre the same situation of an animal making an unequal division. Here a jackal offers to arbitrate between two otters who are quarrelling over a fish they have co-operated in bringing to land. The jackal awards them the head and tail and runs off with the bulk of their catch. As well as being a condemnation of the greed that leads to strife, the tale takes a sceptical view of how the powerful frame the law to suit themselves, concluding with the satirical verse:

In that the tale deals with outside arbitration, however, it has certain points in common with another of Aesop's fables, The Lion, the Bear and the Fox, in which the first two beasts simultaneously attack a kid and then fight over their spoil. When they are both too exhausted to move, a fox steals their prey and leaves them to reflect, ""How much better it would have been to have shared in a friendly spirit.""

Sufi poet Maulana Daud chose the oral epic of Lorik and Chanda to write ""Chandayan"", the first Hindi Sufi love poem in 1379. He believed that ""Chandayan"" is a divine truth and its shruti are equivalent to the verses of the Quran.

Lorik-Chanda in Chhattisgarh
Lorik-Chanda in Chhattisgarh is a folk dance-drama. It is one of Chhattisgarh's major performance arts. This folk dance in Balod district is particularly popular. Its heroine Chanda is the daughter of King Mahar. The king has wed her to a person who is often ill. Lorik is a 'gwala' from Ahir caste who grazes cows. He is charming, strong and takes pride in his Raut society. Princess Chanda is charmed by Lorik's flute playing skills and falls in love with him.
When Chanda was returning to her husband's home, a man named Bathua tried to assault her.  Lorik saves Chanda in time.  Chanda is captivated by his valor while Lorik is mesmerized by her beauty.  Both of them instantly fall in love and begin to meet regularly. 
One day, Lorik went to the city to buy goods. Princess Chanda devises a plan to have Lorik for herself. All the girls in the market were fawning over Lorik.  Chanda takes the help of an old lady named Malin.  The old lady goes to the market to call Lorik and tells him that his grandfather has brought a new cow and a calf. She tells him that its very upsetting and it will be great if he walked home and saw to it. 
One day, both decide to run away from home.  Enraged by this decision of married lovers, Chanda's husband Veerabavan tries to kill them but fails.  On their way, a snake bites Lorik, but he recovers by the grace of the Gods Mahadev and Parvati. Later on, Lorik wins the battle over the King of Karingha.
Living happily with Chanda, Lorik later receives news that his impoverished first wife Manjari is on the verge of begging and their cows have been lost.  Lorik comes back to his village with Chanda to save his wife and looks for his cows.  His wife's envy leads to a brawl between Manjari and Chanda. Manjari wins but Lorik is saddened to see the devastating outcome of his actions and leaves everything to become a wanderer. 
Lorik Chanda's saga is seen as a magical link to create an analogy between inequality as the protagonist is Yaduvanshi and feeds the cow while the heroine is the king's daughter.  Folk admirer Ram Hriday Tiwari considers this saga to be an unmitigated desire to seek the love of two human beings.  Ramakant Srivastava, a narrator who has done a detailed study on folklore, says that the society does not look at the love affair of a married woman and man with good eyes, but stereotypes appear to be broken in the saga of Lorik-Chanda.  In this, we get acquainted with the mature love of married people.

Author V. A. K. Ayer also translated the compilation as Stories of King Madana Kama, published in 1962.
Dravidologist Kamil Zvelebil provided another English language translation with the title The Story of King Mataṉakāma.

Legacy
Although it was important as a collection of folktales, it did not have much effect on Tamil literary culture. The 1941 film Madanakamarajan was broadly based on this work.

Story
The story runs that the Bodhisattva was born as a monkey, ruler over 80,000 monkeys. They lived at a spot near the Ganges and ate of the fruit of a great mango tree. King Brahmadatta of Benares, desiring to possess the mangoes, surrounded the tree with his soldiers, in order to kill the animals, but the Bodhisattva formed a bridge over the stream with his own body and by this means enabled the whole tribe to escape into safety. 
Devadatta, the jealous and wicked cousin of the Buddha, was in that life one of the monkeys and, thinking it a good chance to destroy his enemy, jumped on the Bodhisattva’s back and broke his spine. 
The king, seeing the good deed of the Bodhisattva and repenting of his own attempt to kill him, tended him with great care when he was dying and afterwards gave him royal obsequies.

Depiction in Bharhut
In this jataka tale the Buddha, in a previous incarnation as a monkey king, self-sacrificingly offers his own body as a bridge by which his fellow monkeys can escape from a human king who is attacking them. A short section of the river, across which the monkeys are escaping, is indicated by fish designs. Directly below that, the impressed humans are holding out a blanket to catch him when he falls. At the very bottom (continuous narrative), the now recovered Buddha-to-be preaches to the king.

Depiction in Sanchi
Down the panel of the relief from Sanchi (Stupa No1, Western Gateway) flows, from top to bottom, the river Ganges. To the left, at the top, is the great mango tree to which 
two monkeys are clinging, while the king of the monkeys is stretched across the river from the mango tree to the opposite bank, and over his body some monkeys have 
already escaped to the rocks and jungles beyond. 
In the lower part of the panel, to the left, is king Brahmadatta on horseback with his soldiers, one of whom with bow and arrow is aiming upwards at the Bodhisattva. Higher up the panel the figure of the king is repeated, sitting beneath the mango tree and conversing with the dying Bodhisattva, who, according to the Jataka story, gave the king good advice on the duties 
of a chief.

On that final day Sunanda, the charioteer, began to dig a hole. The Bodhisattva thought, ""This is my time for an effort to escape"". He lifted the chariot up high while speaking: ""Behold these arms and legs of mine, and hear my voice and what I say; if in this wood you bury me, you will incur great guilt today."" The charioteer set him free. So he went straight to the forest to live as an ascetic.

The ship, having been violently tossed on the seas as it sailed its course, could not survive the damage. Planks gave way, the water rose higher and higher, and the ship began to sink in the middle of the ocean. Although knowing the vessel was doomed, Mahajanaka did not panic.

Seeing Sama taming the wild animals, the King was wondering whether the creature was a god or a Nāga. To find out, he decided to wound and disable him, and then ask. The King shot a poisoned arrow and wounded Sama, who fell to the ground. Sama spoke: ""I have no enmity against anyone. Who has wounded me?"" The King went to Sama and asked him his name. Sama then told the King the story of fostering his blind parents. The King thought to himself, ""I have done evil to such a holy being; how can I comfort him?"" He decided to bring the blind parents to their son. In the meantime the goddess Bahusodari decided to help Sama and his parents. In the end Sama recovered from his wound and both of his parents' sight was restored.

God Sakka sent Matali, the charioteer, to bring Nemi to Sakka's Heaven. On his way, King Nemi chose first to see Hell and later Heaven. When Nimi saw all the suffering in Hell, he was terrified. Later they arrived at Sudhamma Hall— the assembly hall of the 33 gods in Heaven. Nemi discoursed with the gods for seven days but refused to live in this Heaven forever.

Despite Mahosadha's warning, King Vedeha began to plan his journey to Culani's kingdom. Four months in advance of the arrival of King Vedeha, Mahosadha started to build a palace one mile outside the capital Uttara-pancala. This palace had a secret tunnel, which led to the Ganges River and to Culani's palace. When King Vedeha arrived at his new palace, King Culani's troops surrounded it. Reacting to this threat, Mahosadha sent King Vedeha through the tunnel to the Ganges River, and troops to Culani's palace. These troops tricked Culani's family to go through the tunnel to the Ganges River. King Vedeha and Culani's family went by boat to the Kingdom of Mithila. Soon after Culani learned of the disappearance of King Vedeha and his family. When King Culani met Mahosadha, he realized that he could not hurt him, because his family had been taken hostage. But when both men walked through the tunnel, Mahosadha immediately took the sword, which he had hidden the day before. He swung his sword up high and shouted: ""Sire, whose are all the kingdoms of India?"" King Culani replied: ""Yours, wise sir! Spare me!"" Mahosadha said: ""Be not troubled, sire: queen, son and mother all come back, my return is the only condition."" Then Mahosadha handed over his sword to the king.

Nāga Prince Bhūridatta had found an ant hill near the Yamuna river. Every night he folded his body on top of this ant hill.

Alambayana forced him into a basket and went to a certain village. He set the basket down in the middle of the marketplace and ordered the Naga prince to come out. The great snake danced causing great wonder among the villagers. When they went from village to village, they earned a lot of money. Then they reached Benares. Bhuridatta's wife and mother had missed him so very much. They sent his brother Sudassana to search for him. When he arrived in Benares, the people were gathering to watch the snake show.

Prince Canda Kumara served his father, King Ekaraja of Pupphavati as a viceroy. Khandahala, a Brahmin, was the family priest. The King had a high opinion of his wisdom and made him a judge. But he took bribes and dispossessed the real owners and put the wrong owners in possession. The Prince was the Brahmin's natural foe. One day, the King saw the beautiful heaven in his dream. He asked Khandahala the way to this heaven. Khandahala answered: ""It will cost you a lot. You must sacrifice: your sons, queens, merchant princes, bulls, steeds, four pieces of these species, with the proper ritual, this will give you entrance into this heaven."" The King, not being of sound mind, gave the order to prepare for a massive sacrifice outside the city. Canda Kumara asked his father not to go through with this sacrifice, though not to save himself, because he was willing to die but for the sake of the innocent victims. The troops rounded up the doomed. When all the preparations were completed they brought Canda Kumara to the sacrificial pit. At that moment Queen Canda Suriya called upon the gods. God Sakka let lightning destroy the royal parasols. Without these parasols there was no longer a sacred ceremony. Whereupon the angry crowd attacked Khandahala and killed him. King Ekajara was sent into exile and Canda Kumara became the new king.

Angati was king of the Kingdom of Videha. On the eve of the full moon festival, King Angati went to the deer park to meet Guna Kassapa, a naked ascetic. He asked the rules of good behaviour with respect to parents, teachers, wives, children, the elderly, the Brahmins, the army and his people. Guna replied: ""There is no fruit, good or evil, in following the rules of right conduct; there is no other world. All beings are predestined, what then is the use of giving alms."" King Angati, convinced of the truth of Guna's words, decided to make no further effort to do good. Narada, who was the Great Brahma of that time, looked down on the earth. He descended to the earth and spoke: ""I'm Brahma and I'll tell you that you condemn yourself to hell."" Angati replied: ""If there is another world for the dead, then give me here five hundred pieces of gold, and I'll give you a thousand pieces of gold in the next world."" Narada answered: ""Here when a man is a lover of sin, wise men don't entrust a loan to him: there is no return from such a debtor."" Narada described Hell with its endless torments. Angati was trembling with fear. He looked for the Bodhisatta for help and asked him how he could regain his senses. Narada then told him that while he was King and in good health, he was not providing for the poor, the hungry, the aged and the Brahmins. King Angati begged for forgiveness. Narada sped back to the brahma world.

9. Vidhura Panditta (the eloquent sage) - Act of reality (sacca)
(Khmer: ព្រះវិធុរបណ្ឌិត Thai: พระวิธูรบัณฑิต Burmese: ဝိဓူရအမတ်)
King Dhananjaya lived in the city of Indapatta in the Kingdom of Kuru. Vidhura Panditta (the Bodhisatta) who was his sage, had a great eloquence in discoursing on the law. Naga Queen Vimala longed to hear him speaking. She pretended to be ill and only one thing could cure her. She said she desired Vidhura's heart or she will die. Irandati, the beautiful daughter of King Varuna, was sent out to seek a husband, who could bring Vidhura's heart to her. Punnaka, a yak (or demon) heard her love call and decided to marry her. King Varuna said: ""If you bring that sage here then Irandati will be your lawful wife."" Punnaka went to Indapatta to meet King Dhananjaya to play a game of dice. Having manipulated three rounds dicing, Punnaka asked for payment—the sage Vidhura. The King agreed to give him away. Punnaka seized Vidhura with a roar and whirled him round his head. Vidhura undismayed asked: ""What is your reason for killing me."" When Punnaka told him why, the Bodhisatta perceived that a misconception had brought about all this calamity. He said: ""Vimala has no need of Vidhura's heart, but she must have felt a great longing to hear my words."" The Bodhisatta asked to be brought to the Naga kingdom to clear up this misunderstanding.

10. Prince Vessantara (the charitable prince) - Act of generosity (dāna)
(Khmer: ព្រះវេស្សន្តរ Thai: พระเวสสันดร Burmese: ဝေဿန္တရာမင်းကြီး)
Prince Vessantara lived in the capital city of Jetuttara of the Kingdom of Sivi and was devoted to almsgiving, but was never satisfied with giving. He gave Paccaya, the royal white elephant, to the neighboring Kingdom of Kalinga, affected by drought. The people were so angry about it, that King Sanjaya had to send away his son. Before Prince Vessantara and his wife and two children went into exile, he gave away all his possessions. On the road travelling by horse and buggy, he gave them to a Brahmin. So the four went through the jungle on foot to Mount Vamka. Jujaka (Thai: Chuchok) a poor old Brahmin lived in the village of Dunnivittha with Ammittada, a beautiful young woman. Jujaka, prompted by his wife, wanted to look for the whereabouts of Vessantara. After Jujaka had asked for Kanha and Jali, Vessantara's children, they hid in a pond. Vessantara asked the children to come out of the pond and go with Jujaka. God Sakka changed shape and stopped Vessantara who also gave away his wife. While Jujaka was asleep, a god and a goddess, who were changed to the father and mother, took care of the two children. After King Sanjaya had bought back his two grandchildren, they went with Queen Phusati to Mount Vamka. Prince Vessantara returned with his whole family from Mount Vamka. Back in the city of Jetutthara they were warmly welcomed.

She was placed by Cātummahārājika to protect virtuous beings from shipwreck. She appears in several Buddhist stories including the Mahanipata Jataka (Mahajanaka Jataka), in which she rescues Prince Mahajanaka from a shipwreck.

Etymology
In Pali, maṇīmekhalā refers to a girdle or belt of jewels. In Southeast Asia, she is known by various indigenized appellations, including as Mani Maykhala (မဏိမေခလာ) in Burmese, as Moni Mekhala (មណីមេខលា) or Neang Mekhala (នាងមេខលា) in Khmer; as Mani Mekkhala (มณีเมขลา) in Thai.

In Mainland Southeast Asia
Archaeological evidence of Manimekhala in the form of reliefs has been found in Zothoke, Myanmar (near Bilin), dating to the first millennium AD.
Manimekhala is seen in wat paintings across Mainland Southeast Asia depicting scenes from the Mahajanaka. In Thailand and Cambodia, she is considered a goddess of lightning and the seas.

Manimekhala and Ramasura
The story of Manimekhala and Ramasura is mentioned many times in the classical literature of Cambodia and Thailand. It depicts Manimekhala along with Ramasura (usually considered a depiction of Parashurama) and Arjuna. According to legend, the phenomena of lightning and thunder is produced from the flashing of Manimekhala's crystal ball and the sound of Ramasura's axe as he pursues her through the skies.

In Sri Lanka
In Sri Lanka, she is considered to be the sea goddess. In the Tamil epic poem, the Manimekalai, she puts the eponymous heroine to sleep and takes her to the island Maṇipallavam (Nainatheevu). In the mythic cycle of the god Devol, when the latter approaches Sri Lanka and his ship founders, it is Manimekhalai, on the instructions of the god Śakra, who conjures up a stone boat to save him.

Dance
In the classical dance traditions of Thailand and Cambodia, sacred dramatic dances depict the story of Manimekhala and Ramasura.

Cambodia
Robam Moni Mekhala (Khmer: របាំមុនីមេខលា, also known as Robam Mekhala-Reamesor) is a Khmer classical dance that portrays the story of Moni Mekhala and Reamesor. It is part of the buong suong dance suite that is among the most sacred of Khmer classical dances, serving a ceremonial purpose to invoke rain upon the land.

Thailand
In Thailand, the Mekkhala–Ramasun dance was performed as a boek rong ('prelude dance') introduction before main performances of lakhon nai or khon dances.

In modern usage
The popular Burmese pop singer Maykhala derives her stage name from Manimekhala.
Her name was contributed by Thailand for tropical cyclone names occurring as Tropical Storm Mekkhala in 2002, 2008, 2015, and 2020. Also, one award given to the television industry in Thailand since 1980 is called the Mekkhala Award.

Versions of the story are reported in the literature of Southeast Asian countries, and similar stories about a bird maiden and a mortal man can be found in East Asia.

Synopsis
Manohara, the youngest of seven daughters of the Kimnara king, lives on Mount Kailash. One day, she travels to the human realm. She is caught by a hunter (using a magic noose in some versions) who gives her to Prince Sudhana. Son of King Adityavamsa and Queen Chandradevi, Sudhana is a renowned archer and heir to the Panchala kingdom. The prince falls in love with Manohara, and they get married.
Later, when the prince is away in battle, Manohara is accused by the royal counselor of bringing bad luck to the city and is threatened with death. She flies away, back to the Kimnara kingdom. She leaves behind a ring and the directions to reach the Kimnara kingdom so that Prince Sudhana can follow her.
Prince Sudhana returns to Panchala and follows her. From a hermit, he learns the language of animals to locate the Kimnara kingdom, and the necessary prayers to win back the princess. The journey takes seven years, seven months, and seven days. Along the way, Sudhana confronts a Yaksha (ogre), a river of flames, and a gigantic tree. After the long and arduous ordeal, he meets the Kimnara king who asks the prince to prove his sincerity with various tests assessing strength, perseverance, and wit. In the first test, Sudhana is made to lift a stone bench in the garden. The second task tested his skill with the bow and arrow. The final test is to identify which of seven identical women is Manohara, who he recognizes by the ring on her finger. Satisfied, the Kimnara king consents to their marriage and the couple returns to Panchala.

Distribution
This story features in the folklore of Myanmar, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Sri Lanka, northern Malaysia and Indonesia. The tale has also spread to China, Kucha, Khotan, Java, Tibet, and Bengal.
The Pannasjataka, Pali text written by a Buddhist monk/sage in Chiangmai around AD 1450–1470, also told the story of Sudhana and Manohara. There are also many similar versions told in China (where it is known as Chinese: 悅意; pinyin: Yuèyì), Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, including the Chinese story of the Princess and the Cowherd. In these stories, seven women who can fly descended to earth to take a bath, the youngest and prettiest of whom was captured by a human, and subsequently became a wife of a male human (either her captor or the prince-hero of the story). Later in the stories, the heroine put on some magical thing that enabled her to fly or transform into a bird, and flew away; prompting the quest by the hero in pursuit of his flying wife.

Adaptations
Theatre
According to James R. Brandon, the story of Manohara is a popular theme in Southeast Asian theatre.
The tale of Manora was adapted as play in Burma (Myanmar), where the character was known as Manoharī, one of the nine royal daughters that live in a silver mountain, located after ""a belt of prickly cane"", ""a stream of liquid copper"" and a ""Beloo""(Yaksha). Her future husband, Prince Sudhana  Sudhanu (Meaning: Golden Bow) was prince of panchala.  In this version, the princesses fly by the use of an enchanted girdle, and the Manohara-like maiden is captured by a magical slipknot.

Literature
The characters of the tale are also known in Southeast Asia as Kev Monora and Prah Sothon.
The tale was also found in the Sanskrit Buddhist literature of Nepal, with the name Story of Suchandrima and a Kinnarí, where the main couple were named Mahonará and Sudhanusha. In another version from Nepal, Kinnarí Avadána, hunter Utpala captures a Kinnari (unnamed in the tale) with a magical noose. Prince Sudhana of Hastiná arrives with his hunting excursion and falls in love with the Kinnari.
Another translation named the prince as Sudhanu and the kinnari as Manohara, daughter of King Druma.
The tale is also known as Sithon and Manola in Laos.

Legacy
The story of Manohara and Prince Sudhana may have inspired the Manora type of drama dancing, performed in Thailand and Malaysia.

In recognition of his lifelong contribution to folklore collection and research, the Rabindra Bharati University awarded him D.Litt. degree in 1987.

Early life and education
On 31 January 1904 Mansuruddin  was born to Muhammad Jaider Ali (father) and Jiarun Nisa (mother) in the Muraripur village under Sujanagar thana of Pabna district of East Bengal of the British India, now in Bangladesh. His education started in a rural school called Madhabchandra Nandi Pathshala. He matriculated from the Khalilpur High School in 1921. He did ISc from the Pabna Edward College in 1923 and then IA from the Rajshahi College in 1924, both IA and ISc being equivalent to HSC. He obtained his bachelor's degree (BA) from Rajshahi College in 1926. He studied in the department of Indian Vernacular of the Calcutta University, from where he secured an M. A. (Master of Arts) with a First Class in 1928. While a student of the Rajshahi College, he was married to Sharifun Nisa in 1925. They had six sons and six daughters.

Teaching career
In 1929, he joined government service as a school sub-inspector. While posted in Naogaon, he came to meet with Annadashankar Roy, who was then the sub-divisional officer (SDO). His career as a teacher commenced in 1932 when he joined the Dhaka Islamic Intermediate College to teach English language and literature. From 1935 to 1938, he taught at the Howrah Intermediate College, Calcutta. From 1938 to 1941, he taught Bengali language and literature in the Chittagong College.

Also, he served for some time as an instructor at the Police Academy, Sardah. As a teacher he was very interesting and attractive to his pupils.

Literary career
Mansuruddin started to write at a very early stage. Although the collection of folklore remains his greatest legacy, he wrote literary essays and fiction all through his life. His most notable literary contribution is, however, the collection of over six thousand folk songs from different rural areas of Bengal. In 1952, he worked as editor of monthly literary Mah-e Now for about six months (on deputation from government service).
He spent fifty to sixty years collecting Baul songs and other rural songs. He transcribed without caring for lexical accuracy. He took down as he heard from the mouth of the singers. He collected a huge number of folklore poems and songs, many of which were collected in thirteen volumes during his lifetime. He also collected songs of Lalon Fakir and wrote on him. Also, in 1974, he translated some songs of Lalon Fakir for the international audience. He often encouraged younger folklorists to research following internationally recognised scientific conventions. At the same time, he advised folklore researchers to travel to the rural sources of the folklore items to discover the life behind it.

Important works
Apart from Haramoni ('হারামণি'), his notable collection was Lalon Fakir-er Gaan ('লালন ফকিরের গান' : Songs of Lalan Fakir), published in 1948. Lalan Geetika ('লালন গীতিকা') was published subsequently. Folksongs of Lalan Shah in English rendering was published in 1974. Introductions to different volumes of Haramoni are revealing and educative. In the Introduction of Volume V of Haramoni, he wrote, ""No contemporary poet was to be compared with Lalon. The song of Lalon Shah bears the quaking of life and delightful reason why the rural indigent people preserve it. This song quenches the spiritual musical thirst, in fact, though Lalon is illiterate but his songs are full of refulgent. The language of Shah is more glorious than Dasharoti Ray, Modhu Kanan even than the language of Ram Prasad-No other his contemporary Muslim poet can be compared with him, even the poem of great litterateur Meer Mosharraf Hossain is worse than that of Lalon"". A collection of Vaishnab Kabita was published in 1942. He wrote two novels, which were First July ('পহেলা জুলাই') (1932) and  Satashey March ('সাতাশে মার্চ') (1958). He produced three volumes of folktales, namely, Shirni (1932), Agar baati (1935) and Shiropa (1938). He published a translation of Aurangzeb in 1940. His essays were published in several volumes. These included Dhaner Manjari (1933) and Kabya Samput (1948). His notable work, Muslim Contribution in Bengali Literature, was published in 3 volumes between 1960 and 1981. Other prose works are Conflict between the Hindus and the Mussalmans  (1981) and  Vaishnab Kabita by Muslim composers (1942). Muhammad Monsooruddin, another prominent folklorist of Bangladesh, took up the task of collecting Baul songs, which had been started by Tagore. After the publication of the first volume (1939) with preface from Tagore, in 1942, Calcutta University published his second volume of Hara-Mani (Lost Gems), which included a few hundred songs. Since then, 12 additional volumes of his collections have been published in Dacca. Jassim Uddin, who started his career as a collections of folksongs and folktales. He was, however, most famous for his use of folklore themes in dramas and in poetry. His published folksong collections include Rangila Nayer Majhi (The Boatman of the Green Boat) in 1938. His collection of humorous folktales, published in Bengali as Bangalir Hashir Galpa (1960) appeared along with English translation. He also published Jarigan (1968) and many other publications. Special mention should be made of Late Abbas Uddin, a scholar, accomplished singer, and collector of folksongs. His influence in the contemporary folklore movement of our country is immense. Hundreds of his genuine folksong records pressed by commercial recording companies sold like hot cakes. Popularly known as the father of Bengali Folk-songs, Abbas Uddin has made folksongs popular and has created a school of folksingers in Bangladesh. These three scholars, Muhammad Monsooruddin, Jassim Uddin and Abbas Uddin, represented the country at Folklore Conferences held in London, at Indian a university in Bloomington and the Germany, in past years.
He wrote several biography books including Iraner Kobi (1968), a biography of Muhammad titled Hazrat Muhammader Jiboni O Sadhona, Hazrat Shah Waliullah and Harun Rashid. His books for children included Bokami (1952), Thokami (1958) and Mushkil Ahsan (1958). He compiled a dictionary of Bengali idioms under the title Hashir Ovidhan in 1957.
He is one of the pioneers of Bengali folklore collection and research. Owing to rural origin, he was aware of folklore ballads and songs of oral tradition. He was impressed by the richness of Bengali folk music and decided to collect them before they are fully lost into oblivion. Starting from 1920s, he travelled from place to place and met people to collect folk songs that spread through oral medium. For Haramoni, he visited hundreds of villages of Rajshahi, Pabna, Nadia, Murshidabad, Mymensingh, Faridpur, Barisal, Noakhali and Dhaka. He was encouraged by the works of Rabindranath Tagore, Kshitimohan Sen, Pallikobi Jasimuddin, singer Abbas Uddin and painter Zainul Abedin. He was inspired when his collection of a song of Lalon Fakir sung by Premdasa Bairagi was published in the Haramoni section of the monthly literary magazine Probashi. It is quoted below.

Haramoni
Haramoni was the name of a regular section of monthly literary magazine Probashi that was dedicated to publishing folk songs collected from rural areas. Mansoor uddin picked up this name for publishing his collection of folklore. The first volume of Haramoni (Lost Jewels in English translation), essentially an anthology of Baul songs, was published in 1931. Mansuruddin himself published this volume, which was printed by Karim Box Brothers. Nobel Laureate poet Rabindranath Tagore wrote the preface of the book when its first volume was published. In 1942, the second volume was published by the Calcutta University. In 1948, Mansuruddin took initiative to publish the third volume of Haramoni. The University of Dhaka published the fourth volume in 1959. The manuscript contained 400 songs, and as many as 300 of them got lost. The fourth volume contained many songs of Pagla Kanai. The fifth volume was edited by Muhammad Abdul Hye and published by the Department of Bengali, Dhaka University, in 1961. It contained many songs by Lalon Fakir and Pagla Kanai. Again it is Mansoor uddin who at his own initiative published the sixth volume of Haramoni in 1967. However, by then, the Bangla Academy had published the seventh volume in 1964. The sixth volume contained nearly two hundred songs of Lalon Fakir. The seventh contained about seven hundred songs, many of which were collected from Sylhet area. Also, there was some of Panjeri Shah or Panju Shah. Mansuruddin added an 84 pages long introduction to this volume that focused on the lives of Hason Raja, Panju Shah, Shitalansha Shah, Arkum Shah, Monomhon, Radharaman, Dwija Das, Sheikh Bhanu, Qurban, Abdul Jabber, Madan Ganbi, Shah Mohammad Yasin, Ram Gopal, Kala Chand Pagla, Ananta Goshai and Abdul Wahed, among others. The eighth volume contained more than eight hundred songs collected from Kushtia, Faridpur, Pabna and Dhaka. It was published in 1976. It is the Bangla Academy that published the ninth volume in 1988. However, the tenth volume was already published in 1984. The 13th volume was published in 1984 by the Bangladesh Folklore Parishad. As many as eight more volumes remain to be published by the Bangla Academy, Dhaka. Apart from Baul songs, Haramoni contains a huge number of rural songs of different categories like Meyeli gaan, Baro maishya and Deha Tatwa.

In more recent times, the fable has been variously treated by artists and set by musicians.

The stories
In the East
There is a theme common to the many different stories of this type that involves poor persons daydreaming of future wealth arising from a temporary possession. When they get carried away by their fantasy and start acting it out, they break the container on which their dream is founded and find themselves worse off. One of the earliest is included in the Indian Panchatantra as ""The brahman who built air-castles"". There a man speculates about the wealth that will flow from selling a pot of grain that he has been given, progressing through a series of sales of animals until he has enough to support a wife and family. The child misbehaves, his wife takes no heed, so he kicks her and in doing so upsets the pot that was to make his fortune. Other variants include Bidpai's ""The Poorman and the Flask of Oil"", ""The Barber's Tale of his Fifth Brother"" from The 1001 Nights and the Jewish story of ""The Dervish and the Honey Jar"".

The Western fable
At its first appearance in the 14th century Dialogus creaturarum, the story was told as a cautionary fable of a milkmaid who engages in detailed financial calculations of her profits. In a Castilian form it is told under the title ""Of what happened to a woman called Truhana"" in Don Juan Manuel's Tales of Count Lucanor (1335), illustrating the lesson that you should 'Confine your thoughts to what is real'. In this case it is the jar of honey from which she hopes to enrich herself that Truhana unbalances from her head.
The story gained lasting popularity after it was included in La Fontaine's Fables (VII.10). The charm of La Fontaine's poetic form apart, however, it differs little from the version recorded in his source, Bonaventure des Périers' Nouvelles récréations et joyeux devis (1558). There the fable is made an example of the practice of alchemists, who are like 'a good woman that was carrying a pot of milk to market and reckoning up her account as follows: she would sell it for half a sou and with that would buy a dozen eggs which she would set to hatch and have from them a dozen chicks; when they were grown she would have them castrated and then they would fetch five sous each, so that'd be at least a crown with which she would buy two piglets, a male and a female, and farrow a dozen more from them once they were grown, and they'd sell for twenty sous a piece after raising, making twelve francs with which she'd buy a mare that would have a fine foal. It would be really nice as it grew up, prancing about and neighing. And so happy was the good woman imagining this that she began to frisk in imitation of her foal, and that made the pot fall and all the milk spill. And down tumbled with it her eggs, her chickens, her capons, her mare and foal, the whole lot.' This has led to the proverb ""Don't count your chick(en)s until they hatch.""

In Britain the earliest appearance of the fable was in Bernard Mandeville's selection of adaptations from La Fontaine, which was published under the title Aesop dress'd (1704). The false connection with Aesop was continued by the story's reappearance in Robert Dodsley's Select fables of Esop and other fabulists (1761). Titled there ""The country maid and her milk pail"", it is prefaced with the sentiment that 'when men suffer their imagination to amuse them with the prospect of distant and uncertain improvements of their condition, they frequently sustain real losses by their inattention to those affairs in which they are immediately concerned'. The story is briefly told and ends with the pail being dislodged when the girl scornfully tosses her head in rejection of all the young men at the dance she was to attend, wearing a new dress to be bought with the proceeds of her commercial activities.
A different version was versified by Jefferys Taylor as ""The Milkmaid"" in his Aesop in Rhyme (1820). As in Bonaventure des Périers' telling, the bulk of the poem is given over to the long reckoning of prices. It ends with the maid toppling her pail by superciliously tossing her head in rejection of her former humble circumstances. The moral on which Taylor ends his poem is 'Reckon not your chickens before they are hatched', where a later collection has 'Count not...' The proverb fits the story and its lesson so well that one is tempted to speculate that it developed out of some earlier oral version of the fable, but the earliest recorded instance of it is in Thomas Howell's New Sonnets and Pretty Pamphlets (1570). The idiom used by La Fontaine in the course of his long conclusion is 'to build castles in Spain', of which he gives a few examples that make it clear that the meaning he intends is 'to dream of the impossible'. Avoiding that may well be what Bonaventure des Périers intended in telling his story too, but in the English versions the moral to be drawn is that to bring a plan to completion more than dreaming is required.
A version of the fable was written by the German poet Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim in the 18th century. It differs little from other retellings, apart from its conclusion. The woman confesses what has happened to her husband, who advises her to live in the here and now and be content with what she has rather than 'building castles in air'. Here he uses the German equivalent of La Fontaine's idiom. The story has also provided German with another idiomatic phrase, 'milkmaid's reckoning' (Milchmädchenrechnung), used of drawing naïve and false conclusions.

Artistic uses of the fable
Illustrations of La Fontaine's fables in books, limited as they are to the dismayed milkmaid looking down at her broken crock, are almost uniformly monotonous. An early exception is Jean-Baptiste Oudry's print in which the girl has fallen on her back (1755), an episode unsanctioned by the text. The explanation for the inelegant posture seems to be that the idiom la cruche casée (the broken pitcher) then meant the loss of virginity and so suggests a less innocent explanation of how the milk came to be spilt. Jean-Honoré Fragonard also depicts a fall in his picture of the fable (1770), although in this case the girl has tumbled forward and the smoke of her dreams spills from the pitcher at the same time as the milk. Other paintings that allude to the fable at the time include Jean-Baptiste Huet's ""The milkmaid"" (La Laitière, 1769) and François Boucher's ""The little milkmaid"" (1760). A Gobelins tapestry based on this was later to be presented to the king.
In the 19th century the story was taken up elsewhere. The American Symbolist, Albert Pinkham Ryder, painted his ""Perrette"" some time before 1890, taking its title from the name that La Fontaine gave his milkmaid. She walks abstractedly through a visionary landscape with the bucket balanced on her head. The Spanish Joaquín Sorolla y Bastida painted his ""The Milkmaid"" in 1890 and portrays a pensive girl seated on a flowering bank with her bucket overturned beside her. In Kate Greenaway's painting of 1893 she is seated instead on the steps of a cottage with the pail on the ground in a treatment that has been described as Pre-Raphaelite. In the following century, the fable is featured on one of Jean Vernon's (1897–1975) medals from the 1930s, where Perrette stands with a frieze of her lost beasts behind her.
The most celebrated statue of this subject is the bronze figure that the Russian artist Pavel Sokolov (1765–1831) made for the pleasure grounds planned by Tsar Nicholas I of Russia at his palace of Tsarskoye Selo. It shows the seated milkmaid weeping over her broken pot, which has been converted into a water feature by a channeled feed from a nearby spring. Originally it was called ""Girl with a pitcher"", but it became so celebrated that it is now better known as ""The Milkmaid of Tsarskoye Selo"". There is only a copy there today in what has become a public park, while the original is preserved in a St Petersburg museum. In fact several other copies have been made over the years. One was given by the wife of Nicholas I, the princess Charlotte of Prussia, as a birthday gift to her brother Karl in 1827. This was placed in the grounds of his Glienicke Palace near Berlin but was eventually destroyed during World War II; it is now replaced by a modern copy and is known as Die Milchfrau. Yet another was erected in the public park of Schloss Britz in 1998, and still another at Soukhanovo, near Moscow.

One of the reasons for the original statue's celebrity as 'the muse of Tsarskoye Selo' was its connection with the writer Alexander Pushkin, who stayed there in 1831 and had been inspired to write the poem ""The statue at Tsarskoye Selo"".

One day a girl with an urn
Let it drop on the boulder beneath her.
Sadly she sits and alone,
Uselessly holding the pieces.
But see! What marvel is this?
For the water pours yet from her vessel.
There she continues today,
Her gaze on this endless spring.
The lyric was set for piano and alto voice in 1899 by Cesar Cui and is still performed today.
La Fontaine's fable has been set by a number of French composers:

Jacques Offenbach as the fourth of his 6 Fables (1842)
Benjamin Godard, the first of his Six Fables de La Fontaine (Op. 17 1872/9)
Louis Lacombe for piano and voice (Op. 73.3, 1875)
Abbé Léon-Robert Brice, who set it to a traditional melody, adjusting the poem to six-syllable lines to fit the music
Isabelle Aboulker in the children's operetta La Fontaine et le Corbeau (1999)

Momal-Rano is considered to be one of the most popular folktales in Sindhi and Rajasthani literature.

Historical context
The story is considered to have occurred in the geographical belts of Rajasthan, India as well as Sindh, Pakistan. The belt that covers the geography of Rajasthan in relation to the story is Lodrawa or Lodhruva in Jaisalmer district; while the area in Sindh is Momal Ji Maari (Momal's Mansion) and her father's house in Ghotki district of the province. The story occurred in the times of Hameer Soomro, the King of Umerkot or Amarkot (now a district in the south-east of Sindh province in Pakistan), possibly in the mid-14th century.

Story
The king of Amarkot, Hameer Soomoro, along with his ministers, Rano Mahendhra, Seenharro Dhamachanni and Daunro Bhatyanni, used to go for hunting in the far flung areas of Amarkot and sometimes could even cross the boundaries of their little country for the adventure. Once during a hunting spree, these four men were encountered by a person who came across them accidentally.
They did not disclose to the fellow who they were and what they did. But the fellow engaged them in the story of what happened to him in the preceding days. He was a prince from the area near Kashmir, who had heard the legend of Momal's beauty and charm and got so inspired that he pursued the adventure, but when he approached the area where Momal lived, he was not only overpowered by her enchanting beauty but also the tricks and schemes played by her female servants/sisters, who not only robbed that prince of his wealth and material but also so confused him in multiple puzzles that he could do nothing else but save his life and run.
The story told by this prince was sufficient to intrigue those four friends. They extracted information from the prince about Momal's whereabouts and decided to pursue the same adventure.
The place where Momal lived was near Lodhruva, in the north-east of Umerkot. She lived with her seven (some historians say nine) sisters, the most famous of which being Somal and Natir, (some consider her to be Momal's servant rather than sister) in a palace called Kak Mahal (The Palace of Kak). It was a magical palace with labyrinths, puzzles, fake ponds, illusions and much more. It was a legend that anyone who wanted to be a suitor for Momal would undergo several obstacles, and the one who succeeded in reaching the palace unharmed would possibly be accepted as her consort. As the history suggested, almost everyone who approached Momal and her sisters/servants was robbed of everything, including their lives excluding a few like the prince from Kashmir who told the stories of his devastation.
Momal enjoyed legendary beauty. Somal was famous for intelligence; while Natir was known as a schemer. They worked collectively to enchant the suitors and overpower them. They could not let the suitors experience an easy task of puzzles they designed for them. As the luck would have it, Rano Mendhro, who was famously intelligent and brave, was the only person to successfully reach the palace, utterly unharmed. Momal was fairly impressed and that led him to be accepted as her consort. The King Hameer, along with other two ministers, left Rano Mendhro at Kak and left for Umerkot.
Rano and Momal kept meeting each other for long and their love story gained profundity of feelings from both sides. However, King Hameer felt jealous about Rano to have succeeded in overpowering the most beautiful woman in the world he personally knew. So he kept a check on Rano and asked him not to meet Momal. Rano being his minister had to abide by the orders of his King friend. But his passion about Momal did not let him stay peacefully away from her. So usually he left for Ludhruva on his camel in the evening after work and returned to Umerkot by the next morning. Whenever he did that, which he did pretty often, he tried to stealthily go and meet Momal, it was pretty long distance though. Somehow he was caught one day and the king imprisoned him. But for the old friendship sake the king released him with conditions not to meet Momal again. But this had not to happen. He continued the same pursuit.
Once Rano was unable to reach Kak, so Momal, out of passion and extreme wait for her beloved, asked her sister Somal to wear clothes like the ones Rano used to wear and slept by her side. The moment Rano arrived, he mistook Somal as Momal's lover and, in utter disgust, left the palace for Umerkot leaving behind his cane. As Momal woke up, she saw his cane and realized Rano had been to her room and seen her with Somal, rather mistaken Somal to be some man, and perhaps gone for good. This was too much for her. Momal waited for his return but to no avail. At last, when the push comes to shove, she resorted to go out for Rano in Umerkot. Disguised as a man, she finally searched him and stayed in Umerkot for some time. In a short span of time, Rano came to learn it was Momal, who had disguised herself. So he tried to go away from her. Then she pleaded him to forgive her for her mistake, which was basically not an intentional trick but an outburst of passionate feelings about Rano, and nothing else. Rano was too obstinate to forgive her. Out of desperation, she jumped in raging fire. When Rano came to learn this, he followed her in the same flames and got consumed by the same.

Historicity
The story of Momal-Rano is a combination of both fact and fiction. The names of places related to the tale are real, both within the boundaries of the province of Sindh and Rajasthan. However, the ideas of magic, Kak, concerns as to how Rano was able to travel so fast from Umerkot to Lodhruva almost every day etc. make it a legend. The story of Momal Rano has also been compared with the legend of Orpheus. In the Greek myth, Sirens, beautiful yet dangerous creatures, lured nearby sailors with their enchanting voices/music and led their ships to wreck on the rocky coast of their island, Anthemoessa, looted and destroyed the seafarers. Identically Momal and her servants/sister did the same at Kak Mahal. Orpheus was the one to overpower their music with his lyre and saved his ship. Rano overpowered the magical world of Momal and her company.

Metaphorical significance
The love of Momal and Rano is an allegorical metaphor for the love of the soul and divine. The separation and longing between two lovers parallels the separation of the Divine and the human soul and longing of both the divine and the human soul to merge and dissolve into each other much like Momal and Rano were unified in the burning fire. The human soul, ruh, longs for Allah and in absolute overpowering self abnegating devotion cares nothing for the world or society and seeks union with divinity in the crazed love experienced by Sufis.

Popular culture
The Momal Rano love story continues to inspire numerous modern songs, including ""Dastaan-e-Moomal"" by The Sketches from Coke Studio Pakistan (season 11): Episode 5.

The entire incident has been described as an example of mass hysteria in India.

History
In May 2001, reports circulated in New Delhi, India concerning a monkey-like creature that attacked people at night. Eyewitness accounts were often inconsistent, but usually described the creature as about four feet (120 cm) tall, covered in thick black hair, with a metal helmet, metal claws, glowing red eyes and three buttons on its chest. Some reports also claim that it wore roller-skates. Others, however, described the Monkey-man as having a more vulpine snout, and being up to eight feet tall, and muscular; it would leap from building to building.
Over 350 sightings of the Monkey-man were reported, as well as around 60 resulting in injuries. Police released artist's sketches of eyewitness accounts in an attempt to catch the creature. Two (by some reports, three) people reportedly died when they fell from the tops of buildings or down stairwells in a panic caused when they thought they were under attack.

In popular culture
Film
The appearance of Monkey-man in Old Delhi is the centre-point of the 2009 Hindi film Delhi-6 directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra. In the film, the creature is used as an allegory to represent the evil that resides inside every man alongside God (virtue).

Television
In 2012, the Hindi TV series Mrs. Kaushik Ki Paanch Bahuein featured a story track around the mystery of ""Kala Bandar"" (Black Monkey).

Music
The Monkey-man is referenced in ""Mysterious Man-Monkey"", the 12th track in American cello rock band Rasputina's 2011 album Great American Gingerbread: Rasputina Rarities & Neglected Items.

Print media
In the 2011 graphic novel Munkeeman by Tere Bin Laden director Abhishek Sharma, the creature is interpreted as a misunderstood superhero, who was the result of a science experiment gone wrong. The first edition, Munkeeman Vol 1 chronicled the creatures brief appearance in Delhi, and the second edition will feature the creature in Kanpur, based on the incidents reported in February 2002.

Legends
According to regional folklore, Mordhwaj was a devotee of Krishna and a great donor. Arjuna was proud that there is no greater devotee of Krishna than him. After Mahabharata War was over, Lord Krishna told Arjuna that I have a devotee greater than you and that is Mordhwaj. Krishna reached King Mordhwaj in a Brahmin disguise and said that Maharaj, my lion, is hungry and he is a cannibal. The king Mordhwaj said that if I would be his food, it will be my fortune. Krishna said that both of you, husband and wife, should cut off the head of your son and feed him meat. In the meantime, even a single tear comes out; then, the lion will not eat it. Thus the king Mordhwaj and his queen cut off their son's head and put it in front of the lion. Then Krishna blessed king Mordhwaj and his son was resurrected. Thus the king tested his devotee and Arjuna's pride was shattered.

Temples
A new temple has also been built near the ancient fort on the bank of Saryu River in Aalapur tehsil of Ambedkar Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh. In the Temple - Idol of King Mordhwaja along with his wife and son can be seen in a special stance which portrays the story of King Mordhwaj. A large number of devotees reach here every Sunday for bathing and worship. Chadipur Fort has its own special identity in the adjoining districts including Ambedkar Nagar, Azamgarh and Gorakhpur. Sadhus and saints from far-flung areas keep reaching this holy ghat throughout the year for worship.
A  temple dedicated to Mordhwaj is located in a village called Moonj in the Etawah district of Uttar Pradesh.
Mordhwaj established the Bageshwar Nath Shiv Temple at Arang in Raipur District of Chhattisgarh in the 11th century.
Mahamaya Mandir, a 1400 years old temple at Ratanpur in Bilaspur district was also built by King Mordhwaj. According to its priest Pandit Manoj Shukla, King Mordhwaj had built 36 forts in Chhattisgarh. After the construction of every fort, he used to build a temple of Mother Mahamaya. One of these temples is the Mahamaya temple located in Raipur, where Mother Mahamaya and Samleshwari Devi are viewed as Mahalaxmi.

Forts
A Mordhwaj fort is located at Mathurapur Mor village in Najibabad of Uttar Pradesh. The excavations, carried out at Mathurapurmor's Mordhwaj fort, which is locally known as Begam Kothi, located 15 kilometers from Kotdwara towards Najibabad, discovered antiques including terracotta, gold coins, potsherds decorated bricks and copper.
A police station in Bijnor district is named after King Mordhwaj. On the Meerut-Pauri National Highway, Najibabad and Kotdwar used to be the fort of King Mordhwaj. Its remnants are still available. In May 2021, the land has been allocated to construct the police station in Samirpur village.
There is another Mordhwaj Fort located on the bank of Saryu River in Aalapur tehsil of Ambedkar Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh. It is believed in the region that the fort was established by King Mordhwaj in Chadipur Kala, situated at a distance of 10 yojanas from Ayodhya. The force of time has neglected this ancient site.

This fable has the themes of incomplete transformation and the impossibility of changing character. It has received many treatments in literature, folklore and the arts.

The Mouse-Maid Made Mouse
The story found in the Panchatantra relates how a mouse drops from the beak of a bird of prey into the hands of a holy man, who turns it into a girl and brings her up as his own. Eventually he seeks a powerful marriage for her but discovers at each application that there is one more powerful:  thus the cloud can cover the sun, the wind blows the clouds about but is resisted by the mountain; the mountain, however, is penetrated by mice. Since the girl feels the call of like to like in this case, she is changed back to her original form and goes to live with her husband in his hole.
A variant of the tale appears among the Folk-Tales of Bengal under the name ""The Origin of Opium"". There, a holy man grants a mouse's successive wishes to become more than itself until it is changed into a woman fair enough to catch a king's eye. When she dies soon after in an accident, a mood-changing opium plant grows from her burial place.
The ancient Indian fable was eventually translated into Pahlavi and then into Arabic, but before a version of any of these works had reached Europe the fable appeared in Marie de France's Ysopet as a cautionary tale against social climbing through marrying above one's station. The creature involved is an ambitious field mouse who applies to the sun for the hand of his daughter. He is sent on to a cloud, the wind, a tower, and then the mouse that undermines it, to the humbling of his aspirations.
The theme of keeping to one's class reappears in a Romanian folk variant in which a rat sets out to pay God a visit. He applies to the sun and to clouds for directions, but neither will answer such a creature; then he asks the wind, which picks him up and flings him on an ant-heap - 'and there he found his level', the story concludes. A less harsh judgement is exhibited in Japanese and Korean variants where the father seeking a powerful match for his daughter is sent round the traditional characters of sun, cloud and wind, only to discover that he too has his place on the ladder of power. All these are animal fables that lack the transformation theme. In the Japanese case a rat is involved and in the Korean a mole.
The later version in La Fontaine's Fables, ""The Mouse Metamorphosed into a Maid"" (IX.7), acknowledges the story's Indian origin by making it a Brahmin who fosters the mouse and gives it back the body it had in a former birth. La Fontaine feigns shock at all this and finds at the story's culmination, in which the girl falls in love with the burrowing rat at the mere mention of its name, an argument to confound the Eastern fabulist's beliefs:

In all respects, compared and weigh'd,
The souls of men and souls of mice
Quite different are made -
Unlike in sort as well as size.
Each fits and fills its destined part
As Heaven doth well provide;
Nor witch, nor fiend, nor magic art,
Can set their laws aside.
The fable’s philosophical theme inspired the American poet Marianne Moore to a wry  and idiosyncratic recreation in her version of La Fontaine (1954):

We are what we were at birth, and each trait has remained
in conformity with earth's and with heaven's logic:
Be the devil's tool, resort to black magic,
None can diverge from the ends which Heaven foreordained.
This in turn was set for unaccompanied soprano by the British composer Alexander Goehr in 1992 (Opus 54).

Venus and the Cat
The Indian fable's western equivalent is the story of ""Venus (or Aphrodite) and the Cat"", which goes back to Classical times and is given the moral that nature is stronger than nurture. It figures as number 50 in the Perry Index and its many versions feature a cat turned into a woman by the goddess, who then tests her on the wedding night by introducing a mouse into the bedchamber. In the Greek version by Babrius, however, it is a weasel (γαλῆ) that falls in love with a man and begs Aphrodite to change her into a human, but then goes chasing after a mouse in the middle of the marriage feast. In ancient times it was speculated that the Greek proverb ‘a saffron (wedding) robe does not suit a weasel’ was connected with the fable and has much the same meaning that one’s underlying nature does not change with circumstances.

These tradition-loving and ritual-performing community moves from place to place, narrating the stories of their caste gods. Oggus are the traditional priests of the Golla Kurumas and perform the marriage of Mallanna with Bhramaramba.

Etymology
The story narrated about Lord Mallanna or Mallikarjuna Swamy  using the instrument ""Jaggu""(damarukam) is known as Oggu Katha. Used at the beginning of each story and also at the marriage festival of Lord Mallanna.
Founder of Oggu kathalu was Sri. Vallam Pedda Veeraiah which was continued by his son Vishwa Vikyatha Oggu Katha Sarva Bhoumulu Vallam Sathaiah. The stories, scripts, dialogues and lyrics on Kommaravelli Mallana, Yellama Devi, Nalla Pochamma Devi were all developed by Vallam Sathaiah.
This tradition was carried forward by the successors of Vallam Sataiah Sons Vallam Veeresham Yadav and Vallam Mahesh . They made Oggu Kathalu famous through many Stage shows, TV and Radio programs. Vallam Sataiah taught many students the complete concepts of Oggu Katha. It is because of this knowledge sharing, Oggu Katha has been spread to various parts of the country.
Vallam Veeresham Yadav is the founder of AP ""Oggu Pujarula Sangham"" which is based in Hyderabad providing a respectable living to many families. Inspired by his elder brother, Vallam Mahesh Yadav laid foundation to the Telangana Oggu Pujarula Sangham and is very famous for his Dolu vaidyam.
The popular names in Oggu katha artists are Chukka Sattaiah  made oggu katha famous worldwide.
Chukka Sattaiah famous for Beerappa oggu katha, mallanna oggu katha, sri mandatha oggu katha with his melodious voice which attracts the Telangana people.

Telangana government is focusing on Propagating the culture of Oggu Katha.

The group
The Oggu performers narrate the stories of Mallanna and Beerappa and Shakti ballads, of Yellamma. These ballads are in 'manjari dwipada', containing lyrical prose, recited with great oratorical and rhetorical nuances.
The team consists of four to six members. The main narrator, an assisting narrator, and at least two instrumentalists - one playing on a big drum called 'rana bheri' and the other on brass talas of a big size. Another member plays on a kanjira and the sixth one sings along with the narrator and also plays a napheera, a wind instrument, used at times of martial valor.

The performance
Oggu katha artists perform Kalyanam (marriage) of Lord Mallikarjuna Swamy with his wife's Lord Golla Kethamma and Medalamma. 
The narrate the stories of Lord Mallana and his sister Lord Yellama Devi. Instruments used like Jaggu (damarukam), Dolu and Thalam.
The narrator and his chorus i.e. two narrators-help in dramatizing the narration as very often, they transform themselves into two characters. The dramatization of the narrative is what gives the Oggu Katha its predominant place especially in Telangana, where Oggu Katha prevalent. The singers (oggu katha artists) and devotees visit the pilgrimage place Komaravelli Mallanna Temple every year which is located on a hill called Indrakeeladri in Komuravelli village, located in Warangal District, of Telangana state, India.

The chief narrator wears a big pant tied up to the knees, a colored shirt, a colored head cloth, a colored waistcloth, and ankle bells. The other narrator also will have the same dress. More than the costume, the ornaments they have to wear are traditionally considered more important. The main narrator will have a chain made of seven shells called 'gavvala darshanam'.
There is a legend regarding this chain of shells. It was said that seven brothers of Bhramaramba (Mallanna's consort) fought with him at the time of her wedding. Mallanna defeated them and cursed them to be dogs. When Bhramaramba entreated the Lord to save them from the curse, he graced them by asking them to be Oggus and narrate his stories. The seven shells symbolize the seven brothers and are given a prominent place while narrating the story.
In addition, they wear five silver rings and five silver chains (jogirly), a wrist band (ponchi), thick silver rings (kadiyam) around the neck, to the right wrist and to the upper arm, a three - layered garland made of pagadam (sapphire) and round silver nooses (tavalam), ande and matte to the fingers of the foot and a garland with Mallana's portrait on it (ambarala golusu). During the course of action, he also wears a stick, which serves also as a sword or the chains of a horse.
Oggus Katha allows tremendous scope for dramatization. In the hands of an able narrator, it becomes a very inspiring one, because of the innumerable improvisations introduced, along with the traditional way of rendering the story.

Author and chronology
The prelude section of the Panchatantra identifies an octogenarian Brahmin named Vishnusharma (IAST: Viṣṇuśarman) as its author. He is stated to be teaching the principles of good government to three princes of Amarasakti. It is unclear, states Patrick Olivelle, a professor of Sanskrit and Indian religions, if Vishnusharma was a real person or himself a literary invention. Some South Indian recensions of the text, as well as Southeast Asian versions of Panchatantra attribute the text to Vasubhaga, states Olivelle. Based on the content and mention of the same name in other texts dated to ancient and medieval era centuries, most scholars agree that Vishnusharma is a fictitious name. Olivelle and other scholars state that regardless of who the author was, it is likely ""the author was a Hindu, and not a Buddhist, nor Jain"", but it is unlikely that the author was a devotee of Hindu god Vishnu because the text neither expresses any sentiments against other Hindu deities such as Shiva, Indra and others, nor does it avoid invoking them with reverence.
Various locations where the text was composed have been proposed but this has been controversial. Some of the proposed locations include Kashmir, Southwestern or South India. The text's original language was likely Sanskrit. Though the text is now known as Panchatantra, the title found in old manuscript versions varies regionally, and includes names such as Tantrakhyayika, Panchakhyanaka, Panchakhyana and Tantropakhyana. The suffix akhyayika and akhyanaka mean ""little story"" or ""little story book"" in Sanskrit.
The text was translated into Pahlavi in 550 CE, which forms the latest limit of the text's existence. The earliest limit is uncertain. It quotes identical verses from Arthasastra, which is broadly accepted to have been completed by the early centuries of the common era. According to Olivelle, ""the current scholarly consensus places the Panchatantra around 300 CE, although we should remind ourselves that this is only an educated guess"". The text quotes from older genre of Indian literature, and legends with anthropomorphic animals are found in more ancient texts dated to the early centuries of the 1st millennium BCE such as the chapter 4.1 of the Chandogya Upanishad. According to Gillian Adams, Panchatantra may be a product of the Vedic period, but its age cannot be ascertained with confidence because ""the original Sanskrit version has been lost"".

Content
The Panchatantra is a series of inter-woven fables, many of which deploy metaphors of anthropomorphized animals with human virtues and vices. Its narrative illustrates, for the benefit of three ignorant princes, the central Hindu principles of nīti. While nīti is hard to translate, it roughly means prudent worldly conduct, or ""the wise conduct of life"".
Apart from a short introduction, it consists of five parts. Each part contains a main story, called the frame story, which in turn contains several embedded stories, as one character narrates a story to another. Often these stories contain further embedded stories. The stories operate like a succession of Russian dolls, one narrative opening within another, sometimes three or four deep. Besides the stories, the characters also quote various epigrammatic verses to make their point.
The five books have their own subtitles.

Book 1: Mitra-bheda
The first treatise features a jackal named Damanaka, as the unemployed minister in a kingdom ruled by a lion. He, along with his moralizing sidekick named Karataka, conspire to break up alliances and friendships of the lion king. A series of fables describe the conspiracies and causes that lead to close and inseparable friends breaking up.
The Book 1 contains over thirty fables, with the version Arthur Ryder translated containing 34: The Loss of Friends, The Wedge-Pulling Monkey, The Jackal and the War-Drum, Merchant Strong-Tooth, Godly and June, The Jackal at the Ram-Fight, The Weaver's Wife, How the Crow-Hen Killed the Black Snake, The Heron that Liked Crab-Meat, Numskull and the Rabbit, The Weaver Who Loved a Princess, The Ungrateful Man, Leap and Creep, The Blue Jackal, Passion and the Owl, Ugly's Trust Abused, The Lion and the Carpenter, The Plover Who Fought the Ocean, Shell-Neck Slim and Grim, Forethought Readywit and Fatalist, The Duel Between Elephant and Sparrow, The Shrewd Old Gander, The Lion and the Ram, Smart the Jackal, The Monk Who Left His Body Behind, The Girl Who Married a Snake, Poor Blossom, The Unteachable Monkey, Right-Mind and Wrong-Mind, A Remedy Worse than the Disease, The Mice That Ate Iron, The Results of Education, The Sensible Enemy, The Foolish Friend.
It is the longest of the five books, making up roughly 45% of the work's length.

Book 2: Mitra-samprāpti
The second treatise is quite different in structure than the remaining books, states Olivelle, as it does not truly embed fables. It is a collection of adventures of four characters: a crow (scavenger, not a predator, airborne habits), a mouse (tiny, underground habits), a turtle (slow, water habits) and a deer (a grazing animal viewed by other animals as prey, land habits). The overall focus of the book is the reverse of the first book. Its theme is to emphasize the importance of friendships, team work, and alliances. It teaches, ""weak animals with very different skills, working together can accomplish what they cannot when they work alone"", according to Olivelle. United through their cooperation and in their mutual support, the fables describe how they are able to outwit all external threats and prosper.
The second book contains ten fables: The Winning of Friends, The Bharunda Birds, Gold's Gloom, Mother Shandilee's Bargain, Self-defeating Forethought, Mister Duly, Soft, the Weaver, Hang-Ball and Greedy, The Mice That Set Elephant Free, Spot's Captivity.
Book 2 makes up about 22% of the total length.

Book 3: Kākolūkīyam
The third treatise discusses war and peace, presenting through animal characters a moral about the battle of wits being a strategic means to neutralize a vastly superior opponent's army. The thesis in this treatise is that a battle of wits is a more potent force than a battle of swords. The choice of animals embeds a metaphor of a war between good versus evil, and light versus darkness. Crows are good, weaker and smaller in number and are creatures of the day (light), while owls are presented as evil, numerous and stronger creatures of the night (darkness). The crow king listens to the witty and wise counsel of Ciramjivin, while the owl king ignores the counsel of Raktaksa. The good crows win.
The fables in the third book, as well as others, do not strictly limit to matters of war and peace. Some present fables that demonstrate how different characters have different needs and motives, which is subjectively rational from each character's viewpoint, and that addressing these needs can empower peaceful relationships even if they start off in a different way. For example, in the fable The Old Man the Young Wife, the text relates a story wherein an old man marries a young woman from a penniless family. The young woman detests his appearance so much that she refuses to even look at him let alone consummate their marriage. One night, while she sleeps in the same bed with her back facing the old man, a thief enters their house. She is scared, turns over, and for security embraces the man. This thrills every limb of the old man. He feels grateful to the thief for making his young wife hold him at last. The aged man rises and profusely thanks the thief, requesting the intruder to take whatever he desires.
The third book contains eighteen fables in Ryder translation: Crows and Owls, How the Birds Picked a King, How the Rabbit Fooled the Elephant, The Cat's Judgment, The Brahmin's Goat, The Snake and the Ants, The Snake Who Paid Cash, The Unsocial Swans, The Self-sacrificing Dove, The Old Man with the Young Wife, The Brahmin, The Thief and the Ghost, The Snake in the Prince's Belly, The Gullible Carpenter, Mouse-Maid Made Mouse, The Bird with Golden Dung, The Cave That Talked, The Frog That Rode Snakeback, The Butter-blinded Brahmin.
This is about 26% of the total length.

Book 4: Labdhapraṇāśam
The book four of the Panchatantra is a simpler compilation of ancient moral-filled fables. These, states Olivelle, teach messages such as ""a bird in hand is worth two in the bush"". They caution the reader to avoid succumbing to peer pressure and cunning intent wrapped in soothing words. The book is different from the first three, in that the earlier books give positive examples of ethical behavior offering examples and actions ""to do"". In contrast, book four presents negative examples with consequences, offering examples and actions ""to avoid, to watch out for"".
The fourth book contains thirteen fables in Ryder translation: Loss of Gains, The Monkey and the Crocodile, Handsome and Theodore, Flop-Ear and Dusty, The Potter Militant, The Jackal Who Killed No Elephants, The Ungrateful Wife, King Joy and Secretary Splendor, The Ass in the Tiger-Skin, The Farmer's Wife, The Pert Hen-Sparrow, How Supersmart Ate the Elephant, The Dog Who Went Abroad.
Book 4, along with Book 5, is very short. Together the last two books constitute about 7% of the total text.

Book 5: Aparīkṣitakārakaṃ
Book five of the text is, like book four, a simpler compilation of moral-filled fables. These also present negative examples with consequences, offering examples and actions for the reader to ponder, avoid, and watch out for. The lessons in this last book include ""get facts, be patient, don't act in haste then regret later"", ""don't build castles in the air"". The book five is also unusual in that almost all its characters are humans, unlike the first four where the characters are predominantly anthropomorphized animals. According to Olivelle, it may be that the text's ancient author sought to bring the reader out of the fantasy world of talking and pondering animals into the realities of the human world.
The fifth book contains twelve fables about hasty actions or jumping to conclusions without establishing facts and proper due diligence. In Ryder translation, they are: Ill-considered Action, The Loyal Mongoose, The Four Treasure-Seekers, The Lion-Makers, Hundred-Wit Thousand-Wit and Single-Wit, The Musical Donkey, Slow the Weaver, The Brahman's Dream, The Unforgiving Monkey, The Credulous Fiend, The Three-Breasted Princess, The Fiend Who Washed His Feet.
One of the fables in this book is the story of a woman and a mongoose. She leaves her child with a mongoose friend. When she returns, she sees blood on the mongoose's mouth, and kills the friend, believing the animal killed her child. The woman discovers her child alive, and learns that the blood on the mongoose mouth came from it biting the snake while defending her child from the snake's attack. She regrets having killed the friend because of her hasty action.

Links with other fables
The fables of Panchatantra are found in numerous world languages. It is also considered partly the origin of European secondary works, such as folk tale motifs found in Boccaccio, La Fontaine and the works of Grimm Brothers. For a while, this had led to the hypothesis that popular worldwide animal-based fables had origins in India and the Middle East. According to Max Muller,

Sanskrit literature is very rich in fables and stories; no other literature can vie with it in that respect; nay, it is extremely likely that fables, in particular animal fables, had their principal source in India.

This monocausal hypothesis has now been generally discarded in favor of polygenetic hypothesis which states that fable motifs had independent origins in many ancient human cultures, some of which have common roots and some influenced by co-sharing of fables. The shared fables implied morals that appealed to communities separated by large distances and these fables were therefore retained, transmitted over human generations with local variations. However, many post-medieval era authors explicitly credit their inspirations to texts such as ""Bidpai"" and ""Pilpay, the Indian sage"" that are known to be based on the Panchatantra.
According to Niklas Bengtsson, even though India being the exclusive original source of animal fables is no longer taken seriously, the ancient classic Panchatantra, ""which new folklore research continues to illuminate, was certainly the first work ever written down for children, and this in itself means that the Indian influence has been enormous [on fables around the world], not only on the genres of fables and fairy tales, but on those genres as taken up in children's literature"". According to Adams and Bottigheimer, the fables of Panchatantra are known in at least 38 languages around the world in 112 versions by Jacob's old estimate, and its relationship with Mesopotamian and Greek fables is hotly debated in part because the original manuscripts of all three ancient texts have not survived. Olivelle states that there are 200 versions of the text in more than 50 languages around the world, in addition to a version in nearly every major language of India.
Scholars have noted the strong similarity between a few of the stories in The Panchatantra and Aesop's Fables. Examples are The Ass in the Panther's Skin and The Ass without Heart and Ears. The Broken Pot is similar to Aesop's The Milkmaid and Her Pail, The Gold-Giving Snake is similar to Aesop's The Man and the Serpent and Le Paysan et Dame serpent by Marie de France (Fables) Other well-known stories include The Tortoise and The Geese and The Tiger, the Brahmin and the Jackal. Similar animal fables are found in most cultures of the world, although some folklorists view India as the prime source. The Panchatantra has been a source of the world's fable literature.
The French fabulist Jean de La Fontaine acknowledged his indebtedness to the work in the introduction to his Second Fables:

""This is a second book of fables that I present to the public... I have to acknowledge that the greatest part is inspired from Pilpay, an Indian Sage"".
The Panchatantra is the origin also of several stories in Arabian Nights, Sindbad, and of many Western nursery rhymes and ballads.

Origins and function
In the Indian tradition, The Panchatantra is a nītiśāstra. Nīti can be roughly translated as ""the wise conduct of life"" and a śāstra is a technical or scientific treatise; thus it is considered a treatise on political science and human conduct. Its literary sources are ""the expert tradition of political science and the folk and literary traditions of storytelling"". It draws from the Dharma and Artha śāstras, quoting them extensively. It is also explained that nīti ""represents an admirable attempt to answer the insistent question how to win the utmost possible joy from life in the world of men"" and that nīti is ""the harmonious development of the powers of man, a life in which security, prosperity, resolute action, friendship, and good learning are so combined to produce joy"".
The Panchatantra shares many stories in common with the Buddhist Jataka tales, purportedly told by the historical Buddha before his death around 400 BCE. As the scholar Patrick Olivelle writes, ""It is clear that the Buddhists did not invent the stories. [...] It is quite uncertain whether the author of [the Panchatantra] borrowed his stories from the Jātakas or the Mahābhārata, or whether he was tapping into a common treasury of tales, both oral and literary, of ancient India."" Many scholars believe the tales were based on earlier oral folk traditions, which were finally written down, although there is no conclusive evidence. In the early 20th century, W. Norman Brown found that many folk tales in India appeared to be borrowed from literary sources and not vice versa.

An early Western scholar who studied The Panchatantra was Dr. Johannes Hertel, who thought the book had a Machiavellian character. Similarly, Edgerton noted that ""the so-called 'morals' of the stories have no bearing on morality; they are unmoral, and often immoral. They glorify shrewdness and practical wisdom, in the affairs of life, and especially of politics, of government."" Other scholars dismiss this assessment as one-sided, and view the stories as teaching dharma, or proper moral conduct. Also:

On the surface, the Pañcatantra presents stories and sayings which favor the outwitting of roguery, and practical intelligence rather than virtue. However, [...] From this viewpoint the tales of the Pañcatantra are eminently ethical. [...] the prevailing mood promotes an earthy, moral, rational, and unsentimental ability to learn from repeated experience[.]
According to Olivelle, ""Indeed, the current scholarly debate regarding the intent and purpose of the 'Pañcatantra' — whether it supports unscrupulous Machiavellian politics or demands ethical conduct from those holding high office — underscores the rich ambiguity of the text"". Konrad Meisig states that the Panchatantra has been incorrectly represented by some as ""an entertaining textbook for the education of princes in the Machiavellian rules of Arthasastra"", but instead it is a book for the ""Little Man"" to develop ""Niti"" (social ethics, prudent behavior, shrewdness) in their pursuit of Artha, and a work on social satire. According to Joseph Jacobs, ""... if one thinks of it, the very raison d'être of the Fable is to imply its moral without mentioning it.""
The Panchatantra, states Patrick Olivelle, tells wonderfully a collection of delightful stories with pithy proverbs, ageless and practical wisdom; one of its appeal and success is that it is a complex book that ""does not reduce the complexities of human life, government policy, political strategies, and ethical dilemmas into simple solutions; it can and does speak to different readers at different levels."" In the Indian tradition, the work is a Shastra genre of literature, more specifically a Nitishastra text.
The text has been a source of studies on political thought in Hinduism, as well as the management of Artha with a debate on virtues and vices.

Metaphors and layered meanings
The Sanskrit version of the Panchatantra text gives names to the animal characters, but these names are creative with double meanings. The names connote the character observable in nature but also map a human personality that a reader can readily identify. For example, the deer characters are presented as a metaphor for the charming, innocent, peaceful and tranquil personality who is a target for those who seek a prey to exploit, while the crocodile is presented to symbolize dangerous intent hidden beneath a welcoming ambiance (waters of a lotus flower-laden pond). Dozens of different types of wildlife found in India are thus named, and they constitute an array of symbolic characters in the Panchatantra. Thus, the names of the animals evoke layered meaning that resonates with the reader, and the same story can be read at different levels.

Cross-cultural migrations
The work has gone through many different versions and translations from the sixth century to the present day. The original Indian version was first translated into a foreign language (Pahlavi) by Borzūya in 570 CE, then into Arabic in 750. This Arabic version was translated into several languages, including Syriac, Greek, Persian, Hebrew and Spanish, and thus became the source of versions in European languages, until the English translation by Charles Wilkins of the Sanskrit Hitopadesha in 1787.

Early cross-cultural migrations
The Panchatantra approximated its current literary form within the 4th–6th centuries CE, though originally written around 200 BCE. No Sanskrit texts before 1000 CE have survived. Buddhist monks on pilgrimage to India took the influential Sanskrit text (probably both in oral and literary formats) north to Tibet and China and east to South East Asia. These led to versions in all Southeast Asian countries, including Tibetan, Chinese, Mongolian, Javanese and Lao derivatives.

How Borzuy brought the work from India
The Panchatantra also migrated into the Middle East, through Iran, during the Sassanid reign of Anoushiravan. Around 550 CE his notable physician Borzuy (Burzuwaih) translated the work from Sanskrit into the Pahlavi (Middle Persian language). He transliterated the main characters as Karirak ud Damanak.

According to the story told in the Shāh Nāma (The Book of the Kings, Persia's late 10th-century national epic by Ferdowsi), Borzuy sought his king's permission to make a trip to Hindustan in search of a mountain herb he had read about that is ""mingled into a compound and, when sprinkled over a corpse, it is immediately restored to life."" He did not find the herb, but was told by a wise sage of ""a different interpretation. The herb is the scientist; science is the mountain, everlastingly out of reach of the multitude. The corpse is the man without knowledge, for the uninstructed man is everywhere lifeless. Through knowledge man becomes revivified.""
The sage pointed to the book, and the visiting physician Borzuy translated the work with the help of some Pandits (Brahmins). According to Hans Bakker, Borzuy visited the kingdom of Kannauj in north India during the 6th century in an era of intense exchange between Persian and Indian royal courts, and he secretly translated a copy of the text then sent it to the court of Anoushiravan in Persia, along with other cultural and technical knowledge.

Kalila wa Demna: Mid. Persian and Arabic versions
Borzuy's translation of the Sanskrit version into Pahlavi arrived in Persia by the 6th century, but this Middle Persian version is now lost. The book had become popular in Sassanid, and was translated into Syriac and Arabic whose copies survive. According to Riedel, ""the three preserved New Persian translations originated between the 10th and 12th century"", and are based on the 8th-century Arabic translation by Ibn al-Muqaffa of Borzuy's work on Panchatantra. It is the 8th-century Kalila wa Demna text, states Riedel, that has been the most influential of the known Arabic versions, not only in the Middle East, but also through its translations into Greek, Hebrew and Old Spanish.
The Persian Ibn al-Muqaffa' translated the Panchatantra (in Middle Persian: Kalilag-o Demnag) from Middle Persian to Arabic as Kalīla wa Dimna. This is considered the first masterpiece of ""Arabic literary prose.""

The introduction of the first book of Kalila wa Demna is different from Panchatantra, in being more elaborate and instead of king and his three sons studying in the Indian version, the Persian version speaks of a merchant and his three sons who had squandered away their father's wealth. The Persian version also makes an abrupt switch from the story of the three sons to an injured ox, and thereafter parallels the Panchatantra.
The two jackals' names transmogrified into Kalila and Dimna in the Persian version. Perhaps because the first section constituted most of the work, or because translators could find no simple equivalent in Zoroastrian Pahlavi for the concept expressed by the Sanskrit word 'Panchatantra', the jackals' names, Kalila and Dimna, became the generic name for the entire work in classical times.
After the first chapter, Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ inserted a new one, telling of Dimna's trial. The jackal is suspected of instigating the death of the bull ""Shanzabeh"", a key character in the first chapter. The trial lasts for two days without conclusion, until a tiger and leopard appear to bear witness against Dimna. He is found guilty and put to death.
Ibn al-Muqaffa' inserted other additions and interpretations into his 750CE ""re-telling"" (see Francois de Blois' Burzōy's voyage to India and the origin of the book Kalīlah wa Dimnah).  The political theorist Jennifer London suggests that he was expressing risky political views in a metaphorical way. (Al-Muqaffa' was murdered within a few years of completing his manuscript). London has analysed how Ibn al-Muqaffa' could have used his version to make ""frank political expression"" at the 'Abbasid court (see J. London's ""How To Do Things With Fables: Ibn al-Muqaffa's Frank Speech in Stories from Kalila wa Dimna,"" History of Political Thought XXIX: 2 (2008)).

The Arabic classic by Ibn al-Muqaffa
Borzuy's 570 CE Pahlavi translation (Kalile va Demne, now lost) was translated into Syriac. Nearly two centuries later, it was translated into Arabic by Ibn al-Muqaffa around 750 CE under the Arabic title, Kalīla wa Dimna. After the Arab invasion of Persia (Iran), Ibn al-Muqaffa's version (two languages removed from the pre-Islamic Sanskrit original) emerged as the pivotal surviving text that enriched world literature. Ibn al-Muqaffa's work is considered a model of the finest Arabic prose style, and ""is considered the first masterpiece of Arabic literary prose.""
Some scholars believe that Ibn al-Muqaffa's translation of the second section, illustrating the Sanskrit principle of Mitra Laabha (Gaining Friends), became the unifying basis for the Brethren of Purity (Ikwhan al-Safa) — the anonymous 9th-century CE encyclopedists whose prodigious literary effort, Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Sincerity, codified Indian, Persian and Greek knowledge. A suggestion made by Goldziher, and later written on by Philip K. Hitti in his History of the Arabs, proposes that ""The appellation is presumably taken from the story of the ringdove in Kalilah wa-Dimnah in which it is related that a group of animals by acting as faithful friends (ikhwan al-safa) to one another escaped the snares of the hunter."" This story is mentioned as an exemplum when the Brethren speak of mutual aid in one risaala (treatise), a crucial part of their system of ethics.

Spread to the rest of Europe
Almost all pre-modern European translations of the Panchatantra arise from this Arabic version. From Arabic it was re-translated into Syriac in the 10th or 11th century, into Greek (as Stephanites and Ichnelates) in 1080 by the Jewish Byzantine doctor Simeon Seth, into 'modern' Persian by Abu'l-Ma'ali Nasrallah Munshi in 1121, and in 1252 into Spanish (old Castilian, Calila e Dimna).
Perhaps most importantly, it was translated into Hebrew by Rabbi Joel in the 12th century. This Hebrew version was translated into Latin by John of Capua as  Directorium Humanae Vitae, or ""Directory of Human Life"", and printed in 1480, and became the source of most European versions.
A German translation, Das Buch der Beispiele, of the Panchatantra was printed in 1483, making this one of the earliest books to be printed by Gutenberg's press after the Bible.
The Latin version was translated into Italian by Antonfrancesco Doni in 1552. This translation became the basis for the first English translation, in 1570: Sir Thomas North translated it into Elizabethan English as The Fables of Bidpai: The Morall Philosophie of Doni (reprinted by Joseph Jacobs, 1888). La Fontaine published The Fables of Bidpai in 1679, based on ""the Indian sage Pilpay"".

Modern era
It was the Panchatantra that served as the basis for the studies of Theodor Benfey, the pioneer in the field of comparative literature. His efforts began to clear up some confusion surrounding the history of the Panchatantra, culminating in the work of Hertel (Hertel 1908, Hertel 1912a, Hertel 1912b, Hertel 1915) and Edgerton (1924). Hertel discovered several recensions in India, in particular the oldest available Sanskrit recension, the Tantrakhyayika in Kashmir, and the so-called North Western Family Sanskrit text by the Jain monk Purnabhadra in 1199 CE that blends and rearranges at least three earlier versions. Edgerton undertook a minute study of all texts which seemed ""to provide useful evidence on the lost Sanskrit text to which, it must be assumed, they all go back"", and believed he had reconstructed the original Sanskrit Panchatantra; this version is known as the Southern Family text.
Among modern translations, Arthur W. Ryder's translation (Ryder 1925), translating prose for prose and verse for rhyming verse, remains popular. In the 1990s two English versions of the Panchatantra were published, Chandra Rajan's translation (like Ryder's, based on Purnabhadra's recension) by Penguin (1993), and Patrick Olivelle's translation (based on Edgerton's reconstruction of the ur-text) by Oxford University Press (1997). Olivelle's translation was republished in 2006 by the Clay Sanskrit Library.
Recently Ibn al-Muqaffa's historical milieu itself, when composing his masterpiece in Baghdad during the bloody Abbasid overthrow of the Umayyad dynasty, has become the subject (and rather confusingly, also the title) of a gritty Shakespearean drama by the multicultural Kuwaiti playwright Sulayman Al-Bassam. Ibn al-Muqqafa's biographical background serves as an illustrative metaphor for today's escalating bloodthirstiness in Iraq — once again a historical vortex for clashing civilisations on a multiplicity of levels, including the obvious tribal, religious and political parallels.
The novelist Doris Lessing notes in her introduction to Ramsay Wood's 1980 ""retelling"" of the first two of the five Panchatantra books, that

""... it is safe to say that most people in the West these days will not have heard of it, while they will certainly at the very least have heard of the Upanishads and the Vedas. Until comparatively recently, it was the other way around. Anyone with any claim to a literary education knew that the Fables of Bidpai or the Tales of Kalila and Dimna — these being the most commonly used titles with us — was a great Eastern classic. There were at least twenty English translations in the hundred years before 1888. Pondering on these facts leads to reflection on the fate of books, as chancy and unpredictable as that of people or nations.""

Key
A-T — Aarne–Thompson tale type index number.
Edge — Franklin Edgerton's 1924 reconstruction of the Sanskrit text of the original Panchatantra. Though scholars debate details of his text, its list of stories can be considered definitive. It is the basis of English translations by Edgerton himself (1924) and Patrick Olivelle (1997 & 2006). The content of 2 other important versions, the ""Southern"" Panchatantra and the Tantrākhyāyika are very similar to that of Edgerton's reconstruction.
Durg — Durgasimha's Kannada translation of c. 1031 CE is one of the earliest extant translations into an Indian vernacular.
Soma — Somadeva's Kathasaritsagara (""Ocean of Streams of Story"") of 1070 is a massive collection of stories and legends, to which a version of the Panchatantra contributes roughly half of Book 10. The numbers given are those of N. M. Penzer, which situate the Panchatantra passages within the Kathasaritsagara as a whole. At the end of each of the Panchatantra's books, Somadeva (or his source) adds a number of unrelated stories, ""usually of the 'noodle' variety.""
Purn — Purnabhadra's recension of 1199 CE is one of the longest Sanskrit versions, and is the basis of both Arthur W. Ryder's English translation of 1925, and Chandra Rajan's of 1993.
Nara — Hitopadesha by Narayana is probably the most popular version in India, and was the second work ever translated from Sanskrit into English (by Charles Wilkins in 1787). The Hitopadesha itself exists in several versions, without an extant original. However, in this case the differences are comparatively trivial. Narayana split, combined, and reordered his source stories more extensively than most other revisers of the Panchatantra, so while cells in other columns generally have a one-to-one relationship, this does not hold true for the Hitopadesha.

Table
In addition to the stories listed below, many versions begin with a prelude in which a king bewails the stupidity of his sons, and the wise Vishnu Sharma (the Panchatantra's reputed author) bets that he can teach them statecraft in a mere 6 months; the tales constitute his lesson. (Of the versions tabulated below, only Somadeva's Kathasaritsagara lacks this ""master frame"" — an unsurprising omission, since the Panchatantra section is placed within the ""master frame"" of the Kathasaritsagara itself.)

It was compiled by Nadikerianda Chinnappa.,"The Pattole Palame is a compilation of Kodava folksongs first published in 1924. It was compiled by Nadikerianda Chinnappa.

Contents
The book is of 556 pages and divided into six sections. The first is called the Kodagu vivarane (Description of Kodagu) and consists of the first 76 pages. It speaks mainly of Kodagu's history, mythical and political, and geography. The second section (pages 73–202) is called Kodavara paddathi (Kodava customs) which speak of the ceremonies in the life of a Kodava from birth until death. Habbagalu (pages 203-298) is the name of the third section and it speaks of the Kodava festivals. The fourth section Devatheyada Pattu, gods' songs, from pages 269-403, consists of the songs of the village gods and goddesses. Goddess Kaveri, Seven Gods, Five Gods, Three Gods, Two Gods, Sarthavu (Aiyappa), Ketrappa (Kshetrapala), Pudiyodi (Bhagwathi) and others were the gods to whom these songs were dedicated. Keli Ponada Pattu (Songs of the well-known) forms the fifth section, pages from 404 to 502. It consists of ballads dedicated to Kanniyada Kamayya (also known as a folk song of Seven goddesses), Kaliatanda Ponnappa, Nadikerianda Devayya, Keyyondira Appayya, Aiyakovira Appayya and Poledevira Appayya, who were folk heroes of Kodagu. Naana Tharada Vishayagalu, from pages 503 to 556, forms the last section which consists of mainly sayings, proverbs and other matters.

Author
Nadikerianda Chinnappa and Appaneravanda Hardas Appachcha Kavi are the two important poets and writers of the Kodava language. Nadikerianda Chinnappa (1875–1931) was a Kodava Police Inspector in Coorg. He spent his leisure in travelling on horseback through the hills of Coorg. He got acquainted with several folk singers and thereafter he began to compile folk songs. Some prominent Kodavas reviewed his compilation (the Pattole Palome). In 1929 Chinnappa's translation of the Bhagwat Gita into Kodava thakk, called Bhagvathanda Patt got published. Chinnappa was also a well-known Kodava thakk poet.

Modern usage
In the past, the village elders knew the traditional laws by heart and passed it on orally over the generations. In recent times the Pattole Palame has acted as a reference for Kodavas who sought the ancient law. One known example was when a couple had to be divorced. The law court referred to the Pattole Palame where they read about the 'Kallu-mara Kaipa' tradition and decided to have them separated (Biddappa 1996: viii). The elders of Kodava couples who marry outside Kodagu or even abroad refer to the Pattole Palame in order to follow the customs faithfully.

Translation
Nadikerianda Chinnappa's grandchildren Boverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa translated the Pattole Palame into English. They say that ""It was when my parents visited us in Chennai in the 1960s that we learnt of how our grandfather had begun translating the work into English in 1925. But he died in 1931 before he could complete it. That is when both of us vowed to complete his translation one day"".

Plot
The story of Ponnar and Shankar begins with their grandparents.
The story of Ponnar and Shankar begins with their grandparents.
Their grandfather, Kolaththa Gounder,a Vettuva Gounder chieftain of the Vazhavanthi country in the Chera kingdom, along with his Kongu Vellalar concubine Ariyanaachi , sought refuge in Mathukkarai due to the injustices of his brothers. In a temple there, Kolaththa Gounder resolves a dispute between the Chera, Chola, and Pandya kings, earning him a sizable territory named Konadu. The couple establishes settlements in Konad, transforming the barren lands into prosperous farmlands through hard work and innovation. Konadu eventually becomes Valanadu, or Ponni Valanadu.

However, tragedy strikes when Kolaththa Gounder and Ariyanaachi pass away, leaving their illegitimate son Kunnudaiya Gounder orphaned. Kunnudaiya finds refuge with a kind merchant ,and he eventually falls in love with the merchant's beautiful daughter named Thaamarai Nachiyar, who initially does not reciprocate her feelings towards Kunnudaiya , but however on a particular full moon night he manages to confess his true feelings towards her and kisses her passionately and they both have intercourse under a Banyan tree while the merchant was away. Kunnudaiya later gets the merchant's consent and marries Thaamarai Naachiyar with whom he has two sons, Ponnar and Shankar and a daughter named Arkani.
The brothers grow up to become rulers of Ponni Valanaadu. Ponnar and Shankar, born amid adversity, emerge as formidable warriors reclaiming their rightful lands and avenging their parents' mistreatment. It is revealed that Shankar is impotent and cannot have progeny.
 
The brothers grow up to become rulers of Ponni Valanaadu. Ponnar and Shankar, born amid adversity, emerge as formidable warriors reclaiming their rightful lands and avenging their parents' mistreatment.
Their martial prowess and commitment to justice earn them respect, but also enemies, including the treacherous goldsmith SembaKulan. SembaKulan's deceit triggers a series of tragic events, culminating in a deadly battle at Padu Kalam and the suicides of Shankar and Sambuvan.
Devastated by loss, Ponnar seeks revenge against their adversary Kali, ultimately confronting and defeating him. However, the toll of the conflict proves too much to bear, leading Ponnar to take his own life alongside his fallen kin.
In a miraculous turn, Arkani, their sister, receives divine intervention from the goddess Peria Kandiamman, who revives Ponnar, Shankar, and Sambuvan. Though it seems the family has perished, legends suggest Ponnar may have survived, continuing his rule with the aid of the Chola king , but finally it is Kali who has the final hand and defeats Ponnar and Shankar and usurps their kingdom.

Legacy
Temples across Kongu Nadu honor the bravery and sacrifice of Ponnar and Shankar.
The legend of Ponnar and Shankar not only survives through tales passed down orally but has also been immortalized in various literary works, plays, and cultural performances across Tamil Nadu. Their story serves as a symbol of courage, resilience, and the eternal struggle for justice.
Throughout Kongu Nadu, their names evoke reverence and admiration, with festivals dedicated to their honor drawing crowds from far and wide. Temples dedicated to Ponnar and Shankar stand as enduring monuments to their valor, where devotees seek blessings and solace.
Moreover, the tale of Ponnar and Shankar has transcended regional boundaries, capturing the imagination of people beyond Tamil Nadu. Scholars and historians have studied their story, analyzing its cultural significance and impact on society.
In contemporary times, adaptations of the Ponnar-Sankar saga continue to captivate audiences through various mediums such as cinema and television, further cementing their place in popular culture.

As Europeans became aware of the Mongols and their empire, accounts placed the king in Central Asia, and eventually Portuguese explorers came to believe that the term was a reference to Ethiopia, by which time it had been an isolated Christian ""exclave"" distant from any other Christian-ruled territory.

Origin of the legend
Though its immediate genesis is unclear, officially the origin of the legend of Prester John originates from a letter that the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos received in 1165. The sender was: ""John, Christian Sovereign and Lord of Lords"".
The letter described the very rich lands of this monarch located in central Asia. The king said he lived in an immense palace made of gems and gold and said he governed a huge territory extending from Persia to China. For many years the myth of Prester John was associated with the dream of reaching a sumptuous kingdom, where all material pleasures were fulfilled and people lived in opulence.
The legend of Prester John drew strongly from earlier accounts of the Orient and of Westerners' travels there. Particularly influential were the stories of Saint Thomas the Apostle's proselytizing in India, recorded especially in the third-century work known as the Acts of Thomas. This text inculcated in Westerners an image of India as a place of exotic wonders and offered the earliest description of Saint Thomas establishing a Christian sect there, motifs that loomed large over later accounts of Prester John.
Similarly, distorted reports of movements in Asia of the Church of the East (Nestorianism) informed the legend as well. This church had gained a wide following in the Eastern nations and engaged the Western imagination as an assemblage both exotic and familiarly Christian. Particularly inspiring were the Church of the East's missionary successes among the Mongols and Turks of Central Asia; French historian René Grousset suggests that the Prester John story may have had its origins in the Kerait clan, which had thousands of its members join the Church of the East shortly after the year 1000. By the 12th century, the Kerait rulers were still following a custom of bearing Christian names, which may have fueled the legend.

Additionally, the tradition may have drawn from the shadowy early Christian figure John the Presbyter of Syria, whose existence is first inferred by the ecclesiastical historian and bishop Eusebius of Caesarea based on his reading of earlier church fathers. This man, said in one document to be the author of two of the Epistles of John, was supposed to have been the teacher of the martyr bishop Papias, who had in turn taught Irenaeus. However, little links this figure, supposedly active in the late first century, to the Prester John legend beyond the name. The title ""Prester"" is an adaptation of the Greek word ""πρεσβύτερος, presbiteros"", literally meaning ""elder"" and used as a title of priests holding a high office (indeed, presbyter is the origin of the English word priest).
Later accounts of Prester John borrowed heavily from literary texts concerning the East, including the great body of ancient and medieval geographical and travel literature. Details were often lifted from literary and pseudohistorical accounts, such as the tale of Sinbad the Sailor. The Alexander Romance, a fabulous account of Alexander the Great's conquests, was especially influential in this regard.
The Prester John legend as such began in the early 12th century, with reports of visits of an archbishop of India to Constantinople, and of a Patriarch of India to Rome at the time of Pope Callixtus II. These visits, apparently from the Saint Thomas Christians of India, cannot be confirmed, evidence of both being secondhand reports. What is certain is that German chronicler Otto of Freising reported in his Chronicon of 1145 that the previous year he had met Hugh, bishop of Jabala in Syria, at the court of Pope Eugene III in Viterbo. 
Hugh was an emissary of Prince Raymond of Antioch, sent to seek Western aid against the Saracens after the Siege of Edessa; his counsel inspired Eugene to call for the Second Crusade. Hugh told Otto, in the presence of the pope, that Prester John, a Nestorian Christian who served in the dual position of priest and king, had regained the city of Ecbatana from the brother monarchs of Media and Persia, the Samiardi, in a great battle ""not many years ago"". Afterwards Prester John allegedly set out for Jerusalem to rescue the Holy Land, but the swollen waters of the Tigris compelled him to return to his own country. His fabulous wealth was demonstrated by his emerald scepter; his holiness by his descent from the Three Magi.
Robert Silverberg connects this account with historic events of 1141, when the Qara Khitai khanate under Yelü Dashi defeated the Seljuk Turks in the Battle of Qatwan, near Samarkand. The Seljuks ruled over Persia at the time and were the most powerful force in the Muslim world; the defeat at Samarkand weakened them substantially. The Qara Khitai at the time were Buddhists, not Christians, and there is no reason to suppose Yelü Dashi was ever called Prester John. However, several vassals of the Qara Khitai practiced Nestorian Christianity, which may have contributed to the legend. It is also possible that the Europeans, who were unfamiliar with Buddhism, assumed that if the leader was not Muslim, he must be Christian. The defeat encouraged the Crusaders and inspired a notion of deliverance from the East. It is possible Otto recorded Hugh's confused report to prevent complacency in the Crusade's European backers – according to his account, no help could be expected from a powerful Eastern king.

Letter of Prester John
No more of the tale is recorded until about 1165, when copies of what was likely a forged Letter of Prester John started spreading throughout Europe. An epistolary wonder tale with parallels suggesting its author knew the Romance of Alexander and the above-mentioned Acts of Thomas, the Letter was supposedly written to the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus by Prester John, descendant of one of the Three Magi and King of India. The many marvels of richness and magic it contained captured the imagination of Europeans, and it was translated into numerous languages, including Hebrew. It circulated in ever more embellished form for centuries in manuscripts, examples of which still exist. The invention of printing perpetuated the letter's popularity in printed form; it was still current in popular culture during the period of European exploration. Part of the letter's essence was that a lost kingdom of Nestorian Christians still existed in the vastness of Central Asia.
The credence given to the reports was such that Pope Alexander III sent a letter to Prester John via his physician Philip on September 27, 1177. Nothing more is recorded of Philip, but it is most probable that he did not return with word from Prester John. The Letter continued to circulate, accruing more embellishments with each copy. In modern times, textual analysis of the letter's variant Hebrew versions has suggested an origin among the Jews of northern Italy or Languedoc: several Italian words remained in the Hebrew texts. At any rate, the Letter's author was most likely a Westerner.

Mongol Empire
In 1221, Jacques de Vitry, Bishop of Acre, returned from the disastrous Fifth Crusade with good news: King David of India, the son or grandson of Prester John, had mobilized his armies against the Saracens. He had already conquered Persia, then under the Khwarazmian Empire's control, and was moving on towards Baghdad as well. This descendant of the great king who had defeated the Seljuks in 1141 planned to reconquer and rebuild Jerusalem. 
Controversial Soviet historian and ethnologist Lev Gumilev speculated that the much reduced crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem in the Levant resuscitated this legend in order to raise Christian hopes and to persuade European monarchs who had lost interest by that time in getting involved in costly crusades, in a distant region that was far removed from their own states and affairs.  The bishop of Acre was correct in thinking that a great king had conquered Persia; however ""King David"", as it turned out, was the Tengrist Mongol ruler, Genghis Khan.
The Mongol Empire's rise gave Western Christians the opportunity to visit lands that they had never seen before, and they set out in large numbers along the empire's secure roads. Belief that a lost Nestorian kingdom existed in the east, or that the Crusader states' salvation depended on an alliance with an Eastern monarch, was one reason for the numerous Christian ambassadors and missionaries sent to the Mongols. These include Franciscan explorers Giovanni da Pian del Carpine in 1245 and William of Rubruck in 1253.
The link between Prester John and Genghis Khan was elaborated upon at this time, as the Prester became identified with Genghis' foster father, Toghrul, king of the Keraites, given the Jin title Ong Khan Toghrul. Fairly truthful chroniclers and explorers such as Marco Polo, Crusader-historian Jean de Joinville, and the Franciscan voyager Odoric of Pordenone: 244–247  stripped Prester John of much of his otherworldly veneer, portraying him as a more realistic earthly monarch. Odoric places John's land to the west of Cathay en route to Europe, and identifies its capital as ""Cosan"", variously interpreted by translators as a number of names and locations.: 245–246  Joinville describes Genghis Khan in his chronicle as a ""wise man"" who unites all the Tartar tribes and leads them to victory against their strongest enemy, Prester John.: 283–288  
William of Rubruck says a certain ""Vut"", lord of the Keraites and brother to the Nestorian King John, was defeated by the Mongols under Genghis Khan. Genghis Khan made off with Vut's daughter and married her to his son, and their union produced Möngke, the Khan at the time William wrote. According to Marco Polo's Travels, the war between the Prester and Genghis Khan started when Genghis Khan, new ruler of the rebellious Tartars, asked for the hand of Prester John's daughter in marriage. Angered that his lowly vassal would make such a request, Prester John denied him in no uncertain terms. In the war that followed, Genghis Khan triumphed, and Prester John perished.
The historical figure behind these accounts, Toghrul, was a Nestorian Christian monarch defeated by Genghis Khan. He had fostered the future Khan after the death of his father Yesugei and was one of his early allies, but the two had a falling-out. After Toghrul rejected a proposal to wed his son and daughter to Genghis Khan's children, the rift between them grew, until war broke out in 1203. Genghis Khan captured Sorghaghtani Beki, daughter of Toghrul's brother Jaqa Gambu, and married her to his son Tolui. They had several children, including Möngke, Kublai, Hulagu, and Ariq Böke.
The major characteristic of Prester John tales from this period is the king's portrayal not as an invincible hero, but merely one of many adversaries defeated by the Mongols. As the Mongol Empire collapsed, Europeans began to shift away from the idea that Prester John had ever really been a Central Asian king. At any rate they had little hope of finding him there, as travel in the region became dangerous without the security the empire had provided. In works such as The Travels of Sir John Mandeville and Historia Trium Regum by John of Hildesheim, Prester John's domain tends to regain its fantastic aspects and finds itself located not on the steppes of Central Asia, but back in India proper, or some other exotic locale. Wolfram von Eschenbach tied the history of Prester John to the Holy Grail legend in his poem Parzival, in which the Prester is the son of the Grail maiden and the Saracen knight Feirefiz.
A theory was put forward by the Russian scholar Ph. Bruun in 1876, who suggested that Prester John might be found among the kings of Georgia, which, at the time of Crusades, experienced military resurgence challenging the Muslim power. However, this theory, though regarded with certain indulgence by Henry Yule and some modern Georgian historians, was summarily dismissed by Friedrich Zarncke.: 184  The connection with Georgia is unlikely, considering that country was Orthodox, rather than Nestorian, and due to the fact that it and its predecessor states Colchis/Lazica and Iberia were well known and documented at the time, with Episcopoi of Kartli having regular epistolary conversions with Bishops of Rome.

Ethiopia
Prester John had been considered the ruler of India since the legend's beginnings, but ""India"" was a vague concept to the medieval Europeans. Writers often spoke of the ""Three Indias"", and lacking any real knowledge of the Indian Ocean they sometimes considered Ethiopia one of the three. Westerners knew that Ethiopia was a powerful Christian nation, but contact had been sporadic since the rise of Islam. No Prester John was to be found in Asia, so Europeans began to suggest that the legend was a reference to the Christian kingdom of Ethiopia. Evidence has suggested that locating Prester John's kingdom in Ethiopia entered the collective consciousness around 1250.
Marco Polo had discussed Ethiopia as a magnificent Christian land and Orthodox Christians had a legend that the nation would one day rise up and invade Arabia, but they did not place Prester John there. In 1306, 30 Ethiopian ambassadors from Emperor Wedem Arad came to Europe, and Prester John was mentioned as the patriarch of their church in a record of their visit. Another description of an African Prester John is in the Mirabilia Descripta of Dominican missionary Jordanus, around 1329. In discussing the ""Third India"", Jordanus records a number of fanciful stories about the land and its king, whom he says Europeans call Prester John.

After this point, an African location became increasingly popular. This may have resulted from increasing ties between Europe and Africa as 1428 saw the Kings of Aragon and Ethiopia actively negotiating the possibility of a strategic marriage between the two kingdoms. On 7 May 1487, two Portuguese envoys, Pêro da Covilhã and Afonso de Paiva, were sent traveling secretly overland to gather information on a possible sea route to India, but also to inquire about Prester John. Covilhã managed to reach Ethiopia. Although well received, he was forbidden to depart. Contact for the purpose of finding allies, such as with Prester John increasingly fueled early European exploration and colonialism. 
More envoys were sent in 1507, after the island of Socotra was taken by the Portuguese. As a result of this mission, and facing Muslim expansion, regent queen Eleni of Ethiopia sent ambassador Mateus to king Manuel I of Portugal and to the pope, in search of a coalition. Mateus reached Portugal via Goa, having returned with a Portuguese embassy, along with priest Francisco Álvares in 1520. Francisco Álvares's book, which included the testimony of Covilhã, the Verdadeira Informação das Terras do Preste João das Indias (""A True Relation of the Lands of Prester John of the Indies"") was the first direct account of Ethiopia, greatly increasing European knowledge at the time, as it was presented to the pope, published and quoted by Giovanni Battista Ramusio.
By the time Emperor Lebna Dengel and the Portuguese had established diplomatic contact with each other in 1520, Prester John was the name by which Europeans knew the Emperor of Ethiopia. The Ethiopians, though, had never called their emperor that. When ambassadors from Emperor Zara Yaqob attended the Council of Florence in 1441, they were confused when Roman Catholic-led council prelates insisted that the Ethiopians should refer to themselves as representatives of their monarch Prester John. They tried to explain that nowhere in Zara Yaqob's list of regnal names did that title occur. However, their admonitions did little to stop Europeans from calling the King of Ethiopia Prester John. Some writers who used the title did understand it was not an indigenous honorific; for instance Jordanus seems to use it simply because his readers would have been familiar with it, not because he thought it authentic.
Ethiopia has been claimed for many years as the origin of the Prester John legend, but most modern experts believe that the legend was simply adapted to fit that nation in the same fashion that it had been projected upon Ong Khan and Central Asia during the 13th century. Modern scholars find nothing about Prester John or his country in the early material that would make Ethiopia a more suitable identification than any place else, and furthermore, specialists in Ethiopian history have effectively demonstrated that the story was not widely known there until the Portuguese began to circumnavigate around Africa, which is how they reached Ethiopia, via the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. Czech Franciscan Remedius Prutky asked Emperor Iyasu II about this identification in 1751, and Prutky states that the man was ""astonished, and told me that the kings of Abyssinia had never been accustomed to call themselves by this name."" In a footnote to this passage, Richard Pankhurst states that this is apparently the first recorded statement by an Ethiopian monarch about this tale, and they were likely unaware of the title until Prutky's inquiry.

The Americas
The Italian historian Peter Martyr d'Anghiera identified the land of Prester John with Chicora in his Decades of the New World. 
Francisco de Chicora, a native of what is now South Carolina, who was captured by Spaniards and taken to Spain by Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón, had told Anghiera that his land was ruled by priests.

End of the legend and cultural legacy
Seventeenth-century academics like German orientalist Hiob Ludolf demonstrated that there was no actual native connection between Prester John and the Ethiopian monarchs, and search for the fabled king gradually ceased. But the legend had affected several hundred years of European and world history, directly and indirectly, by encouraging Europe's explorers, missionaries, scholars, and treasure hunters.
The prospect of finding Prester John had long since vanished, but the tales continued to inspire through the 20th century. William Shakespeare's 1600 play Much Ado About Nothing contains an early modern reference to the legendary king, as does Tirso de Molina's El Burlador de Sevilla. In 1910, Scottish novelist and politician John Buchan used the legend in his sixth book, Prester John, to supplement a plot about a Zulu uprising in South Africa. This book is an archetypal example of the early 20th-century adventure novel, and proved very popular in its day.
Throughout the rest of the century, Prester John appeared sporadically in pulp fiction and comics. For example, Marvel Comics has featured ""Prester John"" in issues of Fantastic Four and Thor. He was a significant supporting character in several issues of the DC Comics fantasy series Arak: Son of Thunder. Charles Williams, a member of the 20th-century literary group the Inklings, made Prester John a messianic protector of the Holy Grail in his 1930 novel War in Heaven. Prester John and his kingdom feature in two works by Umberto Eco. The first is the 2000 novel Baudolino, in which the titular protagonist enlists his friends to write the Letter of Prester John for his adoptive father Frederick Barbarossa, but it is stolen before they can send it out. The second is in Serendipities: Language and Lunacy (1998) on the chapter 'The Force of Falsity' where Eco pronounces that the letter from Prester John ""... served as an alibi for the expansion of the Christian world...""
In July 1986 issues, Avram Davidson published both a nonfiction essay, ""Postscript on Prester John"" in Asimov's Science Fiction (part of his ""Adventures in Unhistory"" series, and later republished in his 1993 book of that title), and a fantasy short story featuring Prester John's realm secretly still ruled by his descendant, ""The King Across the Mountains"" in Amazing Stories (later republished in The Adventures of Doctor Eszterhazy, 1990).
In 1988, Tad Williams's novel The Dragonbone Chair of his Memory, Sorrow and Thorn series would use the name Prester John as the name of the recently deceased High King of the fantasy world of Osten Ard.
He is also mentioned in the Vertigo imprint comic Fables.
The first single from American experimental pop band Animal Collective's 2022 album Time Skiffs is called ""Prester John"".

Heraldry
Various attributed arms have been given to Prester John.  The nave of Canterbury Cathedral, which is adorned with heraldic bosses, represents Prester John with Azure, the Saviour on the Cross or. In the 16th century, cartographer Abraham Ortelius produced a speculative map of John's empire in Africa, featuring A lion rampant facing to the sinister holding in its paws a quasi-Tau cross of full height.

Ascetic life
The son of King Maharatha, he became an ascetic and gained a few disciples.

Dilemma
On his walk with his closest disciple, he comes to the edge of a cliff, at the bottom of which is a starving tigress about to eat her newborn cubs in desperation. The bodhisattva tells his disciple to go look for food and he will stay and try to figure out a way to save her and her young.  While his disciple is gone, the bodhisattva reflects that while his disciple very well may not find food, his body is just so much flesh as the tradition states, and by giving it up, he can save the tigress' purity and her cubs' lives. He leaps off the cliff to his death, attracting the tigress' attention with his impact, and she eats his body.

Achievement and legacy
In this way, he comes closer to perfecting some of the ten Buddhist perfections: those of generosity, renunciation, morality, resolution and equanimity. His disciple returns, having not found food, and upon discovering what the bodhisattva has done, rejoices in his good deed. He comes back with other disciples and they and the heavens shower the spot with lotus flowers.

Stupa

The Chinese pilgrim Faxian reported one of the four great stupas of northern India that commemorates this incarnation's dehadana. This dehadana is known as ""gift of the body"" in Indian Buddhist narrative literature.

Other important components of Punjabi folklore are farces, anecdotes, idioms, folktales, and sayings.

Research
Origin
Richard Carnac Temple argued in his 1884 work, The Legends of the Punjab, that the plot structure of Punjabi folktales and bardic poetry was indistinguishable from one another, albeit with the bardic poems being more textually conservative (as they had been governed by metre and rhyme due to being in verse form). This led him to believe that the folktales originated from the bardic literature, existing as degraded derivatives.

I hope to show here abundantly that the bardic poem and the folktale are constructed on precisely the same lines as far as the pure story goes, even where the former is fastened on to really historical characters and mixed up with the narrative of bona fide historical facts [which Temple evidently values]. The folktale is very often in fact a mere scene, or jumble of scenes, to be found in the poem, where only the marvellous story has been remembered, while the names and surroundings of the actors to whom it is attributed has [sic] been forgotten. (Temple, v-vi)

Themes
Punjabi folktales commonly incorporate stories involving animals which teach a moral lesson. This is a theme which originated in ancient India, with a surviving example being the Panchatantra of the third century BCE. Other prevalent themes found within Punjabi folklore is a suspcision of those in positions of power, and folly & pretense used for derision.
The heroine in Punjabi folktales (a pari/fairy or a princess) can be found inside a fruit or vegetable, which they are named after, or in the form of an animal, such as a mammal (monkey or goat) or a bird (swan or peacock/peahen).

History of study
Academic folkloristic research into and the collecting of the large corpus of Punjabi folktales began during the colonial-era by Britishers, such as Flora Annie Steel's three papers on her studies of local Punjabi folktales (1880), with a translation of three fables into English, Richard Carnac Temple's The Legends of the Punjab (1884), Flora Annie Steel's Tales of the Punjab (1894), and Charles Frederick Usborne's Panjabi Lyrics and Proverbs (1905). Native Punjabis have also contributed to this field, with some names being Devendra Satyarthi, Mohinder Singh Randhawa, Amrita Pritam, Sohinder Singh Wanjara Bedi, Giani Gurdit Singh, and Sukhdev Madpuri, whom have contributed published collections, encyclopedias, anthologies, and renditions in this field of study.

Background
Puran was born to Queen Ichhira, the first wife of king Raja Sálbán. Upon the suggestion of the astrologers, Puran was sent away from the King for the first 12 years of his life. It was said that King could not see the face of his son. While Puran was away, the King married a young girl named Luna, who came from a low caste family. After 12 years of isolation, Puran returned to the royal palace. There, Luna became romantically attracted toward Puran, who was of the same age. Being the step-son of Luna, Puran disapproved of her advances. A hurt Luna accused Puran of violating her honor.
Puran was ordered to be amputated and killed. The soldiers cutoff his hands and legs and threw him in a well in the forest. One day Guru Gorakhnath were passing by with his followers and heard voice from the well. He took him out using a single thread and unbaked earthen pot. He was later adopted by Baba Gorkhnath. Puran himself became a yogi.

Worship
Puran also known as Baba Sahaj Nath Ji, is the supreme head of the Jandiyals, a Hindu caste. The Jandiyals gather twice a year on Guru Purnima and worship Puran Bhagat. The temple of Bawa Sahaj Nath Ji is located in Pakistan, but after partition, the Jandiyals constructed a temple in Jandi near Heeranagar, Jammu, and in Talab tillo (Jammu), another temple is in Taragarh near Dinanagar where Sharma's including Khajuria's gather twice year and a fourth one is in Dorangla.
Jandiyal families who came from Pakistan bought that temple's sand and used it to construct a small temple in Taragarh. People from all over India come here on Guru Purnima for Darshan.
In addition to the Targarh temple, Jandiyals (Mahajan) have built temples at Agra, Jammu, and Udhampur (J&K). Udhampur city is also known as Devika Nagri. The temple is located at Bypass Road, Fangyal. Jandiyal biradari celebrates and worships Baba Sehaj Nath ji twice a year on Budh Purnima and Kartik Purnima.

In popular culture
A number of Indian films have been made on the legend of Puran Bhagat. These include: Puran Bhagat (1928) by Pesi Karani, Puran Bhagat (1933) by Debaki Bose, Bhakta Puran (1949) by Chaturbhuj Doshi, Bhakta Puran (1952) by Dhirubhai Desai.
Loona (1965), is an epic verse play based on the legend of Puran Bhagat by Shiv Kumar Batalvi, now considered a masterpiece in modern Punjabi literature, and which also created a new genre, of modern Punjabi kissa. Though Loona is portrayed as a villain in the legend, Batalvi created the epic around her agony which caused her to become a villain. Batalvi became the youngest recipient of the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1967 for Loona.
Punjabi writer Puran Singh wrote a poem about Puran Bhagat.

Where Qisse reflect an Islamic and/or Persian heritage of transmitting popular tales of love, valour, honour and moral integrity amongst Muslims, they matured out of the bounds of religion into a more secular form when it reached India and added the existing pre-Islamic Punjabi culture and folklore to its entity.

Etymology
The word Qissa (pronounced Punjabi pronunciation: [kɪssɑː]) is an Arabic word meaning ""epic legend"" or a ""folk tale"". It occurs as a regular common noun in Indo-Aryan languages like Punjabi, Bengali, Gujarati, Urdu and Hindi. If used informally, the word means an ‘interesting tale’ or ‘fable’.

Qisse and the Punjabi culture
The Punjabi language has a rich literature of qisse, most of which are about love, passion, betrayal, sacrifice, social values and a common man's revolt against a larger system. In the Punjabi tradition, friendship, loyalty, love and qaul (verbal agreement or promise) are given utmost importance and most of the stories in the qisse hinge on these critical elements.
Qisse are attributed to have inspired folk music in Punjabi and have added depth and richness to its delivery. These traditions were passed down generations in oral or written forms and were often recited, told as bedtime stories to children or performed musically as folk songs.
Each qissa, if performed, has its unique requirements. A person able to sing or recite one may not necessarily transmit another. The vocal ranges of the musical scale and accurate pauses, if not performed well, leave a performer breathless and unable to continue. Most of the beats used in modern Punjabi music (often misleadingly labelled Bhangra), originated from qissa tradition and recitations in old times. Qisse also boast to be among the best poetry every written in Punjabi.

Poetry based on Qisse
Waris Shah's (1722–1798) qissa of ‘Heer Ranjha’ (formally known as Qissa ‘Heer’) is among the most famous Qisse of all times. The effect of Qisse on Punjabi culture is so strong that even religious leaders and revolutionaries like Guru Gobind Singh and Baba Farid, etc., quoted famous Qissas in their messages. It will not be wrong to say that popularity and nearly divine status of Qisse in Punjabi actually inspired many generations of spiritual leaders and social activists to combine the message of God with teenage love tales. This gave rise to what is known as the Sufi movement in Punjab region.
The most popular writer/poet to have written Punjabi Sufi Qisse was Bulleh Shah (c.1680-1758). So popular are his Kalams (poems) that he is frequently quoted by young and old alike with same respect and on matters of both love and God. In recent times, South Asian singers have sported these folklores on their albums, for instance, the most famous folklore duo like Kuldeep Manak and Dev Tharike Wala wrote and sang about almost every Qissa, and recently, Rabbi by (Rabbi Shergill) contained ‘Bulla Ki Jaana Main Kaun’, translated in English as ‘I know not who I am’, written by Bulleh Shah. A few years back another singer, (Harbhajan Maan), a Canada-based Punjabi singer rejuvenated the story of ‘Mirza Sahiban’, a work by Peelu. Daim Iqbal Daim from Mandi Bahauddin District, Pakistan also wrote many qissas in Punjabi language like Laila Majnu, Mirza Sahiban, Sohni Mahiwal, Bilal Biti, etc. Daim got popularity by writing ""Shah Nama Karbla"" and ""Kambal Posh"".

Notable Qisse
Most of the Punjabi qisse were written by Muslim poets who wandered the land. The oldest were usually scripted in the Perso-Arabic script. Some of the most popular qisse are listed below.

‘Mirza Sahiba’ by Peelu
‘Heer Ranjha’ by Waris Shah

The soldiers carried out his orders and cutoff the Puran's hands and legs and threw him in a well in the forest named the Puran's Well. After several years Guru Gorakhnath, who was passing by with his followers, heard voice from the well. He took him out using a single thread and unbaked earthen pot. He was later adopted by Baba Gorkhnath, and himself became a jogi.
Eventually, he confronted his father, and it was due to the ascetic's blessings that the king had another son who eventually became Raja Rasalu, another folk legend that became popular in Punjab.

Claims of descent
Various historical figures have claimed descent from Salban. Rao Bhati, the common ancestor of the Bhati Rajputs claimed descent from Salban and so did Bhati's descendant, Jaisal Singh, the founder and first monarch of Jaisalmer. Other claims of descent from Salban, via Jaisal Singh's lineage, include the Punjabi Phulkian dynasty.

She is mentioned in the bardic tragic romance representing the battle between Chudasama king  Khengara and Chaulukya king Jayasimha Siddharaja. However, this legend is not credible.","Ranakadevi was a legendary 12th century queen of Khengara, the Chudasama ruler of Saurashtra region of western India. She is mentioned in the bardic tragic romance representing the battle between Chudasama king  Khengara and Chaulukya king Jayasimha Siddharaja. However, this legend is not credible.

Legend of Ranakadevi
Ranakadevi was a daughter of potter of Majevadi village near Junagadh, the Chudasama capital. The fame of her beauty reached Jayasimha, and he made up his mind to marry her. Khengara's marriage with her enraged Jayasimha. A variation of legend tells that she was born to the king of Kutch but she was abandoned in forest as the astrologer had predicted that whoever marry her will lose his kingdom and die young. The abandoned child was found a potter named Hadmat or Jam Rawal who raised her as his own daughter. Meanwhile Khengara had attacked and broken gates of Jayasimha's capital Anahilapataka (now Patan) when he was on an expedition to Malwa which had further enraged Jayasimha.
Khengara used to stay himself at the fort of Uparkot in Junagadh but kept his queen Ranakadevi in his palace in the hill fort of Girnar, a mountain near Junagadh. His nephews Visal and Desal were the only persons allowed access there except the guard. Khengara used to go from the Uparkot to the Girnar fort to visit Ranakadevi. One day he found Desal drunk there and, in spite of all his protestations, accused him of an improper intimacy with her. Then he expelled both Desal and Visal from the Junagadh.
They went to Jayasimha and told him to attack Junagadh. They entered the Uparkot with some cattle carrying grain, slew the guards and attacked the palace. Khengara came forth and fought and died in the battle and the Uparkot was taken. After this Desal and Visal took Jayasimha up to the Girnar fort and asked their aunt queen Ranakadevi to open the gate. She did so, not knowing what had happened. Then Jayasimha entered and on seeing her two sons ordered them to be put to death. Jayasimha took Ranakadevi with him and returned towards Anahilapataka.
On their way, at Vardhamanapura (now Wadhwan) on the banks of river Bhogavo, overcome by the noble bearing of Ranakadevi, he offered to make her his first queen, but she told him that nothing would make her forgive him the death of her innocent boys and his husband. She then cursed Jayasimha and warned him that he should die childless. Then, she committed sati by burning herself on the funeral pyre of her husband, with his turban in her lap. Her curse was fulfilled and Jayasimha died childless.

Historicity
Several Sorathas (couplets) uttered by Ranakadevi in the bardic accounts evokes sadness but their usefulness as the historical material is doubtful. Even the existence of Ranakadevi is doubtful. Ranakadevi is not mentioned in the Chaulukya era chronicles such as Puratana-prabandha-sangraha or Merutunga's Prabandha-Chintamani but instead they give name Sonaladevi and Sunaladevi respectively. The Apabhramsa verses uttered by Sonaladevi after the death of Khengara counts eleven and eight in them respectively.
Ranakadevi's paliya (memorial stone) and a shrine still stand on the southern banks of the Bhogavo river in Wadhwan, though Ranakdevi's Temple seems to have been built earlier, probably during the reign of Dharanivaraha of the Chhapa dynasty (last quarter of the 9th century).

In popular culture
Several variation of this legend are still popular in bards and peoples of Saurashtra. Some of the verses of the ballad of Khengara and Ranakadevi are very poetical. Many verses are given in the Ras Mala by Alexander Kinloch Forbes. One such verse is:

For shame murderous Girnar, Why were you not bent crooked; When died Ra Khengara, Thus wept Ranakadevi.
Ranakdevi (1883), a Gujarati novel written by Anantprasad Trikamlal Vaishnav, is based on her. Amar Chitra Katha has published a comic, Ranak Devi: The Story of a Great Queen of Saurashtra (1977, #452) based on the legend.
She is a character in Sadhara Jesang, a Vesha (play) of Bhavai, the folk theatre of Gujarat. Gadh Juno Girnar (1967) is a Gujarati play based on the legend. Two silent films about Ranakadevi are produced; one in 1923 directed by S. N. Patankar and another in 1930 produced by Chandulal Shah and directed by Nanubhai Vakil. The Gujarati film Ranakdevi (1946) starring Nirupa Roy and directed by V. M. Vyas was also produced. Another film Ranakdevi (1973) directed by Babubhai Mistry starred Tarala Mehta, Upendra Trivedi, Arvind Trivedi and Arvind Pandya in lead roles.

Folklore
Sahlesh saves Dalits from the feudal lords their women from the atrocities of the kings and their men. Dalit brides were frequently kidnapped and raped by the feudal lords and the kings, and Sahlesh is known for confronting and challenging these practices. The root word ""Sahlesh"" also stands for ""King of the mountains"", and it is believed that his empire extended to parts of Bihar.
Sahlesh was born in Mehsautha village in the Mithilanchal region into the Dusadh caste. This caste is known for valour and for theft and robbery. Sahlesh was a critic of these crimes as well as the feudal structure of society. Sahlesh had an egalitarian ideology who wanted to remove the ills of society like untouchability in favor of a society based on equality. 
Salesh created a large army with the help of forest dwellers. Mithilanchal during those times was a war-torn region facing invasions by Chinese and Mongols. His army of forest dwellers defeated them all. F. E. Pargiter says that the devastation of the Chinese Shan army was such that not a single man was left to take the message of their defeat back to China.
Anang Kusuma, also known as Dauna Malin, is a nun of the Mahayana sect of Buddhism and the beloved of king Sahlesh.

Rule of Sahlesh
It is believed that Sahlesh focused on local governance and created local bodies, where he listened to people's problems. He is said to have punished a Tantric named Chakranath for following inhumane practices such as Nagdasi. Every year two young girls were forced to breastfeed a venomous snake, which killed them. The people were fearful. Sahlesh ended this practice by defeating Chakranath with Anang Kusuma's help.

Commemoration
The Dusadh community over Uttar Pradesh and Bihar commemorate their folk heroes, including Sahlesh and Reshama-Chauharmal via festivals and singing. They installed statues and formed socio-political organizations.

Within its native range, it is primarily growing in seasonally dry tropical forests.
It is an important tree to multiple cultural traditions across the Indian subcontinent and beyond.
The flower of ashoka tree is the state flower of Indian state of Odisha.

Description
The ashoka is a rain-forest tree. Its original distribution was in the central areas of the Deccan plateau, as well as the middle section of the Western Ghats in the western coastal zone of the Indian subcontinent.
The ashoka is prized for its beautiful foliage and fragrant flowers. It is a handsome, small, erect evergreen tree, with deep green leaves growing in dense clusters.
Its flowering season is around February to April. The ashoka flowers come in heavy, lush bunches. They are bright orange-yellow in color, turning red before wilting.
As a wild tree, the ashoka is a vulnerable species. It is becoming rarer in its natural habitat, but isolated wild ashoka trees are still to be found in the foothills of the central and eastern Himalayas, in scattered locations of the northern plains of India as well as on the west coast of the subcontinent near Mumbai.
There are a few varieties of the ashoka tree. One variety is larger and highly spreading. The columnar varieties are common in cultivation.

Mythology and tradition
The ashoka tree is used as a traditional medicinal plant.
It is considered sacred throughout the Indian subcontinent, especially in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. This tree has many folklorical, religious and literary associations in the region. Highly valued as well for its handsome appearance and the color and abundance of its flowers, the ashoka tree is often found in royal palace compounds and gardens as well as close to temples throughout India. 
The ashoka tree is closely associated with the yakshi mythological beings. One of the recurring elements in Indian art, often found at gates of Buddhist and Hindu temples, is the sculpture of a yakshini with her foot on the trunk and her hands holding the branch of a flowering ashoka tree. As an artistic element, often the tree and the yakshi are subject to heavy stylization. Some authors hold that the young girl at the foot of this tree is based on an ancient tree deity related to fertility.
Yakshis under the ashoka tree were also important in early Buddhist monuments as a decorative element and are found in many ancient Buddhist archaeological sites. With the passing of the centuries the yakshi under the ashoka tree became a standard decorative element of Hindu Indian sculpture and was integrated into Indian temple architecture as salabhanjika, because there is often a confusion between the ashoka tree and the sal tree (Shorea robusta) in the ancient literature of the Indian subcontinent.
In Hinduism the ashoka is considered a sacred tree. Not counting a multitude of local traditions connected to it, the ashoka tree is worshipped in Chaitra, a month of the Hindu calendar. It is also associated with Kamadeva, the Hindu god of love, who included an ashoka blossom among the five flowers in his quiver, where ashoka represent seductive hypnosis. Hence, the ashoka tree is often mentioned in classical Indian religious and amorous poetry, having at least sixteen different names in Sanskrit referring to the tree or its flowers.
In Mahākāvya, or Indian epic poetry, the ashoka tree is mentioned in the Ramayana in reference to the Ashoka Vatika (garden of ashoka trees) where Hanuman first meets Sita.

Other trees called 'ashoka tree'
The ashoka tree is sometimes incorrectly known as Saraca indica. 
A popular tree known as ""false ashoka tree"" or even as ""ashoka tree"", Polyalthia longifolia, is cultivated to resemble the growth pattern of erect pillar-like Mediterranean cypress trees. It is a popular park and garden plant, much used in landscaping on the Indian subcontinent, known also as Devadaar or Debdaru. This tree can easily be distinguished by its simple leaves and very different flowers. Ashoka flowers are red (initially orange in color) while P. longifolia flowers are apple green in color.  Ashoka fruits look like broad beans containing multiple seeds while false ashoka fruits are small, spherical and contain only one seed.  Ashoka trees are small in height, while false ashoka is taller.

The Raja ordered that the child be put in a wooden box and thrown in the Sindhu Darya. A washerman of the Bhambore village found the wooden box and the child inside. The washerman believed the child was a blessing from God and took her home. As he had no children of his own, he decided to adopt her.

Sassui grew up to be as beautiful as the fairies of heaven. Stories of her beauty reached Punnu and he became desperate to meet Sassui. The handsome young Prince, therefore, travelled to Bhambore. He sent his clothes to Sassui's father (a washerman) so that he could catch a glimpse of Sassui. When he visited the washerman's house, they fell in love at first sight. Sassui's father was dispirited, hoping that Sassui would marry a washerman and no one else. He asked Punnhun to prove that he was worthy of Sassui by passing the test as a washerman. Punnhun agreed to prove his love. While washing, he tore all the clothes as, being a prince, he had never washed any clothes; he thus failed the agreement. But before he returned those clothes, he hid gold coins in the pockets of all the clothes, hoping this would keep the villagers quiet. The trick worked, and Sassui's father agreed to the marriage.

Punnhun's brothers
Punnhun's father and brothers were against his marriage to Sassui (Punnhun being a prince and she being a washerman's daughter) and so, for their father's sake, Punnhun's brothers travelled to Bhambore. First, they threatened Punnhun but when he didn't relent, they tried more devious methods. Punnhun was surprised to see his brothers supporting his marriage and on the first night, they pretended to enjoy and participate in the marriage celebrations and forced Punnhun to drink different types of wines. When he was intoxicated they carried him on a camel's back and returned to their hometown of Kech.

The lovers meet their end
When Sassui woke up the following morning, she realized that she was cheated by her brothers-in-law. She became mad with the grief of separation from her beloved and ran barefoot towards the town of Kech Makran. To reach it, she had to cross miles of desert. Alone, she continued her journey until her feet were blistered and her lips were parched from crying ""Punnhun, Punnhun!"". The journey was full of dangerous hazards. She was thirsty when she saw a shepherd coming out of a hut. He gave her some water to drink. Seeing her incredible beauty, he tried to force himself on Sassui. Sassui escaped and prayed to God to hide her. God listened to her prayers, the land shook and split and Sassui found herself buried in the valley of mountains. When Punnhun woke in Makran he could not stop himself from running back to Bhambore. On the way, he called out ""Sassui, Sassui!"" to which the shepherd told Punnhun the whole story. Punnhun also lamented the same prayer, the land shook and split again and he was also buried in the same mountain valley as Sassui. The legendary grave still exists in this valley. Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai sings this historic tale in his Sufi poetry as an example of eternal love and union with the divine. But according to the retold Punjabi tale by Hashim Shah, Sassui dies while crossing the desert.

Kech Makran
The Kech Makran is located along the Makran Coastal Highway in Baluchistan, Pakistan. The fort of Punnhun whose construction dates back to 6000-8000
BC is located there.

Tombs of Sassui Punnhun
Sassui and Punnhun's alleged graves are located near Lasbela, Balochistan, 45 miles west of Karachi.

Frame Narrative
The Sultan sends his son, the young Prince, to be educated away from the court in the seven liberal arts by Seven Wise Masters. On his return to court, his stepmother, the empress, attempts to seduce him. To avert danger he is bound over to a week's silence by Sindibad, leader of the Seven Wise Masters. During this time, the empress accuses him to her husband, and seeks to bring about his death by seven stories which she relates to the emperor; but her narrative is each time confuted by the Seven Wise Masters led by Sindibad. Finally the prince's lips are unsealed, the truth exposed, and the wicked empress is executed.
The frame narrative served as the flexible way to transmit tales to other listeners.

Origins
The cycle of stories, which appears in many European languages, is of Eastern origin. An analogous collection occurs in Sanskrit, attributed to the Indian philosopher Syntipas in the first century BC, though the Indian original is unknown. Other suggested origins are Persian (since the earliest surviving texts are in Persian) and Hebrew (a culture with similar tales, such as that of the biblical Joseph).

The Eastern Version
The Eastern version of the narrative, known as The Book of Sindibâd (Sindbād-nāmah or The Book of Seven Viziers), is presumed to have originated from a lost 8th century Arabic source by a writer known as Musa. and may be found in Syriac, Arabic, Persian, Greek, Hebrew, and Old Spanish.

Syriac
The Syriac Sindban is one of the oldest extant versions of the narrative.

Persian: Sindibad-nameh
There are three versions in Persian, including one in verse, and two in prose, dating from the late twelfth century to the late fourteenth century. One of the prose texts, by Nakhshabi, is the eighth night in hisTutinama story-cycle.

Arabic: The Book of the Seven Vizirs
While the surviving versions of the Seven Vizirs are dated later than many of the other texts in the Eastern tradition, earlier versions are presumed to have existed.

Greek: Syntipas
The Byzantine version of the text.

Old Spanish: Sendebar, or Libro de los Engaños
While there are version of the narrative in Old Spanish that adhere to the narrative patterns found in the Western or European traditions, Libro de Los Engaños is part of the Eastern tradition.

Hebrew: Mischle Sendebar
The Western Tradition
Hundreds of surviving European texts are known. These normally contain fifteen tales, one for each sage, seven from the stepmother, and one from the prince; though the framework is preserved, only four of the commonest European tales are also found in the Eastern version.

Dolopathos
Travelling from the east by way of Arabic, Persian, Syriac and Greek, the work was translated from Greek into Latin in the 12th century by Jean de Hauteseille (Joannes de Alta Silva), a monk of the abbey of Haute-Seille near Toul, with the title of Dolopathos (ed. Hermann Österley, Strassburg, 1873). This was translated into French about 1210 by a trouvère named Herbers as Li romans de Dolopathos.

The Seven Sages of Rome
Another French version, Roman des sept sages, was based on a different Latin original.
The German, English, French and Spanish chapbooks of the cycle are generally based on a Latin original differing from these. Three metrical romances probably based on the French, and dating from the 14th century, exist in English. The most important of these is The Sevyn Sages by John Rolland of Dalkeith edited for the Bannatyne Club (Edinburgh, 1837).

German: Sieben weise Meister
The German adaptions of the Seven Sages tradition can be divided into several verse and prose versions, most of which follow the latin Historia but sometimes change the order or selection of the embedded tales.
The oldest known German version of the Seven Sages, Dyopcletianus Leben by Hans von Bühel, dates back to 1412, whereas most of the surviving textual witnesses are from the 16th to the 18th century and often embedded into German adaptions of the Gesta Romanorum. Literary scholars have repeatedly emphasized the popularity of the Sieben weise Meister in the late Middle Ages and early modern period in contrast to its marginalization in modern literary historiography.

Literary legacy
The collection later supplied tales that circulated in both oral and written traditions. Giovanni Boccaccio used many of them for his famous work, the Decameron.
The Latin romance was frequently printed in the 15th century, and Wynkyn de Worde printed an English version about 1515. See:

Gaston Paris, Deux rédactions du ""Roman des sept sages de Rome"" (Paris, Société des anciens textes français, 1876)
Georg Büchner, Historia septem sapientium (Erlangen, 1889)
Killis Campbell, A Study of the Romance of the Seven Sages with special reference to the middle English versions (Baltimore, 1898)
Domenico Comparetti, Researches respecting the Book of Sindibdd (Folk-Lore Soc., 1882).
The Seven Sages Society, founded in 1975, maintains a perpetual scholarly bibliography, with annual updates in its on-line and printed (free of charge) newsletter.

Stories
The tale collection has been thought to contain the origins of the Aarne–Thompson–Uther tale type ATU 671, ""The Three Languages"". The story tells of a commoner boy who can understand the language of animals, which converse among themselves that the boy will lord over their mother and father in the future. His parents expel him for such affront. After a series of adventures, the boy becomes a king or pope and returns to his family's house. His parents serve him with a water and a towel and he reveals his identity.

Attributed to king Bhoja, it has been partially recovered from a fragmentary manuscript. It contains a frame story, in which a courtesan's mother instructs her daughter on how to deal with men of various characters, through 13 sub-stories.

Manuscript
Shringara-manjari-katha is known from a fragmentary palm-leaf manuscript found at the Jaisalmer Jnana Bhandara (or Brihad-Jnana-Kosha), a Jain repository. The manuscript is written in Devanagari script in black ink, and the characters indicate use of a reed pen. Based on the page numbers, it appears that the complete text was written on 158 leaves, each measuring 11.7 x 2 inches. Out of these, 16 leaves are missing and 26 leaves are fragmented. The leaves are divided into two pages, with string holes in the centre. Generally, there are six lines on a page, but some narrow leaves have only five lines. The lines are written on both sides of the leaves, and each line contains 52-55 letters.
The scribe appears to have been well-versed with the writing technique, but not with the language. He made several grammatical and other textual mistakes, which may have resulted from carelessness or a defective source manuscript. The scribe has corrected a small number of errors by altering, canceling, or inserting letters. For example, an altered letter is indicated by two minor strokes.
The manuscript has a sentence mentioning the date of composition in the Shaka era, but the portion that mentions the date is lost. Other manuscripts with same handwriting were discovered in the same collection, but they are also undated. The style of writing matches with the style used in other manuscripts dated to 11th and 12th centuries. Based on this, and the condition of the leaves, the manuscript can be dated to 12th century or earlier.

Critical edition
In 1874, Indologist Georg Bühler noticed the manuscript, and described it in a short paragraph. In 1916, C. D. Dalal listed it in his Catalogue Of Manuscripts in the Jesalmere Bhandaras. In 1941, M. Krishnamachariar attempted to obtain the manuscript, but the Dewan of the Jaisalmer State replied that the manuscript had several missing and unnumbered pages, and some of its pages were mixed with another manuscript.
In 1942, Jain scholar Muni Jinvijay spent five months in Jaisalmer to examine various manuscripts. He found 15-20 palm leaves in the Shringara-manjari-katha manuscript, and had them copied. Later, he found several palm leaves in same handwriting while checking other manuscripts. He consolidated all the surviving palm leaves belonging to the Shringara-manjari-katha manuscript.
In 1945, Jinvijay asked his Ph.D. student Kalpalata Munshi to work on a critical edition of the text. Munshi's edition and translation was published in 1959, by the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. She corrected several scribal mistakes, and added punctuation and paragraphs for easier reading. She did not translate the small fragments, and the twelfth story, which is lost.

Authorship
The text names the Paramara king Bhoja (r.c. 1010–1055 CE) as its author. The first four stanzas of the work pay homage to Sarasvati, and the fifth stanza mentions Bhoja-raja as the author. The concluding verse again names Maharajadhiraja Parameshvara Shri (royal title) Bhoja-deva as the author. The colophon of each story in the book also names Bhoja as its author. The story is set in Bhoja's capital, Dhara, and greatly praises the city.
Bhoja was known as a patron of scholars and poets, and according to some scholars, several works attributed to him were actually written by his courtiers. Kalpalata Munshi asserts that Shringara-manjari-katha was authored by Bhoja himself. According to her, the text aims to illustrate the various types of rāga (attachment) presented in the Shringara-Prakasha, another work attributed to Bhoja. The title of the text (and the name of its heroine) appears to have some connection with Bhoja's theory of Shringara rasa, which is also presented in the Shringara-Prakasha. Historian Daud Ali (2016) believes that the text was most likely composed by a courtier of Bhoja.

Contents
King Bhoja and his companions are sitting in his palace garden, in his capital Dhara. At the request of his courtiers, Bhoja starts telling a frame story set in Dhara. He first glorifies Dhara as a great city, and then turns to a mechanical doll (yantra-putraka), commanding it to speak. The doll begins to speak, and glorifies Bhoja.
Bhoja then resumes his story, describing his favourite courtesan (ganika) Shringara-manjari as a beautiful, educated, and talented woman. The king describes her mother Vishama-shila as an old, unattractive, and deceptive woman having the skills required to manage courtesans.
Then, the actual frame story begins: Vishama-shila is concerned that one day her daughter Shringara-manjari may be cheated by rogue men, and therefore, educates her about the character of different types of men, by telling her thirteen short stories.

The tale of Ravi-datta
Ravi-datta was born in a Brahmin family of Kundinapura, and mastered all the Vedas and the shastras by the age of 16 years. His father Soma-datta instructed him on several topics, including that of prostitutes. After the death of his parents, his friends convinced him to attend the festive procession of the god of love (Madana). Although this was against what his parents had taught him, Ravi-datta attended the event, and became infatuated with a courtesan named Vinaya-vati.
Vinaya-vati recognized him as an easy prey, and invited him home through her friend Sangamika. Ravi-datta was initially apprehensive, but ultimately agreed. He started visiting her everyday, and gradually, lost all his wealth to her. When Ravi-datta had no more money left, she sent a message to him through Sangamika, asking him to not visit her for a few days, as she would be with a wealthy merchant named Vasu-datta.
After some days, Ravi-datta visited Vinaya-vati's house, but her servants refused to let him in. He met Sangamika, but she refused to recognize him. He made repeated attempts to meet Vinaya-vati, but each time, her servants ridiculed him, and turned him away. Despite this, Ravi-datta's attachment for Vinaya-vati did not decrease. He kept thinking about her for the rest of his life, and considered himself lucky whenever he had an opportunity to look at her.
Vishama-shila explains that Ravi-datta's attachment like was like indigo. Just like a cloth dyed in indigo does not lose its colour even after being washed several times, a man with this character does not give up his attachment even after being ruined. She declares that the secret teachings of prostitution yielded good results once the nature of such men was known.

The tale of Vikrama-simha
One day, Prince Vikrama-simha of Tamalipti, was roaming around in the locality of courtesans. There, he saw Malatika, the daughter of the procurer Ekadamshtra. He was attracted to Malatika, and asked his servant Priyamvadaka to arrange a meeting with her. Malatika said that her livelihood depended on a merchant named Vasu-datta because of a contract, and Vikrama-simha will have to wait until she could find an excuse to meet him.
Vikrama-simha waited patiently for the entire rainy season. One day, Malatika sent her messenger Madhukarika to invite him to her place. He visited her, and once gratified, gave her much wealth before leaving. The next portion is lost, but the subsequent text suggests that Vikrama-simha felt offended for some reason. He stopped visiting Malatika, stopped sending her gifts, and his attachment for her gradually decreased.
Vishama-simha explains that Vikrama-simha's attachment was like rubia cordifolia root (mañjiṣṭhā). Just like a cloth dyed in it gradually fades in colour when washed, such a man gradually loses his attachment when offended. Therefore, a courtesan should not offend such men.

The tale of Madhava
A procurer named Bhujanga-vagura lived in the city of Vidisha. Her daughter Kuvalayavali was a beautiful young woman. One day, Madhava - a wealthy man and a student of the Vedas - returned to Vidisha from Simhala-dvipa. He learned of Kuvalayavali's beauty, and paid much money to spend a night with her. Kuvalayavali was pleased with him and started inviting him often. Gradually, she deprived him of all his wealth.
To avoid being seen as a ruined man, Madhava decided to leave Vidisha and go to Malaya country to earn wealth. Kuvalayavali cried and tried to stop him. Madhava refused to stay, but before leaving, gifted her his expensive upper garment. Kuvalayavali and her mother Bhujanga-vagura followed him for some distance, and then the mother asked him to give Kuvalayavali a token of remembrance. When Madhava said that he did not have anything left, she suggested that he give her the clothes remaining on his body. Madhava agreed, but said that he was feeling shy because there were many travelers on the road. He asked the women to follow him to a lonely spot where he could remove his clothes and give them to Kuvalayavali. When they reached a lonely spot, Madhava attacked Bhujanga-vagura: he threw her on the ground, and cut her nose and ears. He declared that this was a token of remembrance that she would never forget, and then left.
Vishama-shila explains that Madhava's attachment was like safflower (kusumbha). Just like a cloth dyed in safflower is not suitable for washing or exposing to heat, a man with this character becomes estranged and evil when offended. Therefore, a courtesan should take the wealth of such a man without offending him.

The tale of Sura-dharman
A poor man named Sura-dharman lived in the Hastigrama village of Brahmins, located on the banks of the Ganges river. He obtained a precious jewel by worshipping the deity of the sea. He was concerned about losing the jewel, so he cut open his thigh, and hid it there. To avoid being seen as the owner of a precious jewel, he started feigning madness, and wandered around, saying only the words ""Mother knows"".
After several days, Sura-dharman came to Ujjayini, the capital of king Vikramaditya. The king's courtesan Deva-datta was always looking for rich men to fleece. One day, she came across Sura-dharman and realized that he must be feigning madness to hide something precious. She brought him home, and made several attempts to find his secret, at the cost of neglecting the king. However, even after six months, Sura-dharman did not say anything except ""Mother knows"".
One day, Sura-dharman decided to leave, concerned that Deva-datta will be able to find his secret if he stayed any longer. Deva-datta threatened to immolate herself, but still failed to stop him from leaving. Deva-datta took this as a personal defeat, and decided to make a final attempt to stop him by faking her death.
Following Deva-datta's plan, two girls met on the road where Sura-dharman was walking. One girl informed the other that Deva-datta had fallen in love with a madman, and died after he left her. When Sura-dharman heard this, he told the girls that he was the person responsible for her death, and ran back to her house. At the house, Deva-datta played dead, surrounded by other people. The procurer cried and rebuked Sura-dharman for destroying their happiness. Feeling sorry, Sura-dharman gave the jewel to the procurer, and decided to commit suicide to be with Deva-datta. Just then, Deva-datta opened her eyes, and a rumour spread that she had miraculously risen from dead when her lover came to her. Sura-dharman lived happily with Deva-datta for some days, but then, she kicked him out.
Vishama-shila explains that Sura-dharman's attachment was like turmeric powder (haridrā). Just like a cloth dyed in turmeric fades in the heat of the sun, a man with this character becomes averse by threats. Therefore, a courtesan should resort to other, extraordinary means to take his wealth.

The tale of Deva-datta
One day, king Vikramaditya of Ujjayini asked his courtesan Deva-datta how courtesans acquire a man's wealth and how should a man deal with them. Deva-datta did not want to answer the question, and changed the topic of conversation by narrating a strange incident.
Deva-datta said that on the previous day, she saw a handsome man riding a wonderful horse on the palace grounds. The man invited her to mount the horse, and took her to a distant mansion on the flying horse. At the mansion, she saw a man with a whip and a beautiful, crying woman. Deva-datta was asked to act as a messenger of love between the two. When she declined, the man with the whip started beating her. Deva-datta started chanting that she served king Vikramaditya, the conqueror of the three worlds. The others felt the presence of the king, and fled in fear. Sometime later, Deva-datta found herself on the palace grounds.
The king repeatedly asked Deva-datta if this incident really happened, and she swore that it was true. Pleased with her, the king gifted her his second best elephant, 40 million pieces of gold, precious ornaments, and expensive clothes. Deva-datta smiled and said that she had just demonstrated how courtesans acquire a man's wealth. A pleased Vikramaditya doubled the gifts.
Vishama-shila told her daughter that one can acquire wealth by acting according to the others' desires, and that anything can be attained with flattery.

The tale of Lavanya-sundari
Vishama-shila remarks that for those who are willing to sacrifice themselves, it is not difficult to obtain a desire from great and valorous persons. She then narrates the following story.
A rich oilman named Ghuda and his beautiful wife Lavanya-sundari lived happily in the town of Ahichchhatra. One day, the local king Vajra-mukta saw Lavanya-sundari, and became infatuated with her. His spies told him that she was already married to Ghuda. So, he had Ghuda wrongfully arrested for adulteration of oil. Ghuda tried to secure his release by offering a large amount of money, but the king declared that he will be freed only if he is able to get a hundred elephants within six months.
Lavanya-sundari considered her husband's freedom more important than her own reputation, and decided to become a courtesan to secure the elephants from king Sahasanka of Ujjayini. She reached Ujjayini with a large retinue, took up a residence on the banks of the Shipra River, and spread the word that she was a rich and noble courtesan. When the king heard about her, he passed by her residence on the pretext of hunting. He was mesmerized by her beauty, and sent a man named Mukharaka to invite her to his palace.
Lavanya-sundari accepted the invitation, and started staying at the king's palace. The king's advisor Bhatta-matrgupta warned him not to trust a prostitute. However, Vikramaditya tested her many times, and she always proved loyal to him. Lavanya-sundari was afraid of Bhatta-matrgupta, but as the six-month deadline approached closer, she decided to take a step towards securing the elephants. She stormed into a room where the king and his advisor were sitting, and angrily rebuked the king for regarding her true love as prostitution. She then went to the bedroom, and beheaded herself using a dagger. The king was stunned, and angrily asked Bhatta-matrgupta if he considered this an act of a prostitute. Bhatta-matrgupta replied in affirmative, but the king disregarded him, and took the dead body to the temple of the goddess Ashapura. There, he announced that he would behead himself before the goddess. Pleased with his love and courage, the goddess revived Lavanya-sundari.
The king now fully trusted Lavanya-sundari. Some days later, he promised to fulfill any wish of hers. Initially, she declined to make a wish, but the king insisted. She then said that she had been fascinated with elephants since childhood, and wanted a hundred elephants. The king fulfilled her wish. After 2–3 days, she asked the king to free her, and narrated her story. The king allowed her to go back, and she spent the rest of her life happily with her husband Ghuda.

The tale of the cheating procurer
A Brahmin had two sons, named Vishnu-gupta and Soma-datta. When they grew up, they decided to visit another country. During the journey, they spent 7 days passing through the Vindhya forests, and ran out of food and water. They decided to rest and pass the night under a banyan tree beside a lake. They agreed to take turns to guard against wild animals at night.
During his turn, Soma-datta heard a pair of pigeons talking. The female pigeon suggested that they throw themselves in fire to provide food for the starving Brahmins. The male pigeon agreed, and spoke of a sage's prophecy: the person who ate the male pigeon would become a king, and the person who ate the female pigeon would get 500 pieces of gold every day. After the birds threw themselves into the fire, Soma-datta took them out, and woke up his brother. He told his brother about the prophecy: he ate the female pigeon, and gave the male pigeon to his brother.
In the morning, Soma-datta found 500 gold pieces by his side. Convinced that the prophecy was true, the brothers happily resumed their journey, and separated after some time. Vishnu-gupta, the elder brother, became the king of Magadha. Soma-datta came to the city of Kanchi, where a procurer named Makara-damshtra lived with her daughter Karpurika. Soma-datta spent time with Karpurika, and gave her large amounts of gold. Intrigued by his seemingly unlimited wealth, Makara-damshtra had her daughter find out his secret. She then fed Soma-datta an emetic to induce vomiting. When the female pigeon came out of his mouth, she ate it, and started getting 500 pieces of gold everyday. A regretful Soma-datta decided to leave.
While traveling, Soma-datta heard about the new king of Magadha, and deduced that the king must be his brother. He visited Magadha, obtained great wealth from his brother, and returned to Kanchi after a few days. When Karpurika asked him about his wealth, he replied that he had practiced penance at Shri-parvata to obtain a yogic power (siddhi) that allowed him to generate great wealth. A greedy Karpurika offered to exchange the pigeon for this power. Soma-datta agreed, and re-acquired his ability to get 500 pieces of gold. He returned to Magadha, while Karpurika was left disappointed.
Vishama-shila advises her daughter to never trouble rogue men, as they may take even previously earned wealth when irritated.

The tale of a woman's love
Vishama-shila says that the next story will demonstrate why a courtesan should never fall in love.
A rich man named Vasu-datta lived in the Pundra-vardhana town, with his only son Ratna-datta. Guided by his teacher Vasu-bhuti, Ratna-datta grew up to be a very knowledgeable man. He decided to work in the service of a powerful king instead of continuing his father's business. He declared that courtesans would invite him and not abandon him; if this did not happen, he would commit suicide. Accordingly, he set out to meet king Pratapa-mukuta of Manyakheta, accompanied by his servant Subandhu. He decided to earn his living on the way, but kept 1,000 pieces of gold in case of an emergency.
On their way to Manyakheta, Ratna-datta and Subandhu came to Vidisha, and attended a dance performance by the courtesan Lavanya-sundari at the temple of Bhailla-svami-deva-pura. The courtesan fell in love with Ratna-datta at first sight, and after the performance, sent her friend Bakulika to invite him home. Ratna-datta and Lavanya-sundari spent a night together, and she became so attached to him that she stopped thinking about all other men. However, he left in the morning and went to a gaming house. She sent Bakulika to invite him again, and that night, asked him about his future plans. When Ratna-datta said that he was going to Manyakheta, Lavanya-sundari decided to go with him, accompanied by a procurer.
Some days later, the travelers reached the town of Punyapathaka. The procurere wanted Lavanya-sundari to return to Vidisha, so she conspired to have Ratna-datta killed by portraying him as a kidnapper. The conspiracy proved to be unsuccessful, when the local king Sura-dharman realized that Lavanya-sundari was accompanying Ratna-datta willingly. The travelers continued their journey, and reached Manyakheta. Ratna-datta left their residence in search for a job, saying that he would return after four days. Meanwhile, the local king saw Lavanya-sundari, became enamoured by her, and invited her to his palace. Lavanya-sundari agreed on the condition that she would be allowed to leave whenever she wanted.
On the fourth day, Lavanya-sundari left the palace to welcome Ratna-datta back. The king was curious to see her lover, so, he came to their residence, and hid behind a latticed window. When Ratna-datta came, Lavanya-sundari prepared to wash his feet. Looking at her dress, Ratna-datta realized she had become the royal courtesan. He stopped her from washing his feet, and declared that she was like his mother now that she had become the king's partner. Pleased by Ratna-datta, the king invited him to the royal palace. Ratna-datta entered the royal service, started enjoying the king's favours, and forgot all about Lavanya-sundari.
Vishama-shila tells her daughter that women who become deeply attached to men destroy themselves and their wealth.

The tale of mutual love
King Samara-simha of Ugrapura had a courtesan named Ashoka-vati, who was an expert at sword-dancing. She was in love with the king's feudatory (samanta) Chaddalaka. On a winter day, the king asked her to perform a sword-dance in an assembly of his feudatories. Hoping that Chaddalaka would be present there, the courtesan put on her best dress, and promised to make an offering to the god if she saw Chaddalaka that day. On her way to the court, she saw the wish-fulfilling god Ganapati, and became very happy.
At the assembly, Ashoka-vati started her performance with great rhythm and grace. However, when she did not see Chaddalaka, her enthusiasm diminished, and she lost her grace. Worried that she would lose her balance and fall on the sword, her teacher requested the king to stop the performance. The king agreed, and rebuked Ashoka-vati. Ashoka-vati told the king the reason for her poor performance, and boldly declared her love for Chaddalaka, stating that she was ready to accept any punishment. The king did not punish her, but asked her not to be so bold again.
To the king's surprise, as soon as she left the court, she went straight to Chaddalaka's residence. He decided to cause a rift between the two lovers. On the king's instructions, a handsome young man named Sundaraka seduced her, and recorded evidence of their one-night stand using a pattanika. (The exact meaning of pattanika is not known: according to A.K. Warder, it was ""probably a fine cloth on which a print could be taken from a woman's body, reproducing her characteristic make up and even blood from love scratches"".)
Next day, Ashoka-vati regretted being unfaithful to Chaddalaka. Sundaraka felt dejected seeing that she was no longer interested in him, and gave the pattanika to the king. The king presented the evidence before Chaddalaka, but Chaddalaka dismissed it as a ploy to cause a rift between him and Ashoka-vati. Nevertheless, he decided to test Ashoka-vati's love for him. He asked his minister Tikkapaika to see her reaction on being informed that he had died in battle against the king of Kachchha. When Ashoka-vati heard the fake news, she died of shock. Sundaraka blamed himself for her death, and committed suicide by immolation. Chaddalaka also threw himself on a funeral pyre on the cremation ground.
The king felt sorry for having caused the deaths of three innocent people, and decided to behead himself before the goddess Ashapura. The goddess prevented him from doing so, and at his request, revived the three dead people. The king brought Ashoka-vati and Chaddalaka together, and made Sundaraka the lord of 4,000 villages.
Vishama-shila tells her daughter that many courtesans lose their wealth and their lives when they fall in love with men. Therefore, a courtesan should stay away from love like she stays away from a tiger.

The tale of the snake
A Brahmin named Shruta-dhara lived in the city of Kaushambi, and had a son named Vinaya-dhara. At the age of sixteen, the son completed his education, and attended a spring festival at the Kala-priya-deva temple. There, he saw a courtesan named Ananga-vati, started visiting her, and gradually lost all his wealth. Ananga-vati liked him, but the procurer did not approve of her fondness for a poor man. The procurer kicked Vinaya-dhara out of their place several times, but Vinaya-dhara and Ananga-vati continued to meet under various pretexts.
One day, Vinaya-dhara spotted a dead snake, and picked it up. He borrowed money from a friend, and gained admittance to Ananga-vati's place. At midnight, when everyone else was sleeping, he came to the room where the procurer's room. He threw the snake on the procurer's body, pinched her nose and lips to mimic a snakebite, and left quickly. The procurer woke up screaming, and her servants rushed to help her. Vinaya-dhara also came back with a stick, pretended to kill the snake, and said that something needed to be done about the stings on the procurer's body. The procurer asked her servants to cut off her nose and her lips to prevent the venom from spreading. In the morning, everyone congratulated Vinaya-dhara for saving the procurer's life, while she continued to squirm in pain.
Vishama-shila cautions her daughter that rogue men can do unpredictable things when harassed.

The tale of Malaya-sundari
Vishama-shila tells her daughter that no one should be insulted, because there is nothing that an insulted man would refrain from doing. She then narrates the following story.
Pratapa-simha, an ugly and passionate man, was a feudatory to the king Mahendra-pala of Kanyakubja. A procurer named Dhonda lived with her daughter Malaya-sundari in the same town. One day, Pratapa-sundara visited Malaya-sundari and spent the night with her. When he woke up next morning, he saw that a child was sleeping beside Malaya-sundari. The child was that of her sister, but when Pratapa-simha enquired, she teased him by saying that it was her own child.
Pratapa-simha lost his temper, and assaulted Malaya-sundari: he threw her on the ground, scratched her body like a tiger, and pulled her hair. Malaya-sundari was a favorite of king Mahendra-pala, and the procurer complained to the king. Pratapa-simha defended himself by saying that he had always tolerated her teasing, but became very angry when she said the child was hers. He said that the assault resulted from his extreme attachment to her. The king was pleased with explanation, and gave him presents, while Malaya-sundari became an object of ridicule.
Vishama-shila concludes that an insulted man would do anything to ridicule a woman.

The tale of Pamaraka
Vishama-shila says that one should not become the enemy of a crook (dhūrta) without a just cause. The actual story is lost, but at its end, Vishama-shila tells her daughter to never deceive a clever man, or be ready to bear the results.

The tale of Mula-deva
Vishama-shila explains that the attachment (rāga) may be born on hearing, seeing, or being with a partner. In all three cases, it should be abandoned, or it makes a woman an object of ridicule, even if she is from a good family.
A crook (dhūrta) named Mula-deva was very close to king Vikramaditya of Ujjayini. One day, the king asked him why he was still unmarried. Mula-deva replied that he did not marry because women are fickle in their love. The king said that women are the main source of happiness and the main support of a man's life, and convinced Mula-deva to get married.
After some time, Mula-deva discovered that his wife was having an affair with another man. He also found that Vikramaditya's chief queen Chella-mahadevi was having an affair with the royal elephant-driver, and visited him every night. In fact, one night the elephant-driver lashed her with a rope because she was late, but she was so attached to him that she pacified him by spending the night with him. The next day, Mula-deva proved to the king that their wives were unfaithful to them. The king punished both women, and imprisoned the queen after cutting off her nose and ears.
Vishama-shila tells her daughter that even courtesans of noble character and women from good families sometimes fall in love at first sight, without caring for their lives or wealth. Such attachment should be avoided.

Scholarly interest and analysis
Kalpalata Munshi describes Shringara-manjari-katha as a product of a decadent phase in Sanskrit literature, when the poets emphasized convention over creativity. Nevertheless, she praises the work for its ""rich contents, references, interests, and its uniqueness of form."" The text is useful as a source of information about the contemporary social life, customers, traditions, administration, architecture and geography.
Scholars have compared Shringara-manjari-katha to Damodara-gupta's Kuttanimata and Kshemendra's Samaya-matrika. All three works feature a procurer educating a courtesan on how to deal with men. However, Shringara-manjari-katha is written in prose and is more focused on story-telling. The other two are poems, and give more attention to kamashastra (the art of love-making).
Some of the motifs found in Shringara-manjari-katha also appear in other contemporary texts. For example, in the tale of Lavanya-sundari, the heroine gains the trust of king Vikramaditya, but the minister does not trust her. In the end, she asks the king for a favour to free her true lover, and the king obliges. A similar story appears in Somadeva's Kathasaritsagara (also from the 11th century): the courtesan Kumudika befriends king Vikramasimha, but the minister Ananga-tunga warns the king against her. When the king feigns his death to test her, she throws herself into his funeral pyre. Although the minister is still distrustful of her, the king now fully trusts her and asks her to make a wish. She then reveals that she is in love with someone else, and seeks the king's help in rescuing her imprisoned lover. Kshemendra's Kala-vilasa features the same story with minor changes.
The text has attracted scholarly attention for its mention of a garden with several mechanical devices, including a mechanical doll (yantra-putraka) located near a mechanical ""fountain house"" (yantra-dhārā-gṛha). While the doll is used as a literary device to praise Bhoja, what is notable is that the text also describes several other mechanical objects in the scene, including artificial trees, lotuses, ducks, monkeys, fish, herons, crocodiles, turtles, bees, and female attendants. These objects are said to have been built of expensive metals and gems. They are described as moving, making sounds, and spraying water. For example, the female attendants played lutes and drums, bathed, and sprayed water from their breasts and fingernails. Somadeva's Yashas-tilaka-champu, written in the previous century (959 CE), also describes such a mechanical garden with several moving objects, but the Shringara-manjari-katha is more detailed in its description and also adds sounds to the mechanical objects.

Tradition states that these tales were narrated by Buddha himself during his ministry in India to emphasise that by the constant practice of virtuous deeds one reaches the status of Nirvana or enlightenment.

The Story of King Sibi
Arvind Sharma describes the story of King Shibi in the following terms,

""As he sat in the court one day, a sparrow sought refuge in his lap, while being chased by a falcon. The falcon demanded the sparrow from the king as it constituted his means of subsistence. Accepting the falcon’s right, the king offered his own flesh in order to fulfill his duty of protecting his subjects.""

Variations
There are many versions of the Shibi Jataka and the one narrated above is also found in the Mahabharata as the story of a king called Shibi. Another version of the story of Shibi is narrated as follows:

""Indra came as a blind person to King Shibi and asked him to donate one of his eyes so that he could regain his sight partially. Sibi, however, offered both eyes for the complete restoration of the blind man's sight.  The ready willingness of king Sibi to sacrifice both his eyes moved Indra into revealing his true form and blessing the king.""
In the Chinese Buddhist tradition, the two versions of the story are attributed to two different kings. The king who sacrifices his eyes is called Kuai-mu Wang - the king with happy eyes.

Cave Paintings
The story is depicted in numerous Buddhist cave paintings. An example of this can be found in Cave 17 at Ajanta. This shows a man holding a set of scales while the king is engaged in cutting his flesh out. The panel also shows the king’s courtiers, and subjects rejoicing this noble act of their king. A painting in the Mogao Caves (Cave 275) shows a panel illustrating five jataka tales. The two versions of the Sibi legend are depicted in this panel.

Connections with the Chola Dynasty
The story of King Shibi has been linked with the South Indian dynasty of Cholas who ruled between c 100 C.E. to c. 1250 C.E. The later Cholas claimed to have descended from Shibi. The Tamil name for Shibi was Sembiyan. This name was assumed by many Chola kings.

Plot
King Bhoja walks past a field of a Brahmin with the royal entourage who from a seat on a high mound overlooking his whole field invites the King to have a taste of the fresh produce of his field. On the King's approach to the Brahmin's field, he leaves his seat to shoo off the birds, following which he miserly opposes King's entry on his field and charges him with grave intrusion and violation of civilian rights which prompts the King to leave the field immediately. After shooing off the birds, the Brahmin returns to sit on the mound. He then again beseeches King Bhoja to return to the field and taste the produce. Again the same process is repeated which intrigues Bhoja as to how the behavior of the Brahmin changes whilst on the mound and on the plain.
He learns that by just stepping on it, one's heart has all the magnanimous traits boosted and filled with love and justice. Bhoja's soldiers dig the mound to find a throne. The throne is identified as that of the ancient Emperor Vikramaditya, who was well-known and respected for being just. Bhoja's advisers tell him that he will also be able to pass the best judgements, once he sits on the throne.
The throne is supported by 32 statues of Apsaras. When Bhoja sits on the throne, one of the statues comes to life, and explains to the king that simply sitting on the throne will not make him a great judge: there are other qualities that he lacks. The Apsara tells him one story related to one quality that a good judge must possess and flies away. In the same manner, one after another, the Apsaras tell a story related to a quality and fly away. Bhoja realizes that he does not possess the qualities that would make one eligible to sit on the throne. Some of these qualities are selflessness, complete honesty, lack of bias or favouritism and a true urge to give justice.

Authorship and date
The author and date of the original work is unknown. Since the story mentions Bhoja (died 1055 CE), it must have been composed in or after the 11th century.
Five primary recensions of the Sanskrit version Simhasana-dvatrimsika are dated to 13th and 14th centuries.
Khulasat-ut-Tawarikh (1695 CE) by Sujan Rai claims that the work had been authored by Pandit Braj, the wazir (prime minister) of Bhoja.

Translations
`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni translated the stories into Persian for the Mughal emperor Akbar, as Nama - Khirad Afza (""Wisdom-enhancing book""). The translation was completed in 1581 CE. Other titles for the Persian translation include Gul Afshan and Senguehassen Battisi.
Lallu Lal and Kazim Ali Javan translated it into Hindi. During 1814-15, William Carey published the Marathi translation under the title Simhasana Battisi, along with Panchatantra and Hitopadesha. The 17th century poet Shamal Bhatt had adapted these stories as narrative poetry.
Franklin Edgerton translated it as ""The Adventures of Vikrama"" in four of its popular rescensions. It is sometimes published along with the Baital Pachisi.
Koravi Goparaju translated it into Telugu language in 15th century as Simhasana Dwitrimsika. It was published by Andhra Sahitya Parishad, Kakinana in 1936 under the editorship of Vemparala Suryanarayana Sastry. Subsequently Andhra Pradesh Sahitya Akademi, Hyderabad published in one volume in 1982. The editor Gadiyaram Ramakrishna Sarma has written a detailed Foreword.

TV adaptations
A television adaptation of Singhasan Battisi was aired on Doordarshan in 1985. In 2014, another adaptation was aired on Sony Pal. An Indian animated television series, Singhasan Battisi, produced by Shethia Audio and Video aired on Pogo from 2011–12.

Synopsis
A poor old woman, with nothing to eat, heads for the river to fish and to bathe.  When she comes out of the river, she finds a venomous snake in her pot. She takes it home, so that it bites her and end her misery.  But once she opens the pot, she finds a rich necklace, which she sells to the king, who puts it in a chest. Soon after, when he opens it to show the queen, he instead finds a baby boy, whom the king and his wife raise as their son, and the old woman becomes his nurse. She speaks of how that boy came about.
The king agrees with a neighboring king that their children should marry. But when the other king's daughter goes to marry, her mother warns her to ask about the magic birth. The princess refuses to speak until the son tells her that he was a prince from far off, who had been turned into a snake, and then he became a snake again. The princess mourns for the prince where he had vanished, and the snake comes to her, telling if she puts bowls of milk and sugar in the four corners of the room, many snakes will come, led by their Queen. If she stands in the Queen's way, she can ask for her husband; but if she's frightened and does not do her bidding, she cannot have him back.
The princess does as he said, and wins back her husband.

Analysis
Tale type
American folklorist D. L. Ashliman classified the tale in the Aarne-Thompson Index as type 425A, ""The Monster (Animal) as Bridegroom"". These tales refer to a human maiden married to an animal husband that, in actuality, is a human prince under a magical disguise. He disappears and she has to gain him back.

Related tales
Scholarship also points that a story of a maiden marrying a snake being is attested in the Panchatantra, an Indian collection of folkloric accounts and related tales.

Motifs
According to Stith Thompson and Jonas Balys study of motifs of Indian literature and oral folklore, the tale contains the motif D432 ""Transformation: mineral form to person"" (in this case, a jewel necklace).

The husband's vanishing
In his work about Cupid and Psyche and other Animal as Bridegroom tales, Swedish scholar Jan-Öjvind Swahn identified that, in certain tales, the heroine causes her supernatural husband's disappearance by inquiring his name. Swahn named this motif The Name Taboo and surmised that it occurred ""primarily in India"". In Thompson and Roberts's Types of Indic Oral Tales, this motif appears in Indic type 425D Ind, ""Search for Serpent Husband"": the heroine insists to know her husband's caste or name, and he, in return, gives her an answer, but vanishes in the water like a snake.

Origins
The tale originated in the Soomra dynasty period in the 10th century. Later, it was found in the texts of Shah Abdul Karim Bulri and lastly in Shah Jo Risalo. It is one of seven popular tragic romances from Sindh, commonly known as The Seven Queens of Sindh (Sindhi:ست سورميون‎) of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai. Sohni remains one of the favourite folktales both in Sindh and Punjab.

Sindhi version
The Sindhi version of the folk tragedy, known as Suhni Mehar, was composed by Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai based on an old narration.

Background
Suhni belonged to the Samtia clan and was the daughter of Jarkat Samtio. While Mehar, a herder, belonged to the Nagamro clan and was the son of Gehwar Jam. Mehar's original name was Saahar. This folk narration belongs to the initial Soomra period in Sindh in the 10th century. This narration is connected with one of the outlets of the Indus River, named Luhano Dhoro, which then turned to flow west of Shahdadpur. During the caliphal period, this river used to flow on the east side of Shahdadpur.

Tale
Suhni was married to Dam (Sindhi: ڏم), belonging to the Wahucho clan. During the rituals of the marriage of Suhni & Dam, their parents forgot to offer them milk as a tradition and when the married party was returning and was delayed to cross the river; while staying on a river bank, a few old ladies felt unpleasant not to offer the milk to the married couple and asked to perform the same ritual and nearby was Mehar's cattle farm who offered them milk which was drunk by Suhni. As soon as she drank the milk, she got disturbed and was attracted to Mehar.
She used to visit Mehar daily, crossing the river with baked earthen pots. But she soon was exposed to her parents, who forbade her to meet Mehar but all in vain. This practice continued and her mother-in-law one night replaced the baked earthen pot with an unbaked one. Suhni did not check the pot as usual and started swimming in the river. When she reached the deep waters, the unbaked pot was destroyed and she was drowned. While she was crying, Mehar heard her and called the fisherman to save her. But it was too late and finally, the dead body of Suhni was recovered. Mehar himself buried her and got constructed a tomb over her grave which is still visited by people in Shahdadpur. Later on, after a few years, Mehar also expired and was buried in Shahdadpur.

Tomb of Suhni
In Sindh, Suhni's shrine is located at Shahdadpur of Sanghar District and is still visited by people as a historical site.

Punjabi version
In the 18th century (late Mughal period), a beautiful girl, Sohni, was born to a potter named Tulla.  Their family belonged to the Kumhar community, and lived in the town of Gujrat in northern Punjab. At the time, Gujrat, located on the banks of river Chenab, was a caravanserai on the trade route between Bukhara and Delhi.
As Sohni grew up, she helped her father decorate his pots. Their shop is said to have been near Ram Pyari Mahal by the river. As soon as the Surahis (water-pitchers) and mugs came off the wheel, she would draw artistic designs on them and set them up for sale.

Izzat Baig of Bukhara
Izzat Baig, a rich trader from Bukhara, came to Punjab on business and halted in Gujrat. Here he saw Sohni at the shop and was completely smitten.  Just to get a glimpse of Sohni, he would end up buying the water pitchers and mugs every day.
Sohni too lost her heart to Izzat Baig. Instead of returning to Bukhara with his caravan, the noble-born Izzat Baig took up the job of a servant in the house of Tulla. He would even take their buffaloes for grazing. Soon, he came to be known as ""Mahiwal"" (buffalo herder in Punjabi).

Sohni's marriage
The love of Sohni and Mahiwal caused a commotion within the Kumhar community. It was not acceptable that a daughter from this community would marry an outsider, so her parents immediately arranged her marriage with another potter. On the day the ""barat"" (marriage party) of that potter arrived at her house, Sohni felt helpless and lost. She was sent off to the husband's house in a Doli (palanquin).
Izzat Baig renounced the world and started living as a faqir (hermit). He eventually moved to a small hut across the river Chenab from Sohni's new home. In the dark of night, when the world was fast asleep, the lovers would meet by the river. Izzat would come to the riverside and Sohni would come to meet him swimming with the help of an inverted hard baked pitcher (inverted so that it would not sink). He would regularly catch a fish and bring it for her. It is said that once, when due to high tide he could not catch a fish, Mahiwal cut a piece of his thigh and roasted it. Sohni didn't realise this at first but then she told Izzat that this fish tastes different. When she kept her hand on his leg, she realised what Mahiwal had done and this only strengthened their love for each other.

Tragic end
Meanwhile, rumours of their romantic rendezvous spread. One day Sohni's sister-in-law followed her and saw the hiding place where Sohni kept her earthenware pitcher. She informed her mother, Sohni's mother-in-law, and instead of telling Sohni's husband (who was away on a business trip), the women decided to take the decision in their own hands and finish the matter. The next day, the sister-in-law removed the hard baked pitcher and replaced it with an unbaked one. That night, when Sohni tried to cross the river with the help of the pitcher, it dissolved in the water and Sohni drowned. From the other side of the river, Mahiwal saw Sohni drowning and jumped into the river to save her and drowned as well. Thus, the lovers were reunited in death.

Popular culture
The story of Sohni and Mahiwal was popularized in the Punjabi qissa (long poem) Sohni Mahiwal by Fazal Shah Sayyad, who also wrote poems on Heer Ranjha, Laila Majnu and others.
The Sohni Mahiwal love story continues to inspire numerous modern songs, including Pathanay Khan's famous song Sohni Gharay nu akhadi aj mainu yaar milaa ghadeya. Earlier Nawab Kumhar Inayat Kotia and later Alam Lohar have also made many renditions of this kalaam and were among the first singers to present the story in a song format. Pakistani pop band Noori's song Dobara Phir Se is inspired by the lore of this story as well as the more recent, Paar channa de, from Coke Studio Pakistan (season 9). Paar channa de was earlier sung by Arif Lohar and Saleema Jawwad for 2013 movie Zinda Bhaag, based on a traditional folk song.
Many paintings of Sohni Mahiwal continue to be created by well-known artists such as Sobha Singh. Folk versions of these paintings, for example in the Kangra style, are commonly found across the whole Punjab region.
Four Hindi film versions, named Sohni Mahiwal have been made in India:

1933 by Harshadrai Sakerlal Mehta; starring Gauhar Karnataki, Master Chonkar, Shivrani and Master Kanti.
1946 directed by Ishwarlal and Ravindra Jaykar; starring Ishwarlal and Begum Para.
1958 by Raja Nawathe; starring Bharat Bhushan and Nimmi.
1984 directed by Kanwal Biala, Latif Faiziyev and Umesh Mehra; starring Sunny Deol and Poonam Dhillon.
Other Indian films including silent ones based on the romance are:

Sohni Mahiwal (1928) by K.P. Bhave, starring Gauhar Karnataki and Jamshedji.
Sohni Mahiwal (1928) by Anand Prasad Kapoor, starring Himat, Miss Mani, Master Vithal and Zebunissa.
Sohni Mahiwal (1939) by Roshan Lal Shorey.
Sohni Mahiwaal (1984) by Kanwal Biala, starring Daljit Kaur, Arun Chopra, Mehar Mittal and Kanchan Mattu.

It is sometimes called the 'Viyog', or 'separation' song. This folk song is usually sung during the paddy harvest. After Deepawali, Gondi women continue singing the song for two months.
The song is intended to celebrate the marriage between two gods, Shiva and Parvati alongside traditional dances. In some places, this song is sung by making earthen Sua (parrot). It starts a few days before Diwali and ends with the marriage of Shiva-Parvati (Gaura-Gauri) on Diwali. This is considered to be the adherent song.

It was last translated to English in 2000 CE.

Structure
The collection, following the story within a story format to maintain continuity, actually contains 72 stories, of which one story acts as the main narrative. The remaining 71 stories are narrated by the parrot.
The main story is that of Madana Vinoda, the wayward son of a merchant, and his wife Padmavati. The merchant's Brahmin friend tries to bring Madana to the path of righteousness by giving him a pet talking parrot. This attempt is successful as the parrot narrates a story that brings Madana to the path of duty. Having learnt his lesson, he sets off on a voyage, presumably on a business venture, leaving his wife alone.
Padmavati, though initially dejected by her husband's departure, soon falls into the company of wanton women who suggest that she take on a lover. She agrees, and every night for the next seventy nights, she gets ready to meet him. But she is thwarted in her attempt every single night by the parrot, which adopts the stratagem of telling her a story. The parrot typically expresses approval of its mistress' intention by agreeing that the goal of life was to seek pleasure and acknowledges the strength of sexual desire. Then it excites her interest by asking whether she had the wits to escape if any troublesome situation were to arise, as the protagonist of her next story had. Padmavati naturally wants to know the details of the story and the parrot proceeds to narrate it. At the end of the story, Padmavati decides not to go for her rendezvous that night.
On the seventieth night, Madana returns and Padmavati has learnt the errors of her ways. Prompted by the parrot, she makes a full confession to her husband, thanking the parrot for keeping her from physical infidelity. The parrot's seventieth story is in fact a plea for forgiveness on the grounds that Padmavati was not fully responsible for her fault, having been led astray by bad company.

Stories
The typical story involves a wife being surprised by her husband while she is in the act of committing adultery. She has to use her wits to get out of her predicament, which she always does. In one story, she has to pass between the legs of a Yaksha, a feat impossible to achieve unless one has told the truth. The wife manages it by having her lover dress up as a lunatic and grab her — as a result, she is able to truthfully swear that no one except her husband and the lunatic has ever touched her in her life.
Frequently the stories test the limits of taboo. In one case, the wife introduces her lover as a cousin to enable his entry into the house. When the lover refuses to have sex with her on the ground that he is now her brother, she threatens to accuse him of rape and gains his acquiescence. In another story, the wife has both father and son as lovers, and she has to deal with the problem of what to do when her husband stumbles upon the scene.
The stories are often blunt, verging on pornography. In one case, the cuckolded husband has managed to grab his rival's penis while the lover was having sex with the wife literally behind the husband's back. The wife then has the unenviable task of devising a way to extricate her lover. The cuckolds are generally unaware of the situation though some times they are portrayed as simpleminded, and the wives often take advantage of their ignorance and superstitious nature.  However, in one case, the husband, a king, is impressed by the lover's wit and lets his wife go with him, reasoning that while poets like the lover are rare, women like his wife are not.
The less typical story involves men being in similar situations, though in this case the trouble still comes in the form of the woman's husband rather than the man's wife. Other common stories revolve around men using the threat of embarrassment to regain gifts they showered on their lovers, often harlots. Dalliances involving unmarried women having illicit sex are very rare — with the obvious exception of prostitutes.
One story manages to simultaneously stray into zoophilia and poke fun at a divinity. It involves a woman who has promised to kiss the idol of Ganapati if she achieves a particular (wholly legitimate) goal.  The mischievous idol grabs her lips and wouldn't let go.  The husband has to make the idol laugh by simulating sex with a donkey to rescue his wife.
The stories form an ""absorbing social document"" of those times. It portrays a society where women's sexuality is openly accepted and prostitutes are accepted as a semi-legitimate part of society. In one story, a father engages a procuress to teach his son the art of safeguarding his wealth from the guiles of courtesans.
Not all stories involve sexual escapades. Some deal with other tricky situations that one can encounter in life and of them some have been lifted straight from the Panchatantra.

Verses
As with many Sanskrit texts, there are verses interspersed with prose that form part of the narrative.
Some are erotic:

The best of the lover's couches
is higher on the sides 
sunken at the centre
it will also bear the strong
poundings of a couple's passion
The middling bed is flat of surface
so that the night will often pass
with rarely any contact
between the bodies two.
The worst is raised at the centre,
and both its sides slope down;
even adepts in the art cannot 

make love on it continuously
And some describe profound wisdom:

The rich man is wise,
he is generous and good,
the honoured kin of everyone;
but when his money goes,

so does his glory.
In some cases the verses are part of the story and actually act as part of the conversation between the characters. In others, they are merely regurgitations of earlier works such as the Hitopadesha, the Panchatantra, and even the Puranas.

History
Though the collection's oldest known manuscript dates back only to the 15th century, there are references to it in other works much earlier.  Current scholarship dates the book in its current form to the 12th century, though the individual stories in it are much older and are often found in the Jataka tales and in the Kathasaritsagara.
There are two versions of the work available in Sanskrit, the simplicior version attributed to a Brahmin Chintamani has been described as having a ""simple, somewhat abrupt style"" while the ornatior version, attributed to a Jain monk Shvetambara is ""elaborate and ornate"". The simplicior version is considered to be older. The names simplicior and ornatior were assigned by German scholar Richard Schmidt.

Translations
There have been many translations of the work into both Indian and non-Indian languages.  In the 14th century, Persian scholar Nakhshabi translated it as Tutinama. This in turn was translated into Turkish and formed the basis for the German translation, which was the first one into a Western language.
The German translation, ""Der textus ornatior der Çukasaptati"", translated by Richard Schmidt was published in the year 1896 in Stuttgart by W Kohlhammer.
It has been translated into Telugu poetic form by Palavekari Kadiripati. Vavilla Ramaswamy Sastrulu and Sons published the work in 1935 and 1951. It was  published by Andhra Pradesh Sahitya Akademi in 1979 under the editorship of B. Ramaraju.
A Malayalam translation is available for the work, named as Thatha Paranja Kathakal
In 2000, HarperCollins India published a translation from the original Sanskrit done by Indian diplomat-scholar A N D Haksar. The book claims that this was the first rendition into English that made use of the original Sanskrit, as against the Persian translation.

He first appears in Arabic renditions as an Indian philosopher who lived around 100 BC.
Due to the popularity of Seven Wise Masters, he was also credited with a collection of Greek-derived fables in medieval times.

Origins and development
The framework story (story within a story) in which Syntipas plays a leading part accompanies the immensely popular cluster of tales, reminiscent of the 1001 Nights, known generally in Europe as the History of the Seven Wise Masters (Historia Septem Sapientium) or Dolopathos. It is conjectured to have been of Indian or Persian origin and was eventually transmitted into many Oriental and Western languages. A Syriac version was translated into Greek by the Byzantine author Michael Andreopoulos at the end of the 11th century under the title of The Book of the Philosopher Syntipas. In his introduction, Andreopoulos describes it as a story which “derides evildoers and, towards its end, praises righteous deeds,” thus excusing a work otherwise characterised by “exoticism and eroticism”. Another version was translated from Arabic into Spanish in the thirteenth century as The Book of the Wiles of Women (Spanish: El Libro de los Enganos e los Asayamientos de las Mugeres). 
In the Greek version, Syntipas is counsellor to King Cyrus and tutor to his son who, having taken a vow of silence for seven days, is accused by his stepmother of trying to seduce her. Over successive days there follows a competition of stories and counter-stories told by the king’s advisory philosophers and the stepmother whose advances he has rejected, thus putting off the prince’s execution until he is at liberty to tell the truth. This denouement is followed by a few other tales illustrative of the situation.
Although a few of the 27 stories that appear there concern animals, the main protagonists of the majority are humans. This proportion was reversed in The Fables of Syntipas, a Syriac fable collection also translated by Andreopoulos which accompanied the Syntipas romance in some manuscripts. A Latin version of these was published in 1781 by Christian Frederick Matthaei, drawing the attention of scholars interested in the transmission of Aesop’s Fables. Eventually it was demonstrated that most had been translated into Syriac from an old Greek source as recently as the 9th century or later. Nearly a quarter of the 62 appearing there are not Aesopic, but otherwise it includes such well known examples as The Ant and the Grasshopper, The North Wind and the Sun and The Farmer and the Viper.

While legend says that Amir Khusro was the author, the tales were written long after his death.  Legend has it that Amir Khusro's master and Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya had fallen ill.  To cheer him up, Amir Khusro started telling him a series of stories in the style of the One Thousand and One Nights.

Style
The book is in some ways similar to the Thousand and One Nights in its method of framing and linking unfinished stories within each other. The central character is a king, Azad Bakht, who falls into depression after thinking about his own mortality, and so sets out from his palace seeking wise men. He comes upon four dervishes in a cemetery, and listens to their fantastical stories. Each Dervish narrates his own story, which is basically on love and fidelity in their own past lives. When the fourth dervish finishes his tale, the king Azadbakht suddenly learns that one of his wives has just born the son to him. Overwhelmed with joy, the king orders to arrange a great feast. With the help of the great king of jinns, Malik Syahpal, Azadbakht marries all the separated lovers to one another: the merchant's son from Yemen to the princess of Damsyik, the prince of Fars to the princess of Basra, the prince of Ajam to the princess of Farang, the prince of Nimroz to the princess of jinns, and the prince of China to the daughter of the courtier, who was kidnapped by Malik Sadik. Everyone happily achieves the fulfillment of his or her desire.

Translations
These stories were originally written in Persian by Amir Khusro as Qissa-ye Chahār Darvēsh.  It was initially translated by Mir Husain Ata Tehseen into Urdu as Nav Tarz-e-Murassaa (نو طرزِ مُرصّع, ""New Ornate Style"") but the language was a highly literate one and was not understood by general public to enjoy.  In 1801, College of Fort William in Calcutta started a project translating Indian literature.  Mr. John Borthwick Gilchrist, a famous scholar of literature, asked Mir Amman, an employee of the college, to translate it into the Urdu language.  Mir Amman translated it from Persian into everyday Urdu, under the title Bāgh o Bahār.  Later, in 1857, Duncan Forbes retranslated it into English.  The translation of Mir Amman is still enjoyed as a classical work of Urdu Literature for the common daily language of its time.

Adaptations
The Indian films Char Darvesh (1933) by Prafulla Ghosh and Char Dervesh (1964) by Homi Wadia were based on the stories.

The legend
When Akbar's court singer, maestro Tansen's preceptor died, he sang the raag ""Deepak"". The effect of singing this raag is said to be that the singer starts feeling an incurable heat in his/her body. When Tansen was affected by the burns of the Deepak raag, he roamed around the whole of India. Finally the commander in chief of their army, Amjadkhan, came to Vadnagar and learned of the two sisters Tana and Riri who were proficient singers and could cure Tansen (expert of raag dipak) by singing raga Malhar. When they were asked to sing at Akbar's court, they refused to come since it was their vow as Nagars only to sing in front of the village deity's idol. So they asked Tansen instead to come to their home if he would want to subside the effect of raag deepak; which he agreed to. Women did not leave their houses and go elsewhere in those days. Thus these twin sisters became renowned as the only singers who were able to cure Tansen in whole India. Later on king Akbar invited them to become his court singers but they refused as they would only sing in front of God and not any king. So after one or more requests Akbar sent army to fetch them. Instead they killed themselves by drowning in a well. They chose to do this rather than to refuse, which would have caused conflict in their town. When Akbar learned of it he apologised to their father and asked Tansen to develop a new genre of pieces named in honor of Tana-Riri.

Legacy
A memorial has been erected in Vadnagar to honour Tana-Riri.
Tana-Riri Music Festival is organised every year by Government of Gujarat in their dedication.

The origins of Telugu folk literature
Telugu is the most widely spoken Dravidian language on Earth and is spoken in all of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in India and parts of other southern states as well. The history of Telugu goes back as early as to 230 BC to 225 AD, and the evidence for the existence of Telugu language is available in the Natya Shastra of the Bharatha people. Even better evidence is shown from the inscription of Nandampudi, written by the first Telugu poet Nannya, which goes back to the 11th century AD. The author of Samagrandhra Sahityam (The Comprehensive history of Telugu Literature) Aarudhra has developed a different kind of argument. He says the word ""naagabu"" is there in an inscription of the Amaravati Stupa Buddha Sthupa, built between 200 BC to 200 AD the suffix of this word 'bu' is a typical Telugu suffix and it can not be there unless the language was considerably developed in spoken form. (He considered the word a sacred 'mantra' and printed it on the top place of the cover page of his book). More reliable evidence for the existence of Telugu language were shown by him at least from 350 AD. Based on this evidence it is possible to come to a rough idea that the verbal expressive traditions of Telugus may be there even at the beginning of the common era.
Indisputable concrete historical evidence of Telugu folk literature is available in the poetical work of the Kumārasambhava by Nanne Choda who belongs to the 11th and 12th centuries. He has mentioned different kinds of songs sung by different folk groups (goudu geetamulu or songs of gouds). Some more inscriptional evidence for the existence of folk literature are also available in the 6th century AD. According to Ramaraju, some of the prosodic structures found in this period very closely resemble to the metrical order of folk songs of modern times. The evidence may not clearly show a particular song or its existence but one cannot rule out the possible existence of folk literature even before this period as the evidence for the existence of Telugu language was there from a much earlier period.
Many traditional Telugu poetical works of earlier and medieval age, taking form the Palkuriki Somanadha's Basava purana to the Yakshagana (written works) of Nayaka kings of the 17th century, have mentioned about different performing castes and performing traditions, which were living and moving in the Andhra desa i.e., the present Andhra Pradesh.

Taxonomy of Telugu folk literary genres
The Telugu folk literature is so enormously rich that it contains all major categories of world folk literature. The folk literary categories, which were classified in various languages by the scholars across the world, can be found in the Telugu folk literature. Some unique kind of folk literary forms like caste myth also can be found in it. It is very rich not only in terms of variety of genres but the enormous size of the repertoires of various performing castes and individual singers. Many scholars have already classified Telugu folk literature in different divisions and sub divisions in an efficient way depending on the material they have considered for the study. Krishna Kumari's classification is more comprehensive even among other works on Telugu folk literature. But few genres were missing even in this classification. She did not consider caste myth as a separate genre. It occupies a large share of Telugu folk literature and a prominent place in terms of its social importance and function. And some more subdivisions can also be found in a close look at the grassroot level of Telugu folk literature.
Telugu folk literature can be classified on different aspects. The first aspect is on genre, second is on the persons and patronage, the third one is by utility. It would be convenient to elaborate in reverse direction and first I would take utility aspect.

Functional and entertainment genres
Telugu folk literature can be classified on the basis of its utility, that is, how it functions. It can be divided into functional and nonfunctional or entertainment genres. Some of the literary forms are both. Caste myths and ritual narratives have specific social functions. They are not for entertainment. They are intended to carry a specific social function.

Caste myths
A caste myth is basically a myth by its sacrality, and it is unique by its structure and function. A caste myth is called a Kula Purana or Caste Purana. Names of these myths are formed along the name of the caste, like Gouda purana for the caste of Goudas, Rjaka puranams for Rajakas or Chakalivaru Washer men and so on. A caste myth is a myth or a narrative of a caste which explains the origin and establishment of a caste. It tries to establish a given caste as a higher most one in the social order and it is not inferior to any other caste. Each caste of 196 castes in Andhra Pradesh having its own Caste myth. Caste myths are very important folk literary forms in terms of their social function. They are very much alive and vigorous in functions, even in the modern democratic social order. Several evidences prove the existence of the caste myths in oral tradition and written tradition even from the 11th century. Each caste has its own myth and the time for its narration may vary from three hours to 14 nights, i.e. at least 100 hours. Most castes of Andhra Pradesh have their own performing dependent castes to narrate or perform their caste myths once in a year in each patron family. They are called Arthi kulalu or Asrita kulalu. There are more than 50 dependent performing castes still existing and functioning in A.P. A caste myth is an origin narrative of a given caste and it is the pride of the each member of any caste. It is a sacred narrative, whose validity cannot be questioned, and it is a Mahabharata for that particular caste. Caste myths are available in song, performing and prose narrative forms in oral tradition. Though it is a myth by genre, caste myth has a different kind of structure than the general myth, so that the caste myth is itself an independent folk genre. (See: Kulapuranalu Asrita Vyavastha, Subbachary, p. 2000: for the detailed study of the caste myths and the dependent caste system.)

Ritual narratives
A ritual narrative is narrative sung or performed in a ritual, as an inseparable part of that ritual. It loses its importance when it is dissociated from that ritual. It is another functional narrative. These narratives are nothing but the narratives of Goddesses and Gods. The mother goddess narratives of A.P enjoy a prominent social relevance. They are sung or performed in the Jataras or Tirunallas of the Mother goddess and the Perantalu or the deified women goddesses. The mother goddesses like Ankamma, Maremma, Poleramma, Peddamma, Atalamma, Ellamma, Pochamma and so on are considered to be the goddesses of diseases. They are the destructive or malevolent goddesses. They are also protective or guardian deities but their prominence is for their destructive power. They have to be appeased from time to time or annually, otherwise they would show their wrath by creating epidemics. The best ways to appease these goddess are to sing the narrative of the relevant goddess in her praise and offer her animal sacrifices. Performing the narrative or the puranam or the myth of the goddess is very crucial in the weekday ritual of any mother goddess. These myths are very long and performed over from one night to seven nights. The audience listens to them not only with reverence but also with fear and obedience. They also go into trance when the narratives are performed. Specific caste people from dalit communities Baindlas, Asadis are specialized and traditional singers for all these mother goddesses. The Kurumas are singers for the myths of the male gods Mallanna, Birappa and the Goddess Ellamma. The literature of these myths or the narratives is also very big repertoire in Telugu folk literature. Mother goddess narratives are performed in several hundred places in A.P. every year. A number of scholars Krishna Kumari.N, Venkata Subbarao.T.V, Premalata Ravi. Andamma.M and others have done commendable research on mother goddess worship and narratives.

Proverbs
Another important and powerful functional genre is the Telugu sameta or the Telugu proverb. Any other folk literary genre may not be a part of everyday life of the speaker of a given language. But proverbs are part of day-to-day life. For the native speakers the proverb is an essential tool for their communicative needs and it is a folk literary genre.
Telugu folk literature has a stunningly rich treasure trove of proverbs. People use them in any mode of their expression. Number of researchers have already collected thousands of proverbs and published them region wide. One scholar, Chilukuri Narayana Rao, has collected to one hundred thousand proverbs to his credit. Lot of research was also done on various aspects of Telugu proverbs. Several Colonial officials too collected Telugu proverbs. Captain Carr's collection is prominent among them. He collected around three thousand proverbs and translated them into English. One can find parallels in Telugu to the proverbs which are omnipresent in different languages across the world.
These are some of the basic Telugu folk literary forms which are in social function. The other folk literary forms or basically intended for entertainment their social function is secondary.

Persons and professional singers and patronage
The second kind of classification can be made on the basis of persons and patronage. Telugu folk literature can be divided in two major classes: folk literature created by professional singers and/or performers and the literature created by others. The folk literary genres created by the professional performers are different from the other genres in terms of length, prose and poetry combination, narration, and in other aspects. A number of castes of Andhra Pradesh are specialized to perform different kinds folk art forms in which literature is a vital part. Singing and performing is their basic profession  and they get lively hood by this profession. Again the professional singers or the bards or ministerial can be divided into two kinds some performing castes perform their art form to any caste or family of any village. For example, snake charmers or Pamula vallu, Haridasus, Satanis, Jangamas, Saradakadus and such other performers when they enter into a village they do not restrict their singing to only some castes or families. Other kind of singers do not extend their services to any body except their own patrons. They are dependents to only one caste. They narrate myths, caste myths, or other narratives only to their patrons. Narrating to others encroaching into other singer's jurisdiction is a crime according to their caste laws.
Most of the important Telugu folk narratives, myths, legends are created by the professional singers and performers of the performing caste, all the caste myths are created by the dependent caste singers or the Asritakulalavaru. Other important epics like Mahabharata, Ramayana, Palanati Virakatha, Bobbilikatha, Katamaraju Kathalu, the myths of mother goddesses, and other important lengthy wonder tales which are very popular among Telugus are created by professional singers or the caste performers.
The folk literature created by men, women, and children consists of folk songs, song narratives, lullabies, work songs, women songs, different other kind of songs, general tales, wonder tales proverbs, riddles and so on. Telugu folk literature is very rich for all these genres. Collection and researching of these folk genres has been started in the colonial period itself. After the advent of universities in A.P several scholars did research on all kinds of these genres.

The arena of folk literary genres
One classification of folk literature is genre based. Krishnakumari made a comprehensive classification of Telugu folk literature. It can be followed here to enumerate the Telugu folk literature and some more items can also be added to this classification.
The Telugu folk literature has three basic divisions.

Prose or Vachana Sakha
The Prose division has two important sections they are Katha Sahitham or Prose with story and Katha Rahitham or prose without story. The section prose with story contains Nitikathalu (moral tales) Vira Kathalu, (epics) Adbhuta Kathalu (wonder tales), Purakathalu (myths), Itihasalu (legends) Pedarasi Peddamma Kathalu (fables). Some more categories can also be identified like Kula Kathalu (caste myths in prose), Perantalla Kathalu (stories of deified women), Tirpu Kathalu (stories of judgments), and so on. The non-story prose genres are proverbs and riddles or Sametalu and Podupukathalu.

Poetry or Geya Sakha
The poetry division again has Story and non-story sections. In story section Sramika Geyamulu (work songs), Strila patalu (women songs) Asrita kulala vari Patalu (songs by different caste performers) are there. In work songs male female division is there. The songs by women while they are working in fields are very important. Several stories are revealed and they give vent to their feelings through these stories. The songs at home are different from these songs not only in rhythm but also in length and mode of narration. The women songs can be classified into vrata kathalu or the stories of women rituals and pouranika stories or the mythological stores. Songs of the professional singers or the dependent castes can be categorized into Vira Kathalu (heroic songs or ballads), Adbhuta Kathalu (wonder tales or fairy tales), Purakathalu (general myths and myths of mother goddesses), Charitraka Kathalu (historical songs) Strila kathalu (women related stories). The non-story section in the Poetry division contain three important categories they are Sharmika Geyamulu or work songs, Paramarthika Geyamulu or mystic songs and Koutumbika Geyamulu or family songs. The work songs contain stringara (erotic), hasya (humor) and karuna (pathetic) kinds of songs and the family songs contain bandhutwa (songs of relation), and achara (ceremonious songs).

Drama or Drisya Sakha
The third division is Drisya Sakha, folk drama or folk theatre. Telugu folklore is very rich in folk theatre. Most of the art forms of (more than fifty) the dependant castes are theatre forms. The art forms like Oggu katha, Bindla Katha, Kommula Katha, Sarada Katha, Burra katha, Runja Katha, Chindu Yakshaganam, chirutala Yakshaganam, Patam katha, Pandava Katha, and several folk art forms are very popular theatre forms in which the spoken word is vital, are very rich for literature. Vidhi natakam, Yakshaganam, Turpu Bhagotam, and some other folk art forms are there which are for all castes in any village. The theatre division can be classified into two sections one is theatre by the artists the other is puppet theatre. Literature is an essential ingredient even in the puppet theatre. The Ramayana story is basic theme for the shadow puppet theatre of Andhra Pradesh. Patam Katha or the scroll narrative contains the Mahabharata as its theme, entire Mahabharata is narrated in different episodes in the art form of Pandavalu and Kakipadagalu artists. Some other mythical caste mythical themes are also there is form of scroll narratives. Still there are more than 72 folk theatre art forms are living in the region.
The above classification is the general and primary genre based classification of Telugu folk literature. Innumerable number of examples for each category can be given. Each above category in all major divisions and different sections is very rich. It would be impractical in this paper to showcase them. But introducing some of the songs and narratives here would serve the purpose.

Songs of the soil
Some Telugu folk narratives are very popular in Andhra Pradesh. They are associated with the history and folk life of the region. Even the Mahabharata and Ramayana stories and a plethora of historical and semihistorical narratives in various folk art forms acclaimed wide popularity and educated the rural non-literate people. They know the gods and goddesses kings and queens primarily from the folk narratives and visual media like Vidhi natakam (street play) Tolubommalata (shadow puppet theatre) Patam katha (scroll narrative) and so on. The cinema of early times did not try to go much away from the folk art forms. Cinema has not only got interested in folk art forms but also incorporated them in many ways. Folk literature, music, and art forms have their proper places in the cinema. Folk songs and their tunes are big money-making assets even in present day Telugu cinema.

Palnati Vira Charitra
Also called Palaanati Bharatam, this epic resembles the story of Mahabharata; it also contains a ferocious battle between brothers and close relatives. It is a heroic epic of Telugus. The epic is the story of the Haihaya dynasty and belongs to the 12th century. The battle is not just for the throne or the territory it is a battle between two religious philosophies, the Vaishanavism and Shaivism. The Brahmanaidu and the Nagamma take two sides. The Brahmanaidu advocates the equality of the castes and encourages the untouchable community to enter into the temples and allow them to dine with other village caste people. The effort was popularly called Chapakudu. The other religious sect under the leadership of Nagamma opposed the ‘anarchy’ but battled in the guise of cock fight, sending the kings to forests and finally to the battle field. Finally the blood of Telugu heroes and towering philosophy of Brahmanaidu stand victorious, and remained for ever in the land. The characters Brahmanaidu, Balachandrudu, Nagamma, Manchala are very popular in the entire region. The heroes are worshipped in an annual ritual in the folk art form of Pichukunti Katha which is performed by Pichukuntis or the palnati vira vidyavantulu a performing caste of Andhra Pradesh. The singers perform the epic with swords and shields in their hands and use them as props for their performance. The principal narrator takes a sword in the right hand and a shield in the left. A bunch of jingling bells are tied to the sword. The artist uses the sword as a musical instrument and it becomes a valuable prop in the narration of story. The singer becomes a battle hero. The tunes of the songs also appear in a different way. Most of the time they create a mood of sorrow and valor. The Palnati epic is not only a pride symbol of Telugus it is one of the great folk heroic sagas of the nation. Different scholars like Akkairaju Umakantam from the region collected the narrative and published. Gene H. Roghair collected the epic from the Pichukunti performers and published it along with English translation and a scholarly editorial. The epic is very popular not only in Pichukunti katha but also other folk art forms like Burra katha, Sarada katha.

Katamaraju Kathalu
Katamaraju Kathalu is a very long folk ballad, a very popular heroic song of the land. It is a big epic of a battle between the kings of Katamaraju, and Manumasiddhi of the Nellore Chodas. The battle occurred in the 13th century, it is the dispute of territory and the misunderstanding of two kings. The valor of Khadga Tikkana and the Telugu kings has been portrayed in this heroic song and the epic is being carried through folk literature and the art form Kommula Katha or Pumba Katha, performed by the caste Kommulas. Telugu culture and the pastoral life are widely described in the long epic. It is not only rich for the description of culture of the land but also for the poetry and expressions of the singers. The epic singers Kommulas and Pumbalas perform it in such a way that the audience immerses in the themes and they identify themselves in all the rasas or the emotions of the narrative. The folk epic is a symbol of the pride of Telugus. This ballad cycle has been collected and published in two big volumes of around three thousand pages, enriched by scholarly editorial by Tangirala Venkata Subbarao.

Bobbili Katha
It is another heroic folk epic of Telugu it is not just an epic it is a recent history of Telugu land. Bobbili is a small principalityof Northern Andhra. The French commander, Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau, attacked the fort of Bobbili in 1757. This is happened because of the rivalry between the two kingdoms of Bobbili and Vijayanagaram. Ultimately the treachery of kind Vijayaramaraju resulted in the war. The Bobbili heroes fought against the guns and cannons of French soldiers with their swords and arrows until they fall on the battlefield. The French soldiers were astonished by the utmost courage shown by the kings of Bobbili and other soldiers and even by the women soldiers. The heroes Paparayudu, Rangarayudu, and Vengalarayudu became househo;d words in Andhra. The people sing the valor of their heroes with pride. The saga of heroes remained in different folk literary genres i.e. song, drama Burrakatha, Sarada Katha apart from the classical literary forms.

Other important narratives
Apart from the above very popular folk literary themes some other themes are also very popular in the land even in the modern times. All the caste myths regularly performed by the caste singers are very popular and considered sacred and authentic by their respective castes. More than 150 caste myths are alive and vibrant among the castes. Most of the myths of mother goddesses and the Perantal goddesses are also popular and heard with high respect, Ankamma katha, Maremma katha Ellamma katha, Mandhata katha, Tirupamma katha, Kamma katha, Sanysamma katha and such myths are still have currency in the folk life of Andhras. They are still being performed in the annual Jataras of the goddesses in most of the parts of Andhra.
Different types of folk tales shown in the aforementioned classification exist in Telugu folk literature. Short fables, bedtime tales, long wonder tales and such other types of tales still exist in large numbers. Balanagamma katha, Kumara Ramuni katha, Desingu raju katha and kasimajuli kathalu, Tenali Ramalingani kathalu and other tale cycles are very popular and taking breath in the winds of the Telugu villages.
Telugu folk song has a strong life it is very powerful across the ages. It is not only amusing the people by its sweet tunes but also shivering the misrules with its powerful words. Folk song when it is applied for the revolutionary is becoming a weapon. Folk song is not inferior to any literary genre, and it is very rich in Andhra Pradesh.
Hundreds and thousands of folk songs were collected right from 1850 to present day, several collections were published and number of scholars did research on different themes of folk songs and published these. Still lot of work has to be done and collection of the folk songs in district, mandal and village level has to be under taken. Song narratives particularly women's narratives on different themes are very important. Little attention has been paid to this genre. Song narratives of women are of two kinds: one is for at work and the other is for at home and in domestic rituals of vratas. Both are very important in terms of literature and gender issues.
Riddle is another very important prose genre of Telugu folk literature. Riddles in Telugu are entertaining and educating not only for the children but also for the elders. They come down from generation to generation. Telugu riddle does not have any ritual importance like riddles among other ethnic groups of the land. Thousands of riddles were collected by several scholars and published. Dr. Kasireddy Venkatareddy has done a remarkable research on Telugu riddles.
Some other unique folk literary genres also can be found in Andhra Pradesh in the performances by single individual artists like Pittala Dora, Harikatha and Runja Katha are unique in their mode of presentation and narrative techniques. The narrative in the Pittala dora is very interesting. It does not contain any story or theme but it is a prose rendition goes on more than an hour in each performance. It attracts big crowds in the villages. The text creates high quality of humor by the gossip and themeless boosting speech by the artist. In similar fashion Runja Katha is known for its unique kind of narrating techniques. One artist takes the roles of all characters of the theme. Harikatha is also performed by a single singer but it is supported by two to other musical instruments. Though it can be considered as a folk art form it is a semi classical in its nature, music and literature. Most of the themes in Harikatha are mythological.

Certain characters and stories like ""Lalkamal-Nilkamal"", ""Buddhu-Bhutum"" and ""Byangoma-Byangomi"", have gained legendary status. Hundreds of editions of this book have been published from Bangladesh and West Bengal since the original publication.

Publishing background
Rabindranath Tagore notes in his introduction to Thakurmar Jhuli, that there was a dire need for folk literature of Bengal to be revived because the only such works available to the reading public of the time were European fairytales and their translations. He expressed the need for a swadeshi or indigenous folk literature that would remind the people of Bengal of their rich oral traditions. This would be a method of contending the cultural imperialism of the British.
Dakshinaranjan recounts the memories of listening to fairytales told by his mother as well as his aunt, in his own introduction to Thakurmar Jhuli. Dakshinaranjan's aunt, Rajlakkhi Debi had given him the duty of visiting the villages in their zamindari. He travelled and listened to Bengali folktales and fairytales being narrated by the village elders. These folk stories were mostly collected from Mymensingh district region of Bangladesh. He recorded this material with a phonograph that he carried, and listened to the recordings repeatedly, imbibing the style. However, he found no publisher initially, and had set up a press to self-publish the first book that would be a compilation of the stories he developed from the recorded tales. At this juncture, Dinesh Chandra Sen, impressed by the manuscript, arranged for it to be published by Bhattacharya and Sons, a renowned publisher of the time. Within a week, three thousand copies were sold. Several illustrations for the collection were also drawn by the author. His drawings were turned into lithographs for printing.

Contents
The book contains fourteen stories, divided into three sections: Dudher Sagor ('Sea of Milk'), Rooptarashi ('Scary Form'), and Chyang Byang ('Fish-Frog'). The final section, Aam Sandesh ('Mangoes and Sweets') contains three poems. Apart from this, some other poems act as introductions to the collection as a whole, and to each section.

Character types and tropes
The first section, Dudher Sagor, contains the very popular stories Kalabati Rajkanya ('Princess Kalabati'), Ghumonto Puri ('The Sleeping Town'), Saat Bhai Champa ('Seven Champa Brothers') and Kiranmala, among others. The former is known elsewhere as ""Buddhu Bhutum"". These stories, like others in the collection, depict characters who initially suffer a series of misfortunes, display admirable personal qualities, like courage, kindness and wit, and eventually rise to great fortune. 
The second section, ""Rooptarashi"", contains what is probably the most popular story from this iconic volume, ""Lalkamal Neelkamal"". These stories usually depict human protagonists encountering other creatures like rakkhoshes, magical snakes, and the like. A rakkhosh, or a Rakshasa, is a race of beings from Hindu mythology, who are known from magical abilities, shapeshifting as well as eating humans, sometimes. The birds with human faces, Byangoma and Byangomi, are also encountered in ""Lalkamal Neelkamal"".
The third section, ""Chyang Byang"" deals with miscellaneous stories, and features some feats by the proverbial ""Sheyal Pandit"" (Fox Pandit).

Language
In his introduction, Tagore noted that Dakhshinaranjan has successfully put into writing, the linguistic flavour of traditional oral tales. The poems read as collages of references to Bengali culture and folklore motifs.

Legacy
The four initial folktale anthologies of Mitra Majumdar are titled after a grandparent, who represents the bygone era and thereby embodies cultural heritage. In the contemporary context, written and digital recordings of these fables seem to have replaced the earlier oral tradition, but Thakurmar Jhuli remains a compilation that is not limited to children alone, and over the years has found tremendous response among the adults. It is a veritable treasure of Bengali literature.

Synopsis
A king with a daughter once was lost while hunting and met a hermit, who prophesied that his daughter would marry a slave woman's son, who belonged to the king of the north.  As soon as he left the forest, he sent an offer to the king of the north for the slave woman and her son.  The other king made him a present of them.  He took them into the forest and cut off the woman's head, and left the child there.
A widow who raised goats found that her best nanny-goat returned without a drop of milk.  She followed the animal when it went to the child, and thought she had at last a son to look after her in her old age.
When the boy was grown, a peddler's donkey started to eat his mother's cabbages, and so he beat it and drove it out.  The tale was borne to the peddler, with added claims that the boy had threatened to kill the peddler.  The peddler complained to the king, who sent men to seize the boy.  The old woman pleaded for his life, because she needed him to support her.  The king, not believing that so old a woman could have so young a son, demanded to know where she had gotten him, and hearing the story, knew who the child was.
The king let him off if he joined the army.  When the army life did not kill him, though he was sent on the most dangerous missions, and he proved a good soldier, he was enrolled in the king's bodyguard and saved him from an assassin.  The king was obliged to make him an attendant, and in his missions for the king, he was continually attacked but always escaped.  Finally, the king sent him with a message to a distant governor, who had charge of the princess.  The mischievous princess was up and about while the rest of the castle slept in the heat of the day and found that the message was to kill the bearer of it.  She substituted a letter ordering the governor to marry him to the princess.
The king, on receiving the news, abandoned his efforts to harm the boy.

Analysis
Folklorist Stith Thompson mentions in his seminal work The Folktale that the tale of the boy predestined to marry a princess can be found in the literary history of India, such is its antiquity.
The tale has several variants found across cultures about a poor boy that is ""protected by Fate"".

The story has become known in the English-speaking world as the source of the word serendipity, coined by Horace Walpole because of his recollection of the part of the ""silly fairy tale"" in which the three princes by ""accidents and sagacity"" discern the nature of a lost camel. In a separate line of descent, the story was used by Voltaire in his 1747 Zadig, and through this contributed to both the evolution of detective fiction and the self-understanding of scientific method.

The story
""In ancient times there existed in the country of Serendippo, in the Far East, a great and powerful king by the name of Giaffer. He had three sons who were very dear to him. And being a good father and very concerned about their education, he decided that he had to leave them endowed not only with great power, but also with all kinds of virtues of which princes are particularly in need.""
The father searches out the best possible tutors. ""And to them he entrusted the training of his sons, with the understanding that the best they could do for him was to teach them in such a way that they could be immediately recognized as his very own.""
When the tutors are pleased with the excellent progress that the three princes make in the arts and sciences, they report it to the king. He, however, still doubts their training, and summoning each in turn, declares that he will retire to the contemplative life leaving them as king. Each politely declines, affirming the father's superior wisdom and fitness to rule.
The king is pleased, but fearing that his sons' education may have been too sheltered and privileged, feigns anger at them for refusing the throne and sends them away from the land.

The lost camel
No sooner do the three princes arrive abroad they trace clues to identify precisely a camel they have never seen. They conclude that the camel is lame, blind in one eye, missing a tooth, carrying a pregnant woman, and bearing honey on one side and butter on the other. When they later encounter the merchant who has lost the camel, they report their observations to him. He accuses them of stealing the camel and takes them to the Emperor Beramo, where he demands punishment.
Beramo then asks how they are able to give such an accurate description of the camel if they have never seen it. It is clear from the princes' replies that they have used small clues to infer cleverly the nature of the camel.
Grass had been eaten from the side of the road where it was less green, so the princes had inferred that the camel was blind on the other side. Because there were lumps of chewed grass on the road that were the size of a camel's tooth, they inferred they had fallen through the gap left by a missing tooth. The tracks showed the prints of only three feet, the fourth being dragged, indicating that the animal was lame. That butter was carried on one side of the camel and honey on the other was evident because ants had been attracted to melted butter on one side of the road and flies to spilled honey on the other.
As for the woman, one of the princes said: ""I guessed that the camel must have carried a woman, because I had noticed that near the tracks where the animal had knelt down the imprint of a foot was visible. Because some urine was nearby, I wet my fingers and as a reaction to its odour I felt a sort of carnal concupiscence, which convinced me that the imprint was of a woman's foot.""
""I guessed that the same woman must have been pregnant"", said another prince, ""because I had noticed nearby handprints which were indicative that the woman, being pregnant, had helped herself up with her hands while urinating.""
At this moment, a traveller enters the scene to say that he has just found a missing camel wandering in the desert. Beramo spares the lives of the three princes, lavishes rich rewards on them, and appoints them to be his advisors.

The story continues
The three princes have many other adventures, where they continue to display their sagacity, stories-within-stories are told, and there is a happy ending.

History
The fairy tale The Three Princes of Serendip is based upon the life of Persian King Bahram V, who ruled the Sassanid Empire (420–440). Stories of his rule are told in epic poetry of the region (Firdausi's Shahnameh of 1010, Nizami's Haft Paykar of 1197, Khusrau's Hasht Bihisht of 1302), parts of which are based upon historical facts with embellishments derived from folklore going back hundreds of years to oral traditions in India and The Book of One Thousand and One Nights. With the exception of the well-known camel story, English translations are very hard to come by.

Talmudic version
A version of the fable of a camel blind in one eye is included in the Talmud, attributed to Rabbi Yochanan. While it might be seen as implying that gentiles, in comparison to Jews, are rude and defecate on the road, it is worth noting that Jewish law has strong injunctions of modesty and cleanliness, including strict injunctions against open or public urination or defecation.

Rava relates the following in the name of Rabbi Yochanan:—""Two Jewish slaves were one day walking along, when their master, who was following, overheard the one saying to the other, 'There is a camel ahead of us, as I judge—for I have not seen—that is blind of one eye and laden with two skin-bottles, one of which contains wine and the other oil, while two drivers attend it, one of them an Israelite, and the other a Gentile.' 'You perverse men,' said their master, 'how can you fabricate such a story as that?' The slave answered, and gave this as his reason, 'The grass is cropped only on one side of the track, the wine, that must have dripped, has soaked into the earth on the right, and the oil has trickled down, and may be seen on the left; while one of the drivers turned aside from the track to ease himself, but the other has not even left the road for the purpose.' Upon this the master stepped on before them in order to verify the correctness of their inferences, and found the conclusion true in every particular. He then turned back, and ... after complimenting the two slaves for their shrewdness, he at once gave them their liberty.""

Zadig
In chapter three of Voltaire's 1747 novel Zadig, there is an adaptation of The Three Princes of Serendip, this time involving, instead of a camel, a horse and a dog, which the eponymous Zadig is able to describe in great detail from his observations of the tracks on the ground. When he is accused of theft and taken before the judges, Zadig clears himself by recounting the mental process which allows him to describe the two animals he has never seen: ""I saw on the sand the tracks of an animal, and I easily judged that they were those of a little dog. Long, shallow furrows imprinted on little rises in the sand between the tracks of the paws informed me that it was a bitch whose dugs were hanging down, and that therefore she had had puppies a few days before.""
Zadig's detective work was influential. Cuvier wrote, in 1834, in the context of the new science of paleontology:

Today, anyone who sees only the print of a cloven hoof might conclude that the animal that had left it behind was a ruminator, and this conclusion is as certain as any in physics and in ethics. This footprint alone, then, provides the observer with information about the teeth, the jawbone, the vertebrae, each leg bone, the thighs, shoulders and pelvis of the animal which had just passed: it is a more certain proof than all Zadig's tracks.
T. H. Huxley, the proponent of Darwin's theories of evolution, also found Zadig's approach instructive, and wrote in his 1880 article ""The method of Zadig"":

What, in fact, lay at the foundation of all Zadig's arguments, but the coarse, commonplace assumption, upon which every act of our daily lives is based, that we may conclude from an effect to the pre-existence of a cause competent to produce that effect?
Edgar Allan Poe in his turn was probably inspired by Zadig when he created C. Auguste Dupin in ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue"", calling it a ""tale of ratiocination"" wherein ""the extent of information obtained lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation."" Poe's M. Dupin stories mark the start of the modern detective fiction genre. Émile Gaboriau and Arthur Conan Doyle were perhaps also influenced by Zadig.

Plot
A Brahmin (a member of the priesthood class) passes a tiger in a trap. The tiger pleads for his release, promising not to eat the Brahmin. The Brahmin sets him free but no sooner is the tiger out of the cage then he says he is going to eat the Brahmin, going back on his promise.  The Brahmin is horrified and tells the tiger how unjust he is. They agree to ask the first three things they encounter to judge between them.  The first thing they encounter is a tree, who, having suffered at the hands of humans, answers that the tiger should eat the Brahmin. Next a buffalo, exploited and mistreated by humans, agrees it is only just that the Brahmin should be eaten.  Finally they meet a jackal who, sympathetic to the Brahmin's plight, at first feigns incomprehension of what has happened and asks to see the trap. Once there he claims he still doesn't understand. The tiger gets back in the trap to demonstrate and the jackal quickly shuts him in, suggesting to the Brahmin that they leave matters thus.

Variants
There are more than a hundred versions of this tale  spread across the world. In some the released animal is a crocodile, in some a snake, a tiger and in others a wolf.
Folklorist Joseph Jacobs stated that the tale can be found in early Indian sources. Some variants are very old, going back at least to the Panchatantra or Fables of Bidpai and the Jataka tales. In Europe, it appeared some 900 years ago in the Disciplina Clericalis of Petrus Alphonsi, and later in the Gesta Romanorum and in the Directorium Vitae Humanae of John of Capua.
There are also modern illustrated versions of the tale, such as The Tiger, the Brahmin & the Jackal illustrated by David Kennett and The Tiger and the Brahmin illustrated by Kurt Vargo. Rabbit Ears Productions produced a video version of the last book, narrated by Ben Kingsley, with music by Ravi Shankar. The variant by Rabbit Ears Productions alters certain bits of the story, where the Brahmin travels alone to gain the opinion of others. An elephant is included as first of the three things (the latter two being the tree and water buffalo) that the Brahmin encounters.
A Shona version of this folktale was adapted in a popular Zimbabwean folksong Mutongi Gava Maenzanise. The variation is that its a leopard not a tiger and the next creature they see is a cow.

Early Indian versions
A tale concerning a talkative tortoise appears in the Buddhist scriptures as the Kacchapa Jataka.  In this version, it is framed by the account of a talkative king who finds in his courtyard a tortoise that has fallen from the sky and split in two. His adviser explains that this had come about as a result of talking too much. A tortoise had become friendly with two geese who promised to take it to their home in the Himalayas. They would hold a stick in their beaks while the tortoise would grasp it in his mouth, but he must be careful not to talk. Children below made fun of it during the journey and when it answered back it fell to its destruction. Jataka tales were a favourite subject for sculpture and this story is found as a bas relief on various religious buildings in India and Java. Often depicted as synoptic narratives, the episodes  encountered include the birds carrying the tortoise between them, its fall and its fate on reaching the Earth. In the 9th century Mendut temple in Java, for example, the birds and tortoise appear at top right, while on the ground huntsmen take aim with bows. Immediately below, the same three are preparing the fallen body for food.
As in the Mendut example, other versions of the story are depicted even in Buddhist contexts. In the Indian literary variation of the story in the Panchatantra, the tortoise and her friends live in a lake that is beginning to dry up. Pitying the future suffering of their friend, the geese suggest they fly off with her in the manner already described. On hearing the comments of people in the city they are passing, the tortoise tells them to mind their own business. After her fall in consequence, she is cut up and eaten.  The story was eventually included in the tales of Bidpai and travelled westward via translations into Persian, Syriac, Arabic, Greek, Hebrew and Latin. The last of these began to be translated into other European languages at the end of the Middle Ages. A still later retelling appears in the Hitopadesha, where the migration occurs because of the appearance of a fisherman. Cowherds below suggest that the flying tortoise would make a good meal and it falls while making an acid response.
An Italian version of Bidpai's fables was early translated into English by Thomas North under the title of The Morall Philosophie of Doni (1570). The story of the tortoise and the birds appears in a section illustrating the sentiment that 'a man hath no greater enemy than himself'. The French fabulist Jean de la Fontaine also found the story in an early digest of Bidpai's work and added it to his fables as La Tortue et les deux Canards (X.3). For him the story illustrates human vanity and imprudence. His tortoise tires of living in the same place and decides to travel. Two ducks offer to fly her to America but, while on their way, she hears people below describe her as 'the queen of tortoises' and shouts agreement. It is on this that Alexander Sumarokov appears to have based his Russian version, in which the ducks set out to carry the tortoise to France.
Travelling eastwards too, the story exists as a Mongolian folk tale with a different animal character.  In this variation, a frog is jealous of geese discussing their coming migration and complains that they are fortunate to be able to fly to a warmer climate in winter. The geese suggest the stick plan to the frog and they set off. The frog is so delighted with himself that he cannot resist shouting down to the frogs he is leaving behind and soon rejoins them disastrously.
A variation on this appears in the Russian author Vsevolod Garshin's story called ""The Traveler Frog"" (Лягушка-путешественница), which was adapted into a cartoon in 1965. There, the frog falls because it wants to tell those below that the traveling was its own idea, and not that of the ducks that carry him. Unlike in most variants, the frog falls into a pond and survives to boast of its supposed travels.

Versions in Aesop's Fables
There are two stories concerning a tortoise and various birds ascribed to Aesop, one in the Greek of Babrius and the other in the Latin of Phaedrus. In the Greek version, a tortoise yearns to see more of the Earth and persuades the eagle to fly up with it, promising in return 'all the gifts that come from the Eastern Sea'. Once they are above the clouds, the eagle drops it onto a mountaintop. The story was given the moral that one should be content with one's lot. It spread through Europe via Latin versions in the collections of Avianus and Odo of Cheriton. Thereafter it cross-fertilised with tellings of the Indian version of the fable. The tortoise's discontent is supplied to La Fontaine's fable from this source, as it is in Jefferys Taylor's poem The Tortoise.
Babrius gives no reason for the eagle's treachery; Avianus suggests that this was because the promised payment was not forthcoming. It is the uncertainty of life, into which treachery enters, that is the subject of the alternative version of the fable, told by Phaedrus as ""The Eagle and the Crow"" (2.6). It begins with the comment that 'no one is sufficiently well armed against the high and the mighty, and if there is a malicious advisor involved as well, then whoever falls victim to their criminal forces will be destroyed.' To illustrate this, he relates how an eagle has seized a tortoise but cannot eat it because of the protective shell. A passing crow advises the eagle to drop the animal 'from the starry heights' onto the rocks below, after which the two birds share its meat. By the time the story is retold by Walter of England an element of treachery has been added. The crow meets the frustrated eagle on the ground and advises it to soar up and drop its prey. Waiting behind by the rocks, the crow flies off with the fallen tortoise before the eagle can return.

African fables
An Igbo fable concerning the tortoise and the birds has gained wide distribution because it occurs in the famous novel Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe. The tortoise, who is a West African trickster figure, hears of a feast to be given by the sky-dwellers to the birds and persuades them to take him with them, winged in their feathers. There he tells the hosts that his name is 'All-of-you' and, when they provide the food with the assurance that 'This is for all of you', claims the entire feast. The enraged birds claim their feathers back and leave. Only the parrot will agree to take a message to the tortoise's wife to pull the bedding from his house and leave it on the ground. Instead the parrot tells her to bring out all the hard things so that when the tortoise jumps down its shell is broken. He survives, however, and the broken shell is glued together. This provides the explanation of why the tortoise's shell is so uneven. Much the same story is now claimed by the Swazi people and the Kikuyu.

Merged stories and adaptations
Some retellings of the tortoise fables are extended in such a way as to suggest that two stories have been merged into one. In the case of the African fable, the tortoise gets back to earth safely but the birds decide to play him a return trick. A feast is provided on the ground but it is announced that this can only be eaten by those whose claws are clean. The birds fly to the river and return to alight on their food but the tortoise, having to crawl, gets its feet dirty in returning and is sent back to try again. This time it is he who misses the feast.

In a Sri Lankan continuation of the Indian version of the fable, Ibba the tortoise similarly survives its fall to earth, only to get into the clutches of Nariya, the hungry jackal. Ibba suggests to Nariya that its shell will become soft if it is soaked in the river. At first Nariya keeps a paw on the shell but then Ibba persuades him that he is soft all over except for the dry patch under Nariya's paw. When the jackal raises it, Ibba swims to safety.
Other versions merge stories more seamlessly. A narration in the Uncle Remus tradition from the former slave population of South Carolina combines Aesop's fable of the discontented tortoise with an African cumulative tale. Brer Terrapin grumbles so much about being earth-bound that the animals conspire to have him carried up and dropped to his death. Miss Crow takes him first and when she grows tired he is transferred in turn to the back of a buzzard, a hawk and King Eagle. When the eagle will not listen to his pleas to take him back, the tortoise climbs down a thread he ties to the eagle's leg and so escapes his fate.
Joseph Jacobs similarly combines both fables of Aesop in his late retelling Here the eagle is carrying the tortoise to a new home and is reminded by the crow that it is good to eat, whereupon the eagle drops it on a sharp rock and the two birds make a feast of it. This synthetic version and the moral given it, 'Never soar aloft on an enemy's pinions', is often mistaken as authentic nowadays.

Source
French folklorist Emmanuel Cosquin claimed that the tale was first collected in 1833, from a washerwoman in Benares (Varanasi). An English language version of the tale, published in 1842, in The Asiatic Journal, claimed that the tale was ""a great favourite amongst the people of Hindustan"".

Synopsis
Tulisa, the beautiful daughter of a poor woodcutter (Nur Singh, or Nursingh), approaches a fountain, when she hears a voice, with a most strange proposition: ""Will you marry me?"". Not knowing whose voice it is, she pays no heed. The episode repeats a few times, and she tells her father of the curious happening.
Her would-be suitor is the Prince (or King) of Snakes, Basnak Dau, and promises riches to Tulisa's father, in exchange for his daughter's hand in marriage. She relents to the proposal and moves into a splendid palace. Tulisa marries the mysterious owner of the voice, under the condition that she may never see her husband when he comes to the bridal bed, at night, and that she must not receive any visitor.
At a certain point, she helps a squirrel, who tells her it will return the favor in the future. One day, an old lady (a creature named Sarkasukis, in disguise) was helped by Tulisa into the palace. In conversation with the mistress of the house, the old lady persuades Tulisa into asking the name of her husband. The fateful day arrives: when Tulisa asks him the question, he answers his name is ""Basnak Dau"", and suddenly the palace and the prince vanish, and leave her there, alone.
Tulisa returns to her parents, once again in poverty. One day, she receives the visit of the grateful squirrel, and learns of the mystery of her husband: he is the Prince of Snakes, dethroned by his own mother. If she succeeds in taking the eyes from the snake that coils around the Queen's neck, by a specific bird (the Huma bird), the Queen will be defeated and the true King restored.
Tulisa and the squirrel arrive at the palace of the Queen of the Serpents in order to fulfill the tasks assigned to her, thanks to the squirrel's help. First, she receives a crystal casket and must fill it with the perfume of a thousand flowers, but she is guided to a walled garden. Suddenly, a swarm of bees come buzzing into the garden, bringing the scent of flowers in bags. Next, Tulisa is to change a bag full of seeds into precious stones: many squirrels come, chew the seeds and transform them into precious stones.
The last quest is to steal the egg of the Huma bird, across a moat filled with poisonous snakes. Tulisa, with the help of bees and squirrels, manages to accomplish the task.

Translations
The tale was published in the West in German as Tulisa and Basnak Dau in Hermann Brockhaus' selections from the Somadeva Bhaṭṭa (Leipzig, 1843) and widely distributed through Ausland magazine (also 1843), The tale was also translated into German by Franz Hoffmann with the title Die Tochter des Holzfällers (Ein Märchen aus Hindostan). and Die Holzbauer Tochter.
It was also published in English in sources such as Household Tales from the East in The Dublin University Magazine in 1869. The tale also circulated in English with titles such as The Wood-Cutter's Daughter and the Mysterious Voice in the compilation The Ruby Fairy Book; The Wood-cutter's Daughter, in The Asiatic Journal; and Tulisa (A Hindoo Wonder Tale).
The tale was also translated to Czech and published in some editions of literary supplement Česká Včela (cs) in 1844 (in segmented format), with the title Drwoštěpowa dcera.
The tale was also translated into French as La Fille du Bûcheron, and the translator noted its ""remarkable analogy to the classic fable of Psyche"".

Analysis
Tale type
Later commentators saw common elements with Cupid and Psyche, as written by Apuleius in The Golden Ass. German philologist Ludwig Friedländer and Adolf Zinzow, for instance, treated The Tale of Tulisa as part of the ""Cupid and Psyche"" cycle of stories: heroine marrying supernatural or animal husband and losing him soon after, then having to search for him.
Folklorists Johannes Bolte and Jiri Polívka, in their Anmerkungen zu den Kinder- u. hausmärchen der brüder Grimm, Second Volume, listed the tale of Tulisa as a variant of German folktale The Singing, Springing Lark, collected by the Brothers Grimm, which is another variant of the Cupid and Psyche and Animal as Bridegroom tales. In the same vein, Folklorist Joseph Jacobs, in his book Europa's Fairy Book, mentioned the tale of Tulisa as having some sort of connection to the Graeco-Roman story, namely, their common motifs: the invisible husband; the violation of taboo; the mother-in-law's tasks; the wife's triumph at the end.
Danish folklore researcher Inger Margrethe Boberg also cited the tale of Tulisa in her study on the story of Cupid and Psyche.
Swedish scholar Jan-Öjvind Swahn considered the story of Tulisa close to his type A, which consists of tales wherein the heroine is forced to perform tasks for a witch or for her mother-in-law.

Motifs
In his work about Cupid and Psyche and other Animal as Bridegroom tales, Swedish scholar Jan-Öjvind Swahn identified that, in certain tales, the heroine causes her supernatural husband's disappearance by inquiring his name. Swahn named this motif The Name Taboo and surmised that it occurred ""primarily in India"".

Variants
Europe
Romani people
Transylvanian linguist Heinrich von Wlislocki collected and published a ""Zigeunermärchen"" from the Romani titled O thágár sápengré or Der Schlangenkönig (English: ""The Snake King""). He noted the great resemblance to the Indian story of Tulisa: a girl named Lolerme goes to the forest to fetch firewood and finds some pieces of gold on the ground. She picks one up and sees that they make a trail to a cavern entry. When she sits to rest, a giant snake with ""a head shining like gold"" and a red beard appears and introduces itself as the King of Snakes, who has fallen in love with Lolerme. The girl is frightened at first but the snake reveals it wants to give her mother great wealth. They marry and she lives a comfortable life, but her husband comes at night in human form. One day, a pregnant Lolerme helps an ugly old woman in front of the cave; she advises the girl who asks herself who the father of the child is, and about the youth that comes at night. She does so: the youth reveals himself to be the Snake King who the ugly old woman, a witch, cursed into serpent form. The youth curses his wife that she will not give birth, nor she will ever see him again, and vanishes. Desolate, Lolerme cries on the forest ground, until a giant cat approaches her and gives her the egg of the Tscharana bird (de), which, if roosted, will hatch a bird that can kill the witch and bring her husband back. Johannes Bolte and Jiří Polívka also listed Wislocki's tale as another variant of The Singing, Springing Lark. Danish scholar Inger Margrethe Boberg noted that the Lolerme story corresponded to Tulisa, although it lacked the long wandering of type 425A, and the tasks of type 425B.

Albania
In an Albanian tale titled Gjarpëri dhe e bija e mbretit (""Serpent and King's Daughter""), translated into Russian as ""Змей и королевская дочь"" (""Serpent and Royal Daughter"") and by Albanologist Robert Elsie as The Snake and the King's Daughter, a snake slithers into an old woman's basket and, after some time, asks the old woman to go to the king and request for the hand of his daughter in marriage. The king sets as condition three tasks for the future son-in-law, which the snake performs with a magic ring. The princess and the snake marry. On the nuptial night, he reveals he is a handsome prince named ""Swift"" (Shpejt/Shpeit) underneath the snakeskin and warns that she must not tell anything to her family. One day, the princess is invited to a wedding, and her husband appears lately at the occasion, to everyone's surprise. The princess reveals the man is her husband and he disappears. She goes on a quest for him with a pair of iron shoes, and passes by the houses of the Mother of the Sun, the Mother of the Moon and the Mother of the Winds. The Wind tells her her husband Swift is being held prisoner by a monster named Kulshedra, on an island across the sea, and she begs him to take her there. The Wind carries her across the sea to the island and the Kulshedra captures her, taking her to its lair. Secretly, Swift lets his ring fall into a jug she is washing and she recognizes her husband is there. The next day, the Kulshedra forces the girl to sweep some parts of the floor and not sweep the others, and to fill two cauldrons with her tears - both tasks accomplished with her husband's advice: for the first task, the princess is advised to sweep the floor with breadcrust; for the second task, she is told by Shpejt to fill the cauldrons with water and sprinkle salt over it. Seeing that the princess fulfilled the tasks, the Kulshedra then plans to eat the prince, so Shpejt devises a plan to get rid of the monster: he disguises himself as a poor man and chops wood in the nearby forest. The Kulshedra approaches and inquires the man, who answers that he is fashioning a coffin for Swift. The man convinces the Kulshedra to take a look inside the coffin, shoves the creature inside and burns it to ashes. Now freed from the Kulshedra's grasp, he takes the princess home with him, and they live happily.

Romania
Author Iuliu Traian Mera published in magazine Convorbiri Literare a Romanian variant titled Crăişorul Şărpilor or Crăişorul Şerpilor (""Prince Serpent""). In this tale, an old peasant couple lives in the edge of the village, in the forest. They live by scavenging from the forest. One day, the old man finds a little snake in the forest and brings it home. His wife decides to take care of it with milk. Time passes; the little snake refers to the couple as its parents and, when he is old enough, decides to choose a bride: the daughter of the Imparatul Verde (""Green Emperor""). The snake's mother goes to the Green Emperor to ask for her hand in marriage, but the Green Emperor sets three tasks: first, to build a palace over the poor couple's hut; second, to build a bridge between their palaces, with gardens by its side, with singing little birds and a bell on each bird; third, to have, under the bridge, water sweet as honey and as crystalline, whose waves crash at the Green Emperor's palace, and where every fish swims. Crăişorul Şărpilor, as a snake, fulfills the tasks and gets to marry the Green Emperor's daughter. After they enter the wedding chambers, the snake takes off its skin to become a handsome man, with golden hair, face fair as milkfoam, and dark eyes. Crăişorul Şărpilor remains human by night and wears the snakeskin by day. This goes on for some time, until the Green Emperor wants to invite nobles from all around the world for a banquet. Crăişorul Şărpilor worries about being a snake during the celebration, but he takes off the snakeskin and goes with his wife. Meanwhile, the Green Emperor's wife, the Empress, finds the snakeskin and throws it in an oven - the story explains that the snake prince's curse was about to end, had the snakeskin not been destroyed. During the banquet, Crăişorul Şărpilor senses the snakeskin was burned, and talks to his wife that he needs to disappear, and he will only be found in the Isle of Snakes (""ostrovul şărpilor""), though the path is dangerous and even more dangerous is the Isle, filled with snakes and dragons. He disappears, leaving the princess alone; his palace, the bridge and the sea also vanishing with him. The Green Emperor's daughter begins her long quest. On the road, she helps a little bird, a hare and a deer, which promise to help her in the future. She then reaches the lair of the Mama Padurii (""Mother of the Forest""), deep in a dark forest. Mama Padurii promises to guide the princess, in exchange for a year of servitude under her. The princess's task is to watch over her hens, but one of them disappears after the princess dozes off. She summons the little bird, the hare and the deer to help her locate the lost hen. The hen disappears again on the next two days, but her animal helpers aid her. Now free of Mama Padurii, the creature tells the princess to cross a dangerous valley. The deer helper advises the princess to seek the help of Sfânta Duminecă (Holy Sunday), who lives in a hut. Sfânta Duminecă asks the princess to work for her for another year, just herding the sheep. With an easier task, the princess performs her chores. For her kindness, Sfânta Duminecă tells that a river  marks the threshold between their world and the Isle of Snakes, and that her husband, Crăişorul Şărpilor, takes a bath every morning by sunrise in the river. Armed with this knowledge, the princess keeps walking for another nine years, through nine lands and nine seas, until, one day, by sunrise, she sees her husband taking a bath in the river and goes to him. She embraces him, but he warns her that his family (four sisters and his mother) are terrible, snake-like creatures that will kill her. She decides to remain with him, despite the danger. The snake-like family returns and hisses at their guest, who Crăişorul Şărpilor introduces as his human wife. Crăişorul Şărpilor's mother begins to devise a way to kill her. On the first day, she orders the princess to bake six pies for them, three unbaked and three baked; on the second day, to fill a bottle with her tears. Crăişorul Şărpilor helps her on both tasks. As a third task, the princess is to get a sieve from a draconic neighbour. Crăişorul Şărpilor gives her a ring and tells the princess to use it as the draconic neighbour goes to the kitchen to sharpen her teeth. In the neighbour's house, the princess places the ring to answer for her, gets the sieve and escapes. Finally, Crăişorul Şărpilor and his wife decide to escape from his snake family in a ""Magic Flight"" sequence: they shapeshift into a melon orchard (the princess) and an orchard keeper (him), then into a mill (the princess) and a miller (him), next into a pair of birds pecking corn on the road (both), and lastly into an elm tree (the princess) and ivy (him). Crăişorul Şărpilor's mother comes to the tree, recognizes it as both her son and his wife, but, not knowing which is which, lets them be. Crăişorul Şărpilor and his wife go back to the Green Emperor's palace and live out their days in peace and happiness.

Sri Lanka
Author Henry Parker collected a Sinhalese language tale from Sri Lanka with the title Rāksayāgeyi Kumārikāwageyi Katantaraya, translated as The Story of the Rākshasa and the Princess. In this tale, a king and a queen have a daughter, the princess. While divining her future, they learn that her future spouse is a Rakshasa. Some time later, the king and the queen die, leaving the princess on her own. Meanwhile, the Rakshasa uses his powers to summon the princess's palace to his location (""wishes the palace away"", in the text). It happens thus. The princess leaves the palace and meets the Rakshasa, who takes her in to his mother, a Rakshasi. One day, the Rakshasi tells the princess she is going out to eat some human bodies, and orders the girl to bring seven large pots of water, seven large bundles of firewood, boil and pound seven paelas of paddy-rice, plaster cow dung in seven houses, and have the Rakshasi's bathwater ready. After she leaves, the princess begins to cry, when the Rakshasa appears to her and offers to do the chores in her place. Next, the Rakshasi orders the princess to pay a visit to the Rakshasi's younger sister and take from there a box. The Rakshasa advises the princess to get the box near the door and escape while his aunt is distracted blowing the fire in the hearth. The princess follows his orders and takes the box; the Rakshasi's younger sister chases after her, but fails to catch her. Thirdly, the Rakshasi prepares her son's wedding, and orders the princess to set the tables and chair and prepare the food. After the Rakshasa's marriage, the Rakshasi asks her daughter-in-law to eat the human princess, but somehow she cannot do so. Back to the Rakshasa and the princess, they enter her palace and teleport away.

In a Sangir tale collected with the title Bion Gansaļangi Dĕduan Donan Sampakang and translated by Nicolaus Adriani as Verhaal von Gansaļangi en Donan Sampakang (English: ""Tale about Gansaļangi and Donan Sampakang""), a king and queen have nine daughters. One day, the princesses go to the river to with their fishing nets to catch some shrimp. While they are fishing, a fish named Lumbake jumps into the first princess's net, who rejects him. The fish jumps into the other princesses' nets until the ninth princess catches him. The fish begs to be spared, and the ninth princess places him a pond. Time passes, and the fish asks the princess to bathe with him in the river. The fish swims upstream until he reaches a place where he takes off the piscine skin, revealing he is a human youth underneath it. The princess watches his transformation, takes the fish skin and burns it. The youth goes to look for his skin and does not find it; he then utters a magical command for golden garments and a golden horse to appear to him. He takes the golden horse and rides past the eight princesses. He then summons a house of glass and 100 slaves to appear before him. The tale then explains the prince is named Gansalangi, and the ninth princess Donan Sampakang. The prince then tells Donan Sampakang she is his wife in the earthly realm, but he has another in the celestial realm, and he is going to visit his parents, the king and queen of heaven. Gansalangi goes alone to Heaven and meets his mother, who marries him to another woman, to his great sadness. Later, Gansalangi descends to earth again and meets his human wife, telling her he will go back home the next day. Donan Sampakang offers to go with him, despite his objections. On the way up, Donan Sampakang sees devils and creatures screaming in a fire. When they arrive in Heaven, Gansalangi warns the princess his mother is a killer who walks with a dagger in hand, and, to protect herself, the princess has to say she is but a slave. Gansalangi's mother comes and questions her son about the woman he brought with him, and deduces she is a princess, due to her clothes and golden-pointed hair. She then scatters millet around the house, and the princess cries. The princess, however, utters a command for the grains to fill a jar. Next, the Queen of Heaven gives Donan Sampakang a white tunic, which is to be washed until it turns to a red colour. Prince Gansalangi utters an incantation to summon the bidadaris to help his human wife. The prince and the princess at last wish to be home, and live in happiness together. Jan-Öjvind Swahn classified the tale as his type A, which corresponds to the Graeco-Roman myth of Cupid and Psyche: supernatural bridegroom and tasks for mother-in-law.
Author J. A. T. Schwarz collected from the Tomtenboan a tale titled Sisil an doro’ i Anak tuama i Tjolano a langit wo si Wawu’ am bawo in tana, translated into Dutch as Verhaal van den Koningszoon in den hemel en de Koningsdochter op de aarde (English: ""Tale about the Prince in Heaven and the Princess on Earth""). Folklorist Paul Hambruch translated into German as Die Erzählung vom himmlischen Prinzen und der irdischen Prinzessin (""Tale of the Heavenly Prince and Earthly Princess""), and sourced it from Minahasa. In the tale, a prince comes down from the Heavens in the shape of a goat, and asks a human king if any of his daughters agrees to marry him. The two elder princess refuse to marry the goat, while the youngest agrees. They celebrate their marriage and move out to another house, where she places a basin of water near the bed so she can wash her face. The next morning, the princess wakes up and sees that someone has used the water in the basin, and questions her maidservant, who does not know anything about it. On the day after, while the princess is asleep, the maidservant notices that the goat is washing his face in the basin, and wakes the princess up. The girl goes to embrace her husband. They live like this for a while, until one day, the goat (in human form) tells the princess he will go fishing, and wears the caprine skin again. While he is away, the princess is visited by her sisters and falls for their cunning tricks: she is told to drop a basin of scalding water on him so he will love her better. She follows their suggestion, but the goat husband questions her actions. The next time, the princess's sisters advise her to drop a large knife on him as soon as he comes back, for the same reason as before. The goat goes home and is welcomed with a large knife dropping on him. Feeling mistreated by his wife, he tells her he will go back to his celestial father, and departs. The princess follows him until they reach a mountain, where she rests by his side. After she falls asleep, the goat calls out to the mountain, and continues on his journey. The princess wakes up and follows the goat again, until she falls asleep on his arms. While the girl is asleep, the goat calls out to a ""ricebird"", and walks away from his wife. Their third stop is a river called ""Blackening Water"" (""Zwartmakende water"", in the Dutch translation), where he bathes with his wife. The goat then explains he is going back to his celestial realm and is taking the princess with him, but, once they arrive there, he will pass her off as a maidservant, since his parents do not approve of his marriage to a mortal. It happens thus: in the celestial realm, the prince's mother asks her son about the human girl, and he says she is a maidservant. As they prepare for the prince's wedding, the queen scatters mustard seeds all over the floor and orders the princess to gather them. The princess goes to her husband for help, and he summons a colony of ants to gather the seeds. Next, the queen gives the princess a basket and orders her to fetch water with it. The prince tells her to go to the water margin and says the prince commanded the eels to come and fill the basket to make it impermeable. The princess brings the basket with water. Lastly, the queen orders the princess to hold torches with resin during the prince's wedding night. Twice, the prince sees that his human wife's hands are hurt by the melting resin, but heals her with a spell. The third time, the prince takes his human wife and both return to Earth. Schwarz noted that the Totemboan tale found a ""parallel"" in the Sangir story of ""Gansalangi and Donan Sampakang"". Jan-Öjvind Swahn classiified the tale as his type A, which corresponds to the Graeco-Roman myth of Cupid and Psyche: supernatural bridegroom and tasks for mother-in-law.

Summary
Madanakamaraja Katha
The character features in stories compiled in the work Madanakamaraja Katha.

First story
Author Natesa Sastri published a translation of Madanakamaraja Katha as The Dravidian Nights Entertainment, which contains two stories about the turtle (tortoise) prince. The first one is the tale from the fourth day, which Sastri translated as Faith Is Always Rewarded, while Dravidologist Kamil Zvelebil translated it as The Tortoise-Prince.
In this tale, King Venkataja, from the city of Mallikârjunapurî, is married to a wife who has not borne him a son. He divorces her, places the former queen in a separate pavilion next to the palace, and marries a second time. The new queen also does not bear him children. The King searches for answers to this problem, and Mahêsvara and the Sûlapânin Isa help him by giving the king a magical mango that he should give to his queen. The king gives the mango to the second queen; she drinks the juice and discards the rest. The first queen's maid hears about the magic mango, finds the discarded seed, and gives it to the first queen. The first queen gives part of the seed to her maid, and they both eat of the magic mango. Consequently, the second queen gives birth to twin boys, the maid to a son, and the first queen to a tortoise. The narrative says that the tortoise son was no ordinary turtle, but a beautiful prince born in Paramêsvara's favour. One night, while spying to find out why food is mysteriously disappearing, the queen sees a human child come out of the tortoise shell; he has been sneaking out of his shell at night and eating rice. When he has gone, she smashes the shell and goes to sleep. When the boy tries to find his shell and sees it destroyed, he wakes his mother. He explains that he needed the shell, and asks her to have a box made to replace the shell. She apologizes for breaking the shell, and consents to his request for a box.
Sometime later, the king instructs his twin sons to travel north, to the mountain Himayagiri (""the frosty mountain""), and bring back the maiden of the mountain to be their father's third wife. Meanwhile, their half-brother, the tortoise prince, using his gift of Jñanâdrishti (a sort of cosmic awareness or omniscience), learns of the quest and knows their endeavor will fail if he does not go with them. He puts some charcoal on his skin to disguise himself and joins the twin princes on their journey. The twin princes do not recognise him as their brother, but think him to be a mountaineer, and they are glad to let him travel with them because he amuses them with stories. 
They reach a red-coloured stream and the twin princes drink the water, but the tortoise prince knows that the stream is leftover water from the princess's bath. So he takes his two half-brothers, one in each arm, and leaps from one side of the stream to the other. The princess witnesses this, and having declared that she will marry the man who can cross the stream without stepping in it, she tells her father of the incident and prepares to marry the extraordinary man. The tortoise prince agrees, with the condition that he still wears the black soot at the ceremony. They marry, and the tortoise prince reveals his royal origins to his wife and advises her to go to Himayagiri if he does not return within 28 days.
The tortoise prince (still in his disguise) and the twin princes continue their journey. They come to another city, where a princess has devised a test for suitors: a man at the city entrance gives a pie to travelers and says they must find firewood, leaf, and oil, and return the pie. The tortoise prince deduces the answer and gives the man a sesamum plant (stem for firewood, its leaves as leaves, and its seed for oil). The princess tells her father, and he arranges the wedding the same day. After the wedding, the prince tells his story and tells her to go to Himayagiri if he does not return after an appointed time.
In a third city, a Pândita (learned lady) sets a task for her suitors: she will present a book of her writings on philosophy to the suitor, and he must write a satisfactory comment on it. The black prince succeeds and, with her father's consent, marries the learned lady. After the wedding, he tells her his story, the purpose of his journey, and that she should go to Himayagiri if he does not return within six days. In turn, his third wife tells him how to find the Himayagiri maiden: he should circle around the mountain and touch a certain creeper plant, which will carry him to the princess. Then he should prostrate before her and call her his mother, and inform her that his father wants her for his bride. The tortoise prince arrives at Himayagiri and sees that his two brothers have stopped at its base, uncertain of how to proceed. The prince does everything his third wife has advised, the princess consents to go with him, and they come down the creeper. The prince then realises that he forgot his golden scimitar up on the mountain and goes back to get it. At that moment, his two brothers, jealous of his successes throughout their journey, cut the rope, and he falls to his death.
The twin princes bring the Himayagiri maiden to their father. However, she feels bad about what happened to the tortoise prince, and resolves to make a penance in hopes that he can come back to life. She asks the king to postpone the wedding for six months because she must make a penance (without telling him why), and the king consents and makes the necessary arrangements for her rituals. Meanwhile, the tortoise prince's three wives go to the place where he died and weep over his shattered body. The third wife, the learned lady, knows a way to revive him, so they gather his remains, perform prayer and other rituals, and resurrect him. The quartet visits the home kingdoms of each wife and receive presents and dowries. Then, the prince procures a house a short distance from his town for his wives to wait in, while he goes home to tell his mother of his adventures. The tortoise prince's mother is delighted at seeing her son again, and after hearing his story, goes to meet his wives. She is well-pleased with them, and brings them home to her own palace.
After six months, the Himayagiri maiden wishes to know if the tortoise prince is alive, and devises a way to find out. She asks the king for one last item before her wedding: a golden lotus flower from beyond the seven oceans, saying to her prospective husband that if his twin sons brought her back, surely they can fetch the flower. However, she knows that only the tortoise prince can get the flower.
The twin princes go to the ocean shore and remember, with sorrow and regret, their treachery towards their extraordinary companion. The black prince appears behind them and offers to get the flower, having been informed of their mission by his omniscience, and instructed in how to complete the task by his third wife. He takes seven pebbles and uses each of them to drain the seven oceans; He then reaches the sacred waters called Akhilâdudakoti Brahmânda, chants a summoning command, gives a Rakshasa a note from his third wife, jumps on a crocodile and gets the golden lotus.
The tortoise prince and his half-brothers deliver the flower to the Himayagiri maiden. She finally consents to the wedding and asks the king to send invitations to all the lords of the world and to have the king's first wife, her son, and the son's three wives give her in marriage. The king visits his first wife and is surprised to see the son - his son - and the three princesses, but does not want to appear ignorant, so he conceals his surprise and invites them all to the wedding. On the wedding day, when kings from all parts of the world are assembled, the Himayagiri maiden tells them what she knows of the story of the tortoise prince, of his mother, his father, and his journey. The tortoise prince then tells the part of the story that the princess does not know, of how he obtained the golden lotus. The king embraces the tortoise prince as his son and marries the Himayagiri maiden. The prince forgives his half-brothers' misdeeds, and they all live peacefully.

Second story
Another tale of the turtle prince from the same compilation is the seventh story, which Sastri translated as True Merit Shall Be Rewarded and Zvelebil as How a prince who was a tortoise married the minister's daughter. In this tale, in the northern city of Amarâvati, king Alakiyasingarâja and his minister Subhamantrî are good friends, and promise to marry their children to each other. In time, the queen gives birth to a tortoise and the minister's wife to a daughter. The king laments for his tortoise son, but the animal prince insists he goes through with the marriage promise. The minister is reluctant to a marriage, but his eldest daughter says she will marry one that brings her the parijata flower, whatever his physical form.
The tortoise prince's father throws him in water and he begins journey, swimming across seven oceans until he reaches Udayagiri, the mountain where the Sun rises every morning, where he salutes the Sun-god, Sûrya-bhagavan, and his charioteer, Aruna, as they begin their daily journey. The Sun questions the presence of the tortoise there, and the prince explains he wishes to know why he was born an animal in this life, chanting 1,008 praises to the deity. The Sun-god replies the tortoise shape is a penance for a misdeed in a previous life, and, at the tortoise's request, blesses him with the ability to assume a human state at will. In human shape, the now human tortoise prince is direct to a sage, then to two other sages. From the third sage, the prince is advised to steal the clothes of the divine maidens (Apsaras) that come to bathe that come to bathe in a pond in the temple, then force her to fetch the parijata flower for him. It happens thus, and the prince convinces the Apsara to help him. She regains her dress and flies back to the divine realm, where she commissions a Vînâ guitar from the divine carpenter, takes a basket full of parijata flowers and dishes, and returns to the prince.
The Apsara and the prince have a meal, and she explains the guitar can summon him and the wonderful dishes. The prince leaves and passes by the sages' houses on the way back. The third sage wishes to have the magic guitar and trades it for a self-attacking club that can decimate armies. As the prince leaves, the club begins to talk and says it wants to beat its previous owver, which the prince lets it do. The third sage is beaten to death. The same event happens to the other two sages: the second sage trades a magic purse for the guitar and the first a pair of teleporting sandals; the prince kills them with the club and retrieves the magic guitar. At last, the prince summons the Apsara and dines with her, explains he will deliver the flower to the minister's daughter and marry her, but he will give the other magical objects to the divine maiden for safekeeping. He assumes his tortoise shape and swims back to his father's kingdom to present the minister's daughter with the flowers.
The minister's daughter receives the flowers and marries the tortoise prince, to her dismay, while her sisters marry human husbands. One night, while his human wife is asleep, the prince crawls to the shore, to the place where the divine maiden hid the objects (a baniyan tree), and commands the club to take off his tortoise shell. He summons the maiden with the guitar and they have a meal. One day, the prince's brothers-in-law decide to go hunting, and the tortoise prince joins with them. The prince rides the lame horse to the banyan tree, takes off the tortoise shell to become human, dons the sandals and the club, and spreads divine ashes over his body. His brothers-in-law see him, mistake him for a god, and dine with him. The prince pretends to bless the pair and asks for the tips of their little fingers in return. It happens thus, and both cut off the tips of their little fingers to give him. On a second hunt, the prince in god-like disguise demands from his brothers-in-law their rings.
Some time later, an enemy army marches to conquer their city, and the tortoise prince is the only one who can help his brothers-in-law. He orders his wife to prepare seven tubs of hot water when he returns. He rides as a tortoise, retreats to a hidden place, and returns as a human with the magic club to vanquish the enemy army, to the admiration of his brothers-in-law. Afterwards, he dons the tortoise shell and returns to his wife.
He bids his wife leave the room, takes off the tortoiseshell, and enters the bath. His wife, spying on the other side of the door, sees his human form and swoons. When she wakes up, she breaks the tortoise shell. After the prince exits the bath, he demands his tortoise shell back, but his wife explains she smashed it to pieces. The prince excuses her and drops onto the bed out of sheer exhaustion. The minister's daughter rushes to her parents to show them the true form of her husband. The king and queen also see their son's human form. The brothers-in-law recognize him as the god-like bring they met in the forest. The prince and the minister's daughter remarry and he assumes the throne.

Henry Parker's tales
First version
Author Henry Parker collected a homonymous tale from Sri Lanka titled The Turtle Prince (Sinhalese: Ibi Kumārayā). In this tale, two noblemen live in two houses in the same city. Their respective wives bear seven children each: one gives birth to seven girls, and the other to six boys and a turtle. Both men decide to have their sons and daughters marry amongst themselves, but there is the problem of the seventh couple: how can a human woman marry a turtle? The nobleman eventually relents and authorizes his daughter's marriage. Sometime later, the king of the same city announces that whoever brings him the Fire Cock (Gini kukulā, or fire[-coloured] cock) from the Land of the Rakshasas shall receive the kingdom. The turtle prince asks his mother to go to the king and offer his services. The turtle prince cooks a bit of rice and starts the journey. On the road, he hides behind some trees and takes off his ""turtle jacket"". He takes shelter with three old women in his quest for the ""Jewelled Cock"", and the women all warn him that many have tried and failed in this mission. Since he insists on soldiering on, the widow-mothers teach him magic and give him magic objects to create obstacles for the Rakshasas, should they pursue him after he gets the bird. The prince gets the bird and uses the magical items to hinder the pursuit of Rakshasas. He goes back to the trees, puts the turtle jacket on, and returns to the kingdom with the Fire Cock. Having succeeded, the turtle prince takes off his jacket and goes to hear the Bana with his wife. The wife, noticing the man is her husband, rushes home to burn the turtle jacket and keep her husband in human form permanently. Parker sourced this tale from a tom-tom beater in Hiriyala, North Western Province, Sri Lanka.

Second version
In another tale, The Prince who received the Turtle Shell, in a certain kingdom, the prince's teachers notice that he fails to learn what they teach him, and thus inform the king. His brothers prove to be more skilled than him, and dejected, the prince abandons the kingdom. He takes shelter with a cowherd and his wife. While he grazes the cows, a goddess shows compassion to him and gives him a turtle shell and a magic spell. With it, he can turn into a turtle and vice versa. He goes to another kingdom and becomes the adopted son of a flower mother. He learns the seventh princess is still single and decides to court her in both human and turtle forms. The princess brings the turtle to her palace; he takes off his disguise and tells her his story. With time, she becomes pregnant and the king questions her about it. She tells it is the flower mother's son, so he delivers her to him and banishes her from the palace. Sometime later, the king organizes a feast with a hunt and sends six of his sons-in-law to take part in it. The seventh princess tells her husband and he joins the hunting party in ragged clothes. Out of sight, he changes into a prince, kills the animals, takes their tongues, and returns to his shabby disguise. The brothers-in-law present the animals to the king, but the seventh prince shows up to take the credit for his deed and shows the tongues to the king.

Third version
In another published tale, Concerning a Royal Princess and a Turtle, a king and a minister, due to their deep friendship and trust, promise to betroth their eldest children to each other. The king's wife give birth to a girl, and the minister's wife gives birth to a turtle. The time comes for their wedding vows, and the princess refuses to marry the turtle. However, she says, if they insist on continuing with the marriage, she wants the turtle to first bring her a Sūriya-kāntā flower. The turtle goes to the place where the sun (Surya) rises and places his head on the ground in front of the sun's chariot wheel. Surya gives the turtle the ability to change into a man at will and directs him to the trail of three Dēwatāwās. The Dēwatāwās point to him a hidden lake where ""Virgin Women"" (Kanniyā-Striyō) or Sun-maidens (Sūriyā-kāntāwō) bathe, and he must steal their clothes and force them to give him the flower. The youth gets the flower and is also given a cudgel and a magic lute. He returns to the turtle shell and marries the princess, while her sisters marry human princes. One day, the six princes go on a seven-day hunt, and the turtle prince, still in turtle form, asks his wife to bring him a mount and a sword. He receives a mule and a short sword and joins his brothers-in-law on the hunt. He hides in the forest, takes off the turtle shell, and summons the Virgin Women to give him a horse and a better sword. The prince, in human shape, hunts the best game for himself. After a while, he meets the six other princes and agrees to give them six dead deer, in exchange for a piece of cloth from each. The turtle prince changes back into a turtle and presents a dead rat as the catch of the day. This goes on for the next few days: the prince exchanges his game for the princes' rings. When the seven-day hunt ends, the turtle prince asks his wife to prepare a hot bath for him; the princess sees him coming out of the shell and burns it. At last, the prince, now fully human, presents his father-in-law with proof that he was the one who hunted the best game for him.

Venkataswami's version
In a tale collected by author M. N. Venkataswami with the title The Nymph of Wire Hill, a king has two wives, but no sons. He goes to the forest and meets an anchorite who directs him to a mango tree. The king takes the mangoes and brings them home to his wives. The younger wife eats the fruits, leaving the peels and cots. The senior wife eats the mango kernels. Months later, the younger wife gives birth to twin sons, and the senior wife to a tortoise.
The senior wife accepts her lot in life and cares for the tortoise as her son. One day, she and a servant notice that some food has been disappearing from their palace. It turns out that her tortoise son is indeed human, for he leaves the tortoiseshell in human form, eats the food, and goes to Davendraloka to learn, just as his half-brothers are learning from a pandit. The senior wife discovers the empty shell, notices her son is human after all, and smashes it. Losing his turtle shell, he asks his mother to fashion him a box to cover himself with.
Sometime later, the king becomes ill with longing for the ""Nymph of the Wire Hill"", and his sons decide to bring her to their father to be his next wife. The tortoise son, now human, tells his mother he must join his brothers since they cannot get the Nymph by themselves. His mother applies some colirium to his face and his appearance darkens, so his brothers cannot recognize him.
He joins his brothers and they begin their quest. Their first stop is a kingdom whose princess has declared she will marry the one who can jump across a large stream. The first princess tells her father she will marry the dark boy who accompanies the twin princes. He tells he is only an ascetic without much to his name. They marry and the prince spends some time with his wife, asking her how to get to Wire Hill. Before he departs, he gives her a Mangalasustram flower as a token of life.
Their next stop is another kingdom, where a princess has issued a challenge: who can bring her all the necessary provisions for life in a pie? The tortoise prince goes to the bazaar, buys a unit of all grains in a bundle, and produces some ghi on a leaf and a faggot of wood. The second princess marries the man who brought the provisions, which are the correct answer to her riddle. Before he departs, he gives the princess a flower a token of life.
The prince's third stop is another kingdom, where their princess has issued a proclamation that she will marry anyone who can decipher a drawing of the Devendraloka with some inscriptions underneath. The tortoise prince deciphers the drawing and the inscriptions and marries for the third time. While talking to his new wife, she tells him that the on the southern part of Wire Hill there is a wire that he can use to reach the Nymph. Before he departs, he plants a lily as a token of life and instructs her to go to Wire Hill in case the flower blackens.
At last, the three princes arrive at Wire Hill. The twin princes complain to each other about their companion's marital successes and plot against him. The tortoise prince climbs the wire and meets the Nymph. After spending some time with him, the Nymph climbs down the wire but asks the youth to bring her her parrot cage. The tortoise prince descends the wire with the bird cage, but the twin princes cut the wire and he falls to his death.
Each of the princesses notices that the token of life changes color and runs to Wire Hill, the first princess meeting the second and both meeting the third one. The trio reach Wire Hill and see the tortoise prince's bones scattered, and the wives gather up the bones. The youngest wife goes to a cistern, bathes seven times, and enters a meditation state, extending the folds of her garments to receive something. Parwati heeds her lamentations and Parmeshwara gives her a rod to use on the tortoise prince to revive him. The youngest princess uses the rod on her husband and returns it to the cistern.
The tortoise prince, now revived, takes his three wives, passes by each of their kingdoms to gather presents and amass a large retinue, and returns to his kingdom. He asks his three wives to meet and greet his mother, bathe her feet, and offer her a seat.
Meanwhile, the twin princes get the credit for bringing the Nymph of Wire Hill to their father. Still thinking of the youth who came to her at Wire Hill, she tells her husband-to-be, the king, that before their wedding she needs some Cobra-Lillies, found only at the end of seven and seven-fourteen seas, beyond the sea of milk. The tortoise prince notices his brothers are being sent for the Cobra-Lillies, and asks his third and youngest wife for advice. She gives him a letter and some seeds and explains what to do: he is to cast the seeds into the sea, which will open a dry passage for him; he is to walk all the way until he sees a turtle; he is to give the turtle the letter; the turtle will return and take him to its king, the Lord of Serpents.
The tortoise prince follows his third wife's instructions and finds the turtle, giving it the letter. The turtle takes the prince to the court of the Lord of Serpents, who greets him. He marries him to his daughter, the ""celestial Swain"", gives him some Cobra-Lillies, and sends both his daughter and son-in-law back on the turtle. The twin princes arrive on the beach and see the tortoise prince and his new wife coming. The prince agrees to give them the Cobra-Lillies.
Seeing that the task is fulfilled, the Nymph of Wire Hill agrees to set a date for her marriage with to the king and invites a grand assembly of nobles and monarchs. However, she notices the absence of the senior wife and her son. The king takes issue with this information, since, in his mind, only his younger wife bore him any sons. The Nymph of Wire Hill scolds her fiancé and tells him that his twin sons did nothing heroic, and the tortoise prince did everything. The king spits at the twin sons and banishes them, and embraces his senior wife, their tortoise son, and the tortoise's four wives. Venkataswami classified the tale as a ""Tortoise Prince Type"", and, according to his preface, the tale was provided by his cousin named M. Venkatamma, from Bezwada.

Ramanujan's version
Indian scholar A. K. Ramanujan collected and published a tale from Kannada with the title The Turtle Prince. In this tale, a king and his minister have no children, so they consult a holy man, who tells them that if devote themselves to Siva, their wives will become pregnant. Thus, both men agree to wed their children to each other. In time, the queen gives birth to a turtle and the minister's wife to a girl. Years later, the king worries about marrying the turtle son to the minister's daughter, so, bid by his animal son, consults with the minister and his daughter. The girl says she will marry the man who can bring her the celestial parijata flower.
With some help from his father, the turtle prince begins his journey and swims to Udaya mountain, where he prays to the sun god. The deity himself appears before him, explains that the prince's animal shape is penance for a misdeed in a past life, and transforms him into a handsome human prince. Continuing on his journey, the prince, now in human form, meets three sages on the way and is guided to the temple of the elephant-faced god, where celestial maidens come down to earth to bathe, so the prince should steal one of the girls' saris and force her to help him to find the parijata flowers that grow in the celestial realm. It happens thus and the celestial maiden brings back the flowers. She also gives the prince a flute that can summon her. The prince makes his way back to the sages, who each want the magic flute in exchange for a gift they have: the first a wand that can beat one's enemies, the second a sack that grants the owner whatever they wish for, and the third a pair of teleporting sandals. The prince trades the flute for each, commands the wand to beat up the sages, and retrieves the flute.
The prince returns to his kingdom, hides the magical items and prays to the Sun God to become a turtle again. Since he fulfilled the minister's daughter's request, he marries the girl, while her younger sisters marry human princes. Some time later, the princes go on a hunt, and the tortoise wishes to join them. The turtle's wife, who knows of the mockery she endures, prepares him for the hunt. Out of sight, the turtle takes off his shell and becomes human, then fights some tigers. His brothers-in-law meet the prince (""they saw the turtle""), who do not recognize him. The human turtle prince agrees to a deal: the tigers in exchange for the left half of their mustaches. A deal is made, and the prince returns to turtle form.
Later that night, while the minister's daughter is asleep, the prince takes off his shell, undresses his wife, caresses her body, and goes back to being a turtle. The next morning, she notices that someone came in the night, and decides to investigate. The next night, his wife discovers his human form and wants his charade to end. The next morning, the brothers-in-law go to court to take the credit for killing the tigers, but the turtle appears, takes off the shell, and becomes a man. He reveals he is the one responsible for the deed and shows the mustaches as proof. He is then crowned king.

Other publications
Zacharias P. Thundy published a tale from Kadar that he titled Beauty and the Beast: a turtle is born to a king, and before he marries the minister's daughter, is sent on a quest for the parijata flower.
Stuart Blackburn collected a Tamil tale he titled The Turtle Prince: a raja and a minister promise to marry their children. When a turtle is born to the raja and six girls to the minister, the eldest daughter asks for her turtle suitor to get her a parijatam flower. The turtle prince goes to the sun god Surya, who grants him a boon: he can transform into human form and hold the turtle shell in his hand. With the directions of an ascetic, he steals the garments of a Kannimar to convince her to get him the flower. The Kannimar gives him the flower, and a vina in case he wants to summon her help anywhere. He also obtains a magic wand (baton) a magic bag and magic sandals. Assuming turtle form again, he returns home and marries the minister's eldest daughter. One day, he asks for a blind helper and a lame horse as a mount to join his brothers-in-law in the hunt. Later, he defends his father's kingdom against a foreign army, and, when he goes home to bathe, his wife takes the turtle shell and burns it.

Analysis
Tale type
Folklorists Stith Thompson and Warren Roberts established an index for South Asian folktales based on the international Aarne-Thompson Index. In their joint work, titled Types of Indic Oral Tales, they identified an Indic type related to the cycle of the Animal as Bridegroom, which they indexed as type 441, ""Hans My Hedgehog"", a miscellaneous type that, while still belonging to the same cycle and dealing with the marriage between a human maiden and an enchanted animal, lacks the quest for the vanished or missing husband.
Stuart Blackburn also related the South Indian tales about ""The Turtle Prince"" to the cycle of the Animal as Bridegroom, but formulated a new Indic type, based on the variants he collected (at least 18 texts): AT 441B Ind, ""The Despised Animal-Husband"". In a 2001 study, he stated that these stories are ""very popular"" South Indian tales.

Motifs
The turtle prince
The tales contain motif T554.5, ""Woman bears tortoise (turtle)"", motif D193, ""Transformation: man to tortoise (turtle)"", B604.2, ""Marriage to tortoise"" and B604.2.1, ""Marriage to turtle"". 
According to scholarship, the Tortoise Prince appears in Tamil folklore. In a version of the tale, he is born after his mother swallows the pit of a mango.

Text
The authorship of the text of the Tutinama is credited to Ziya'al-Din Nakhshabi or just Nakhshabi, a Persian  physician and a Sufi saint who had migrated to Badayun, Uttar Pradesh in India in the 14th century,  who wrote in the Persian language. He had translated and/or edited a classical Sanskrit version of the stories similar to Tutinama into Persian, around 1335 AD. It is conjectured that this small book of short stories, moralistic in theme, influenced Akbar during his formative years. It is also inferred that since Akbar had a harem (of women siblings, wives and women servants), the moralistic stories had specific orientation towards the control of women.

Akbar's first version
The two artists Mir Sayyid Ali and Abd al-Samad were invited by Humayun around 1530–40 to teach this art to himself and to his son Akbar. Initially, the artists came to Kabul with Humayun (where he was in exile) and in later years shifted to Delhi when he won back his empire from the Suri Dynasty. The artists then moved to Fatehpur Sikri with the Mughal Emperor Akbar, where a huge workshop of artists were engaged in producing miniatures.  This type of painting came to be known as Mughal painting, during Akbar's reign from 1556 to 1605 (when under Emperor Akbar's leadership the Mughal empire became most powerful). Akbar provided personal patronage to promote this form of miniature paintings, not only through Iranian artists but also involved a large number of Indian artists who were also well versed in local styles of such miniature paintings that were produced in the imperial workshops. It thus developed as a unique blend of Indian, Persian and Islamic styles.
Most of the paintings are now in the Cleveland Museum of Art; some are also in the British Library. This became the precursor for many more refined forms of Mughal miniature painting portfolios such as the Hamzanama (Adventures of Amir Hamza), Akbarnama (Book of Akbar), Jahangirnama (Tuzk-e-Jahangiri an autobiography of Mughal emperor Jahangir) and so forth, which were created during the reign of subsequent Moghul rulers (16th century to 19th century) as Mughal paintings, but also with distinct Indian, Hindu, Jain and Buddhist influences. The Mughal style covered mainly portraits of Mughal emperors, Queens, court scenes, hunting scenes, special ceremonies, battle scenes, love scenes and various activities of royal rulers. This format of miniatures was also widely adopted by Rajput and Malwa rulers.
In one miniature the figure of the king in the story is the earliest known portrait of Akbar.

Theme of the story
The main narrator of the 52 stories of Tutinama is a parrot, who tells stories to his owner, a woman called Khojasta, in order to prevent her from committing any illicit affair while her husband (a merchant by the name Maimunis) is away on business. The merchant had gone on his business trip leaving behind his wife in the company of a mynah and a parrot. The wife strangles the mynah for advising her not to indulge in any illicit affair. The parrot, realising the gravity of the situation, adopts a more indirect approach of narrating fascinating stories over the next fifty-two nights. The stories are narrated every successive night for 52 nights as an entertaining episode to keep Khojasta's attention and distract her from going out.

One story
A particular tale narrated by the parrot to rivet the attention of his mistress, as she is about to leave the house in the night, is also depicted in the 35th to 37th paintings in the illustrated  version of the Tutinama. The story related by the parrot is of a Brahmin boy falling in love with a princess, considered a fated (doomed) situation. But a solution to this is provided by a magician friend of the Brahmin in the form of magic beads to help his friend to turn into a beautiful woman to seek entry into the palace to be with his loved one. The magician further facilitates the meeting of his friend with the king's daughter by telling the King that the girl in question was his daughter-in-law. On seeking entry into the palace the Brahmin discloses his true identity to his adored princess. But a twist is introduced into the tale with the King's son beholding a beautiful girl (the Brahmin in disguise) while taking bath in a pond falls in love with her. To avoid discovery of his true identity, the Brahmin runs away with the King's daughter. The magician then appears before the King seeking return of his daughter-in-law. But the King realising the true state of the two missing girls, compensates the magician with rich gifts. The gifts are passed on by the magician to his Brahmin friend and his wife to enable them to lead a happy life. The parrot concludes the narration, towards day break, with the advice to Kojasta that she should also have everything in life including her husband.

Style of paintings
It is said that the text of the Tutinama was written in Nasta'liq calligraphy  style. But each of the paintings seen in various libraries across the world focus on a single topic or episode of the stories. The straightforwardness of expressions seen in the paintings is attributed to the influence of pre-Mughal paintings. Several portfolios of Tutinama are also stated to be similar to the Malwa manuscripts with illustrations (dated to 1439 AD) but with distinct perfection. The difference is traced to the tasteful colours in Tutinama paintings, which make it rich in colours with graded quality.
The popular dance form of Kathak, considered a combination of Indian and Persian forms, got a medium for display in the paintings of the Tutinama, the Akbarnama and the Tarrikh-e-Khandan-e-Timuria. In these paintings, men and women are shown wearing long flowing robes and high conical caps in standing positions. Even some paintings depicted two different groups of dancers. It is stated that 350 dancers, who were brought to Akbar's court from Iran by force, probably represented the ancient traditions of dances of Iran. It is inferred that over the years, assimilation of the Persian and the Indian people took place and provided the backdrop for the present Kathak dance style in India.

The tale was published by the Brothers Grimm in the first edition of Kinder- und Hausmärchen, volume 2, in 1815. Their source was Jenny von Droste-Hülshoff. It was originally numbered 47 but appeared as KHM 133 in subsequent editions.

Synopsis
In a kingdom lives a king and his twelve daughters. The twelve princesses sleep in twelve beds in the same bedroom, the doors to which their father locks every night. But every morning, the king unlocks his daughters' bedroom doors to find their shoes worn out as if they have been dancing all night. The king, perplexed, promises that any man who can solve the mystery can marry any of the twelve princesses and inherit the kingdom, but every suitor will be given only three days and three nights to discover the princesses' secret, or he will be beheaded.
Many princes attempt to discover where the twelve princesses dance every night, but all of them fail and are executed. An old soldier, returning from war, meets an old woman to whom he tells of his decision to try the king's challenge. The old woman warns the soldier to avoid drinking the wine the princesses will give him and to pretend to be fast asleep until they leave, and gives him an invisibility cloak that he can use to observe them.
The soldier is well received at the palace and in the evening, the eldest princess comes to his chamber and offers him a cup of wine. The soldier, remembering the old woman's advice, secretly pours the wine into a sponge he has tied under his chin and lies on his bed, snoring loudly as if he were asleep.
The twelve princesses, assured that the soldier is asleep, dress themselves in fine dancing gowns and escape from their room by a trapdoor  beneath the eldest one's bed. The soldier, seeing this, puts on his invisibility cloak and follows them down a flight of stairs. He steps on the gown of the youngest princess, whose cry of alarm to her sisters is rebuffed by the eldest. The passageway leads them to three groves of trees: the first having silver trees, the second golden trees, and the third diamond trees. The invisible soldier breaks off a twig from each grove as evidence, scaring the youngest princess each time he does so. Whenever the youngest princess warns her sisters of the sounds of wood cracking, the eldest dismisses them as salutes. They walk on until they come upon a great clear lake where twelve princes, in twelve boats, are waiting for the twelve princesses. Each princess gets into one boat, the soldier boarding the same one as the youngest princess. The twelfth prince complains to the twelfth princess that their boat is heavier than usual, unaware that the soldier is also on board. On the other side of the lake stands a castle, into which the twelve princesses go and dance the night away.
The twelve princesses happily dance until three in the morning when their shoes are worn out and they must leave. When the twelve princes row the twelve princesses back across the lake, the soldier sits by the eldest. When they reach the top of the secret staircase, the soldier runs ahead of the twelve princesses and lies back in his bed, snoring to trick them into thinking that their secret remains safe.
The soldier does not tell the king of his discovery right away, and follows and spies on the twelve princesses on the second and third nights, with everything happening just as before, except that on the third night, the soldier carries away a cup as a fourth token of where he has been. When the time comes for him to declare the princesses' secret, the soldier presents before the king the three twigs and the cup, and tells the king about all he has seen. The princesses know that there is no use in denying the truth, and confess. The soldier chooses the eldest princess as his bride for he is no longer a young man, and is made the king's heir.
The twelve princes are cursed for as many nights as they have danced with the twelve princesses.

Background
The Brothers Grimm learned the tale from their friends, the Haxthausens, who had heard the tale in Münster. Other versions were known in Hesse and Paderborn. In the Hesse version, only one princess is believed to be responsible for wearing out a dozen shoes every night until a young shoemaker's apprentice discovers that she is joined by eleven other princesses in the revels. The spell is broken, and the apprentice marries the princess. In the Paderborn version, it is three princesses who dance nightly in a palace escorted by three giants. This version introduces the ruse of the soldier disposing of the drugged wine and pretending to be asleep.
Victorian editors disliked the ""do or die"" aspect imposed upon those willing to discover the Princesses' whereabouts, and found ways to avoid it. The candidates who failed simply vanished without explanation instead of being sent to their deaths. Andrew Lang's version has the questing princes vanish and it is revealed they have been enchanted and trapped in the underground world. The hero of Lang's version is a cowherd named Michael, who marries the youngest princess, Lina, not the eldest. Her sisters each marry one of the contestants once they are freed from the enchantment.
The garden of trees with gold, silver, and diamond leaves recalls a similar garden in the Sumerian epic of Gilgamesh.
The Princesses in the Grimms' version are often portrayed as somewhat malicious characters, showing no remorse for lying to their father, and repeatedly giving their suitors drugged wine to ensure that their mystery remains unsolved, despite knowing that those who fail are put to death in some versions of the story.

Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child had an episode called ""The Twelve Dancing Princesses"".
In Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses, Barbie plays the role of the 7th of 12 sisters, Genevieve. This version takes extensive liberties: the princesses are escaping from an evil governess who won't let them dance in the castle (and turns out to be poisoning their father), and the series of men trying to discover their secret is replaced with Derek, a royal cobbler who actively aids them and becomes Genevieve's love interest.
In 1978, a made-for-TV retelling of the story was directed by Ben Rea, featuring Jim Dale as the Soldier, Freddie Jones as the destitute King, and Gloria Grahame as the Witch. Significant changes were made to the story, including reducing the number of princesses to six, and the soldier ultimately declining to marry any of the princesses due to their deceitful nature.
It was retold in literature as  Walter de la Mare's Told Again and Tales Told Again and in Robin McKinley's The Door in the Hedge.
In some versions, such as the one in Robin McKinley's The Door in the Hedge and Ellen Kushner's in Troll's-Eye View, the eldest princess disguises herself as an old woman to give the soldier life-saving advice.
Patricia A. McKillip wrote an adaptation for the anthology A Wolf at the Door.  It has a few variations, the most significant being that the princes who the princesses were spending their nights dancing with were actually dead, and planning to take the princesses away from the mortal world forever the night after the soldier reveals what the princesses were doing.

In this version, the failed suitors are sent to prison instead of executed and the king frees them once Peter solves the mystery. Additionally Peter acquires the magic cloak and some magic shoes from a kappa and another demon who take the form of two men who were arguing over the cloak and shoes; Peter tricks them into competing over the cloak and shoes which allows him to steal them, after which he discovers them to be demons. The cloak makes him invisible and allows him to see through the demon's illusion, while the shoes allow him to levitate and move quickly. After freeing the girls from their trance Peter aids them in fleeing from the demons, though he loses the cloak and shoes in the process; in return, Genevieve and then her sisters help him when the demons almost pull him back inside their world. At the end Peter and Genevieve fall in love and happily marry.

He ruled the region around the end of 10th century. He is popular folk hero of bardic poetry of region.

Tales in bardic literature
Uga Vala was a maternal uncle of Ra Kavat, the Chudasama ruler of Saurashtra. Uga Vala's sister was married to Kavat's father Graharipu. On one occasion when all the warriors were relating their achievements before Kavat, all extolled Uga Vala so much that the Ra grew jealous, and said to Uga Vala that he was a good warrior when aided by Vanthali but otherwise not of much account. Vala Uga, however, boasted that he could manage without the aid of Vanthali, the Chudasama capital, and said metaphorically that he could clap hands with one palm i.e. without the assistance of the Ra. He then left the court in anger and returned to Talaja.
Viramdeva Parmar, the chief who held Shiyal Island, which is one of a group of three islands off the coast of Saurashtra, near Jafrabad. It is said that he was contrived to capture many Rajas by his stratagems and confined them there in a wooden cage. At last, he captured chiefs of all the thirty six races except the Yadava on his island. As he wished to capture Kavat who was Yadava, he persuaded him to visit him on board of his ship which was riding at anchor near Prabhas Patan and there treacherously captured him, and sailing off with him to the Shiyal island confined him there with the other chiefs in the wooden cage.

Kavat, now in prison sent the following message to Uga Vala by means of a wandering minstrel (a bard) who had passed by his prison:Grief at his heart and a wound on his head; Say to Uga Vala, Kavat is in the wooden cage; You said that when occasion arose that you Uga, the Vala lord of Talaja, could clap hands with one palm.
Take your bow in your hand,
So that the crow may not sit on the branch;
If you cannot clap hands with one palm,
Then clap hands, O Uga, with both palms.
The days pass with difficulty,
And an hour seems like a month,
Waiting for you, the Vala,

I have wept out my eyes, O Uga.
On hearing of the capture of Kavat, Uga Vala set off with a large army to release him, and arrived at the Shiyal Island. After obtaining access to the island by a stratagem, he put the garrison to the sword and slew Viramdeva. In his anxiety to release Kavat, he burst open the wooden cage with a kick. In doing this his foot accidentally struck Kavat. Kavat was much enraged at this and though Uga Vala made much submission to him, he treasured up the grudge, and after returning to Vanthali he led an army against Vala Uga and finally killed him near Chitrasar in Babariavad where his paliya (memorial stone) now stands.
Alternate version says that Uga Vala has spared Shiyal Island chief's life. It is said that when he forced his way to the Shiyal Island chief's palace seeking him, that his wife met him and besought him to spare her husband's life in the following stanza:

You have slain seven hundred heroes,
And killed five hundred Pathans;
But if you slay Anant, who alone remains, O Uga,

Then let there be Ebhal Vala's oath on you.
Thus adjured, Uga Vala spared Shiyal Island chief's life, but released all the chiefs whom he had imprisoned.
It is said that Uga Vala's sister came to visit her brother's paliya but found several memorial stones and knew not which was that of her brother In her grief she implored her brother to give her a sign as to which was his paliya and on this Uga Vala's paliya bent forward to greet her. Hence this paliya does not exactly face the east. It is still bending forward as it is supposed to have done to greet his sister.

He is sometimes known as the Lorikayan, after the folkloric tale of that name.

Story
During the 5th century, there was a state called Agori along the Son River (now located in Sonbhadra district). Molagat bhar, the ruling king of the state, despite being a very good king, was jealous of a Yadav man named Mehra because of the power he wielded. One day King Molagat bhar invited Mehra to a gambling match. It was proposed that the winner of the gambling game will rule over the state. Mehra accepted the king's proposal and they began gambling. The king lost everything and had to leave his kingdom. Seeing the plight of the king, Lord Brahma came as a disguised monk and gave him some coins, assuring him that once he plays a game with those coins, his rule would return. The king obeyed, and won. Mehra lost six times and gambled everything away, including his wife, who was pregnant. In the seventh time, he lost his wife's womb as well. But the king seemed to show generosity towards Mehra. He said that if the upcoming baby is a boy then he will work in the stables and if it is girl, she will be appointed in the service of the Queen.
Mehra's seventh child was born as a girl, and named Manjari. When the King discovered this, he sent soldiers to bring Manjari to him. But Manjari's mother refused to part with her  daughter. Instead, she sent a message to the king that he would have to kill Manjari's husband if he wanted to take her with him.
Hence, Manjari's parents were anxious to find a suitor for Manjari who could defeat the king after the wedding. Manjari asked her parents to go to the place of the people named Balia where they will find a youngster named Yadav Veer Lorik. He was her lover in a previous life, and also capable of defeating the king.
Manjari and Lorik's fathers met and the marriage gets fixed. Lorik comes over with half a million people for the wedding, to marry Manjari. 
When they reached the bank of the river son, the king sent his troops to fight Lorik and capture Manjari.
Lorik seemed to be defeated in the war by molagat bhar. Manjari, being an extraordinary girl, goes to Veer Lorik and tells him that there is a village named Gothani near the Agori Fort . She tells him that there is a temple of Lord Shiva in that village and if he goes there and prays to the god, victory will be his.
Lorik does what Manjari said and wins the war so the both married each other. Before leaving the threshold of the village, Manjari tells Lorik to do something great so that the people remember that they loved each other to such an extent.
Veer Lorik asked Manjari that what must he do so that it becomes a symbol of true love and no loving couple would ever return disappointed from here.
Manjari, pointing at a stone, asked Lorik to cut the stone with the same sword he used to kill the King. Lorik did the same, the stone got cut in two pieces. Manjari applied vermilion to her head from a fragmented rock and made the Veer Lorik Stone as Sign of true love, to stand there forever.
SM Pandey called it the national epic of the Ahirs.

Veer Lorik Stone
Veer Lorik Stone, also known in Hindi as Veer Lorik Patthar (from veer 'brave', and patthar 'stone'), is situated around 5 km from Robertsganj on Markundi Hill, in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is a symbol of love and bravery of Lorik and Manjari, the main characters of the local folklore ‘Loriki’. According to the folk tale, Yadav Veer Lorik cut this stone, using his sword, in a single stroke, as proof of his true love. Several folk songs, sung by native folksingers, are based on Loriki. Govardhan Puja, a Hindu festival, is celebrated here every year.
During Govardhan Puja, many couples come here to pray for everlasting love, like that of Veer Lorik and Manjari.

The tale of Prince Vessantara is celebrated as an annual festival in Thailand, Laos, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Cambodia.

Accounts
The story has slight variations in other parts of Asia: in Tibet, the story is known as the Jīnaputra Arthasiddhi Sūtra and the prince known as Arthasiddhi; in China, it is known as Taizi Xudanuo Jing  and the prince is known as Sudana (須大拏太子). He is known as Shudaina-taishi in Japan.
When Gautama Buddha visited his father's kingdom for the first time after he achieved enlightenment, elders of the ruling dynasty did not pay him respect out of conceit, since they were older than the former Prince Siddhartha. The Buddha miraculously appeared in the air above his relatives. His father was the first to bow down and admit that it was time to pay respect to his own son. Other members of the dynasty then bowed down and accepted the religion. Suddenly, rain clouds gathered and a red-drop rain appeared. This miracle led to his followers asking, ""What is this rain?"" He then explained that this rain had appeared once before during his previous life. Then, he told them the story of his life as King Vessantara.

Vessantara's birth and youth
King Vessantara was the son of Sañjaya, king of Sivi, and was born in the capital city of Jatuttara. At this point, Buddhist tradition regards him as a bodhisatta (Sanskrit: bodhisattva), a Buddha-to-be.
His mother, according to tradition, was a princess who did great meritorious deeds and wished to become the mother of the person who would be the next Buddha. After she died, the princess ascended to heaven and became one of the consorts of the deva (Buddhism) called Indra. She lived happily until the day she had to be reborn again as a human. Indra gave her ten boons she could ask for, and one of wishes she made was ""Let me become the mother of bodhisattva, who in his next life will achieve enlightenment"". She descended to the human world, was born in the court of a king, and later married to King Sañjaya.
On the last day of her pregnancy, the Queen wished to sight-see in the capital city. Her husband granted her that wish. She visited several districts, and the people were delighted by their queen. While she was in the merchant quarter, she gave birth in an emergency delivery at the bazaar, in the heart of the city. Therefore, the newborn prince and heir was named Viśvantara (Vessantara), which means 'Born in the merchant quarter'. As soon as he opened his eyes, the infant prince asked his mother for money to give to the poor. On the same day, a female elephant brought her newborn calf to the royal palace. The calf was pure white.
Vessantara grew up to be a kind person who was willing to give away his belongings to others. His parents were delighted by their son's character and supported the prince's charity with their treasures. Vessantara married princess Madri. They had two children: the Prince Jali and the Princess Krishnaajina. Sañjaya retired and Vessantara was crowned King.

Banishment and life as hermit
One day, Vessantara gave away the magical white elephant, which had brought rain to his kingdom, to envoys from Kalinga, a neighboring country which was facing a drought. The citizens of Vessantara's kingdom were distressed by the fear of drought because of the loss of the elephant. Thus, they convinced King Sanjaya to resume control of the kingdom and banish his son Vessantara.
The king readily gave away his kingdom to his father. Before leaving the city and going to live in the forest as a rishi (hermit) with his wife Madri and their two children, Jali and Kanha, he also gave away his wealth.
One of his loyal courtiers suggested that the family should live at Vamka Mountain. They left the city on a four-horse chariot. Along the way Vessantara gave away his horses and four deities appeared in the form of stags to pull the chariot. Then he gave away his chariot. The family walked on foot through a forest. The young prince and princess saw wild fruit hanging on high branches, but their parents could not reach it. Miraculously, all the trees bent their branches for them.
The family then arrived at the neighbouring kingdom of Ceta. The king of Ceta was informed of their arrival and rushed to greet the prince. He was touched by their story and offered his throne, but the prince declined. He and his family also declined to stay in a palace. They started to live celibate lives on a mountain called Vamka. The king of Ceta ordered a hunter to patrol the entrance to the mountain, to prevent anyone from disturbing the family.
Meanwhile, Jujaka, a greedy old brahmin who lived as a beggar, had a very young wife, Amittada, who was also very beautiful and hard-working. During the drought, Amittada regularly brought water from the well for her old husband. The husbands of the other women in the village held her up as an example of a good industrious wife. One day, in a fit of jealousy, all the village women gathered by the well and beat up the Brahmin's young wife, tearing her clothes.

From that day onwards Amittada refused to go to the well any longer. She pushed Jujaka telling him to find her some servants in order to spare her more ridicule. She did not give her husband any peace.
Jujaka met a forester guarding the entrance to the Vamka Mountain and tricked him by claiming that Vessantara's banishment had been revoked. He met a hermit and tricked him as well. Finally, the brahmin Jujaka went to the forest to prince Vessantara while his wife Madri was away. He asked him for his two children, which Vessantara readily gave away. Jali and Kanha went to hide in a lotus pond. Their father found them and asked if they would help their father achieve his highest goal, the attainment of Buddhahood a future life. Both agreed and became Jujaka's servants. Vessantara told the brahmin to bring the children to their grandfather, saying, ""The king will reward you for bringing his beloved grandchildren back to him"". Jujaka disagreed, stating the Sunjaya would execute him instead. The brahmin tied both children with vines and dragged them like cattle. Both children begged their father to help them while the old man scolded and beat them with his stick. Vessantara could not stand this scene and reached for his weapon he kept in his hut. However, he overcame all anger and let his children be taken away.
Madri's return passage to their residence was blocked by tigers (actually deities in disguise). When she didn't see her children, she wandered around all night looking for them and finally collapsed before her husband. Vessantara thought she was dead so he lamented his loss. He put her head on his lap and realised that she was still breathing. He revived Madri with water. She woke up and rose immediately to keep a distance appropriate for her vow of celibacy. Vessantara told her what had happened. After Madri learnt that her husband gave away their children, she praised him for his greatness.
Fearing that Vessantara would give away his wife as well, the deity Śakra intervened and in disguise, asked for his wife Madri, who Vessantara readily gave him. Then Indra gave Madri back to Vessantara as a trust, for all his acts of benevolence and generosity had been perfect.

Return to Sivi
Two deities felt sympathy for the young prince and princess. They disguised themselves as their parents and helped nurse Jali and Kanha. They made Jujaka take a wrong turn and led him to into Sivi Kingdom and through the palace gate. King Sanjaya saw the two familiar faces and ordered royal guards to bring them to him. He recognized his grandchildren and paid for their price. Kanha's price was higher than her brother's, as her father wanted no-one to buy her from Jujaka. In fact, both Jali and Kanha's prices were so high that only king Sanjaya could have bought them.
Jujaka became extremely rich. At his first meal as a rich man, he ate too much. His digestive system failed and he fell dead upon his plate. King Sanjaya sent his men to find Jujaka's family to seize the latter's wealth; however, his wife and in-laws were afraid of the punishment for Jujaka's treason, so they fled.
Sanjaya arranged a grand procession to meet his son and daughter-in-law. The Kingdom of Kalinga also returned the white elephant, now that Kalinga had become prosperous again. This abated the anger of the people of Sivi. Jali led the army and civilians to his parents' residence and the family was reunited. After the most happy moment, all six of them collapsed.
The red rain poured down from Heaven to revive the family. This rain ""soaks those who want to be soaked, but will not fall on those who want to stay dry."" Vessantara was crowned as king again and returned to his kingdom. Indra blessed the Sivi Kingdom with a rain of gems. Vessantara allowed people to keep those gems for themselves and the leftovers went into the Kingdom treasury, which he used for his charity. His treasure never ran out.
Buddha explained that each person had been reborn in the time of the Buddha as people surrounding the Buddha's person. His parents used to be Vessantara's parents. Madri was now reborn as the Buddha's former wife. Jali became Rahula, the Buddha's son. Kanha became Upalavanna, the bhikkhuni (nun). The loyal courtier who informed him of the place he should stay became Ananda, his now cousin and attendant. Jujaka became Devadatta, his now arch enemy. The white elephant became Maha Kassapa.

Culture and art
The Vessantara Jataka is celebrated in temples during a Buddhist festival known as Thet Mahachat (Thai: เทศน์มหาชาติ), from Maha Jati or ""Great Birth"", in Central Thailand, Boun Pha Vet in Laos and as Bun Phawet (Bun Phra Wes), Bun Duan Sii ('Merit-making of the fourth month') or Thet Phawet in Isan. It is also an important celebration in Cambodia, Burma and Sri Lanka.
In Sri Lanka, verses of lament from the text Vessantara Kāvya are often recited at the corpse of a relative who just died, especially the verses of Madri mourning the loss of her children. This text was composed in Sri Lanka in the early modern period by a secular poet, and emphasizes abandonment and emotional desolation. The themes were very popular among the ordinary people, though the emphasis was very different than the earlier Buddhist texts.
The Thet Mahachat is very popular both in rural and urban communities, often with dance and drama performances, as well as festive parades and processions through the towns. During this Buddhist festival the monks give a sermon about the entire text of the Vessantara Jataka, accompanied by rituals and cultural performances. Because of its central role in the Thet Mahachat or Boun Pha Vet celebrations, the Vessantara Jataka is an important part of the traditional folklore in many areas of the Southeast Asian region. Some of the scenes, especially the mismatched couple formed by Jujaka, the old Brahmin, and his young wife Amittada, are attractive for the public during the festival. While it has lost its traditional importance in some areas, in others it has gained in popularity.
Scenes of the Vessantara Jataka are found depicted on the walls of Buddhist temples throughout Southeast Asia. They are also engraved on the murals of Angkor Wat, Cambodia, and depicted in ancient patterns on ikat silk cloth.

Role in legitimizing kingship
In the last seven centuries in Thailand, the Vessantara Jātaka has played a significant role in legitimating kingship in Thailand, through the Great Birth festival. Merit-making and paramis were greatly emphasized in this festival, through the story about Prince Vessantara's generosity. Initially, the festival was an important way for the Chakri dynasty to legitimate itself, as Vessantara was the model prince who became king through the power of his merits and sacrifice. During the reform period of Rama IV, however, as Thai Buddhism was being modernized, the festival was dismissed as not reflecting true Buddhism. Its popularity has greatly diminished ever since. Nevertheless, the use of merit-making by the Thai monarchy and government to solidify their position and create unity in society has continued until at least the late twentieth century.

Depiction of brahmins
Jūjaka plays an important role in the Vessantara story. Depicted as lustful, cruel and a coward, his very name implies decrepitude. These kind of depictions of brahmins are typical for Buddhist popular literature.

Plot
The legendary king Vikramāditya (Vikrama) promises a vamachari (a tantric sorcerer) that he will capture a vetala, who hangs upside-down from a tree and inhabits and animates dead bodies.
King Vikrama faces many difficulties in bringing the vetala to the tantric. Each time Vikram tries to capture the vetala, it tells a story that ends with a riddle. If Vikrama cannot answer the question correctly, the vampire consents to remain in captivity. If the king knows the answer but still keeps quiet, then his head shall burst into thousand pieces. And if King Vikrama answers the question correctly, the vampire would escape and return to his tree. He knows the answer to every question; therefore the cycle of catching and releasing the vampire continues twenty-four times.

On the twenty-fifth attempt, the Vetala tells the story of a father and a son in the aftermath of a devastating war. They find the queen and the princess alive in the chaos, and decide to take them home. In due time, the son marries the queen and the father marries the princess. Eventually, the son and the queen have a son, and the father and the princess have a daughter. The vetala asks what the relation between the two newborn children is. The question stumps Vikrama. Satisfied, the vetala allows himself to be taken to the tantric.

On their way to the tantric, Vetala tells his story. His parents did not have a son and a tantric blessed them with twin sons on a condition that both be educated under him. Vetala was taught everything in the world but often ill-treated. Whereas his brother was taught just what was needed but always well treated. Vetala discovered that the tantric planned to return his brother to his parents and Vetala instead would be sacrificed as he was an  'all-knowing kumara'  and by sacrificing him the tantric could be immortal and rule the world using his tantric powers. Vetal also reveals that now the tantric's plan is to sacrifice Vikram, beheading him as he bowed in front of the goddess. The tantric could then gain control over the vetala and sacrifice his soul, thus achieving his evil ambition. The vetala suggests that the king asks the tantric how to perform his obeisance, then take advantage of that moment to behead the sorcerer himself. Vikramāditya does exactly as told by the vetala and he is blessed by Indra and Kali. The vetala offers the king a boon, whereupon Vikram requests that the tantric's heart and mind be cleaned of all sins and his life be restored as a good living being and that the vetala would come to the king's aid when needed.

Variation
A variation of this story replaces the vetal with a minor celestial who, in exchange for his own life, reveals the plot by two tradesmen (replacing the sorcerer) to assassinate Vikrama and advises Vikrama to trick them into positions of vulnerability as described above. Having killed them, Vikrama is offered a reward by the goddess, who grants him two spirits loyal to her as his servants.

Other media
Films
It was adapted into 1951 Hindi film Jai Maha Kali (Vikram Vaital) by Dhirubhai Desai starring Lalita Pawar, Nirupa Roy, Shahu Modak, Raj Kumar, and S. N. Tripathi. It was remade in 1986 as Vikram Vetal, by Shantilal Soni, starring Vikram Gokhale, Manhar Desai, and Deepika Chikhalia.
The 2017 Tamil film Vikram Vedha was a modern-day adaptation of the story with the characterization of King Vikramaditya and the celestial spirit Vetala derived from that plot. The title of the film was also derived from the two key characters from the folktale. In 2022, the film was remade in Hindi under the same title.

Television
In 1985, the story was developed by Sagar Films as a television serial titled Vikram aur Betaal, starring Arun Govil as Vikrama and Sajjan Kumar as the Vetala. It was aired on Doordarshan, the public television broadcaster of India. A remake of that serial by the new generation of Sagar Films, titled Kahaniyaan Vikram aur Betaal Ki, was aired on the Indian satellite channel Colors.
Indian animator Rajiv Chilaka directed Vikram Betal, a television film for Cartoon Network in 2004 which was produced by his Green Gold Animations. Another 2006 supernatural sitcom Vicky & Vetaal was inspired by the Baital Pachisi. A web series titled The Vetala was released in 2009, written and directed by Damon Vignale. The series reveals a CGI vetala character in the final episode.
2018 Hindi TV adaptation Vikram Betaal Ki Rahasya Gatha was aired on &TV, where actors Aham Sharma and Makrand Deshpande as playing the role of King Vikramaditya and Betaal respectively.

Literature
The children's Chandamama, featured a serial story titled New Tales of Vikram and Betal for many years. As the title suggests, the original premise of the story is maintained, as new stories are told by Vetala to King Vikrama.
In the novel, Alif the Unseen, a character named Vikrama the Vampire appears as a jinn. He tells how thousands of years ago, King Vikrama had set off to defeat the Vetala, a vampire jinn terrorizing one of his villages. Vikrama won the Vetala's game of wits, but forfeited his life. The Vetala now inhabits his body.

Recensions, editions, and translations
Sanskrit
Both the Kṣemendra and Somadeva recensions derive from the unattested ""Northwestern"" Bṛhatkathā, and include the Vetala Tales as a small part of their huge inventory. The recensions of Śivadāsa and Jambhaladatta contain only the Vetala Tales and have an unknown relationship to each other and to the other Sanskrit recensions.

Hindi
Some time between 1719 and 1749, Ṣūrat Kabīshwar translated Śivadāsa's Sanskrit recension into Braj Bhasha; this work was subsequently translated in 1805 under the direction of John Gilchrist into the closely related Hindustani language by Lallu Lal and others. This was a popular work that played an early role in the development of Literary Hindi and was selected as a Hindustani test-book for military service students in the East India Company. Thus it became the basis of several Hindi editions, and Indian vernacular and English translations; many of these frequently reprinted.

Sanskrit and Hindi frames
Transfers of throne and fruit
King Gandharvasena (father of Vikramaditya) dies. His 1st son, Shank, succeeds, but is killed by the 2nd son, Vikramaditya, who succeeds to the throne. However, Vikramaditya goes abroad, consigning the throne to the 3rd son, Bharthari. Then follows the episode of the Fruit of Immortality: the fruit gets passed around, its trail revealing conflicting loyalties; because of this, Bharthari becomes despondent and vacates the throne. Indra sends a demon to guard the city, but Vikramaditya returns to regain the throne and subdues the demon. The demon narrates the story of ""Three sons"" (below) to Vikramaditya.
This narrative does not occur in any of the Sanskrit recensions. It begins Lāl's Hindi translation, and has a close analogue in the Thirty-Two Tales of the Throne of Vikramaditya (Simhāsana Dvātriṃśikā). Burton includes it in his introduction.

Three sons
A) A king comes across an ascetic absorbed in supernatural meditation. Out of pique the king decides to disturb the ascetic, and sends a harlot to seduce him. She succeeds and eventually brings the ascetic and his son to the city, at which point the ascetic realizes he has been tricked out of his merit. In anger he kills his child.
B) This leads (it is not explained how) to the birth of 3 children in the same city at the same time with linked destinies: the sons of a king, a potter, and an oil merchant. The potter's son kills the oil merchant's son.
This narrative occurs in Sivadasa and Lāl. Only in Lāl is it made clear that the king's son is Vikramaditya, the potter's son is the yogi (of the subsequent section), and the oil merchant's son is the body inhabited by the Vetala. In his conclusion, Jambhaladatta has the Vetala narrate his own previous history which is somewhat related to part B, but with a very different overall story. Burton has Indra's giant tell part B, then part A which occurs subsequently (the ascetic here being the yogi himself).

Yogi and Vetala
Every day, a yogi (Kṣāntiśīla in many versions) brings a fruit to Vikramaditya which he passes off to an attendant or minister. One day the fruit is accidentally broken open in the king's presence, revealing a priceless jewel. Investigation reveals that all the fruits likewise contained jewels. Vikramaditya questions the yogi who states that he intends to perform rites in a cremation-ground and asks the king to join him on a certain night. Vikramaditya agrees. When he does so, the yogi asks him to bring him a certain dead body hanging from a tree in another nearby cremation-ground. The body turns out to be inhabited by a vetala, who decides to pass the time on the way back to the yogi by telling tales.
This narrative occurs in all 4 Sanskrit recensions, as well as most other versions.

Conclusion
After the Vetala is done telling his tales, he helps Vikramaditya by predicting the yogi's treachery, and explaining a ruse by which he can avoid it. Vikramaditya finally succeeds in bringing the body to the yogi, and just before the end of the rite, tricks and kills the yogi. Vikramaditya then generally receives great power and specific boons (including that this very story achieve great renown).
This narrative occurs in all 4 Sanskrit recensions, as well as most other versions. The power and boons are attributed to different sources in different versions, e.g. a result of the rite itself (Sivadasa), gandharvas (Sivadasa), Indra (Lāl), Shiva (Somadeva), a goddess (Jambhaladatta).
An abbreviated version of ""Yogi and Vetala"" and the Conclusion is given as the 31st of the Thirty-Two Tales of the Throne of Vikramaditya (Simhāsana Dvātriṃśikā).

Other frames
The beginning of the Tamil version mirrors the frame story of the Katha-sarit-sagara, in that the Vetala is actually a Brahmin, cursed for repeating Shiva's tale — the Vetala Tales in fact — which the Vetala must now repeat until someone (Vikrama) can solve their riddles.
The compilation, also known as Tales of the Bewitched Corpse, migrated northwards to Tibet (where it appears as Ro-sgrung) and later to Mongolia (where it is known as Siditü kegür, and in Oirat as Siddhi kǖr). In both the Tibetan and Mongolian versions not only the frame story, but also the component tales, are quite different.

Monument
In memory of Waghya, a memorial was built next to Shivaji Maharaj's samadhi at Raigad Fort with a donation by Indore’s Prince Tukoji Holkar in 1906, who gave ₹5,000 (equivalent to ₹1.7 million or US$19,000 in 2023) towards the dog's statue.
Reportedly by Mid-Day, the statue of Waghya was erected on a Samadhi at Shivaji's memorial in 1936 under the banner of Shri Shivaji Raigad Smarak Samati (SSRSS) in leadership of Narasimha Chintaman Kelkar.

Attack on Waghya's Statue on Raigarh Fort
In 2011, Sambhaji Brigade, an extremist group was responsible for a protest and attack against Waghya's statue located on Raigad Fort next to Shivaji Maharaj's memorial. The group claimed that the dog was not real and there shouldn't be a memorial for it. This act was strongly opposed by local Dhangar community for they believe that the dog was real.

In popular culture
Waghya's heroic story was portrayed in Rajsanyas, a play by Ram Ganesh Gadkari, a noted Marathi playwright.

Synopsis
A king was dying. An old man told his sons that the water of life would save him. Each one set out in turn. The two older ones, setting out in hopes of being the heir, were rude to a dwarf on the way and became trapped in ravines. When the youngest son went, the dwarf asked where he was going, and he told him. The dwarf told him it was in a castle, and gave him an iron wand to open the gates and two loaves to feed to the lions inside.  Then he had to get the water before the clock struck 12 when the gates would shut again.
He opened the gate with the wand and fed the lions the bread. Then he came to a hall where there were sleeping princes, and he took rings from their fingers and some bread and a sword from the table. He went on and found a beautiful princess, who kissed him, told him he had freed her, and promised to marry him if he returned within a year. Then she told him where the spring was. He went on, but saw a bed and lay down to sleep. When he woke, it was a quarter to twelve. He sprang up, got the water, and escaped, with the closing gate taking off the heel of his boot.
He met the dwarf who told him what happened to his brothers and at his imploring freed them, warning that they had evil hearts. They came to a kingdom plagued by war and famine, the prince killed their foes with the sword and fed them with the loaf. Then they came to two more kingdoms in the same situation, and they did the same. Then they got on a ship to cross the sea and come home. The older brothers stole the water of life and filled his bottle with sea water.
The king was sickened by the sea water. The older brothers accused the youngest of trying to poison him and gave him the water of life. The king decided to have his youngest son secretly killed (as punishment). He sent a huntsman with him into the woods, but the huntsman was unable to bring himself to kill him and confessed the deed to the prince. The prince and the huntsman swapped clothes and the prince fled.
Treasure arrived, from the three kingdoms the youngest prince had saved, and the king wondered about his guilt and regretted having his son killed. The huntsman confessed that he had not killed him, and so the king issued a proclamation that he could freely return.
The princess in the castle had made a golden road to it and told her people that it would bring her true groom to her and to admit no one who did not ride straight up it. The two older princes (who were pretending to be the ones who freed her) saw it and thought it would be a shame to get it dirty, so they rode alongside, and the servants did not admit them. The youngest thought so constantly of the princess that he did not notice it, so he rode up it, was admitted, and they married. The prince went back to his father and told the true story. The king wished to punish the older brothers, but they had already boarded a ship and were never seen again.

Analysis
Tale type
The tale is classified in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as type ATU 551, ""The Water of Life"" or ""Sons on a Quest for a Wonderful Remedy for Their Father"". Folklorist Stith Thompson noted the great similarities between this tale type and type ATU 550, ""Quest for the Golden Bird"" or ""Bird, Horse and Princess"".

Variants
Literary history
German scholar Ernst Tegethoff translated a medieval French romance he titled Die Quelle der Jugend (""The Fountain of Youth""): a king is sick, and the doctors claim only the water from the fountain of life can cure him. He sends his three sons to find and bring him the water, but they have first to pass through four obstacles, the last of which a castle where a maiden resides and holds the very keys to the fountain. The youngest prince is advised by an old hermit on how to defeat the perils and reach the castle. Once there, he begs the maiden for the water, which she obliges and declares to be his wife.

Europe
Swedish folktale collectors George Stephens and Gunnar Olof Hyltén-Cavallius listed ""The Water of Life"" as a German variant close to the Swedish tale they collected,  Ungdoms-Landet (English: 'The Land of Youth'). They also mentioned a Russian variant titled Das Märchen von Ljubin Czarewitsch, der schönen Czarewna, seiner Gemahlinn, und dem beflügelten Wolf, which was translated years later as Story of Lyubim Tsarevich and the Winged Wolf and Prince Lubim and the Winged Wolf.
In several variants, the object that can cure the king is either the water of youth, the waters of life and death, or a magical bird. In others, the king can be healed by seeking both items, such as in the Hungarian variant Der Fink mit der goldenen Stimme ('The finch with the golden voice'). At the end of the tale, the fairy maiden or foreign princess travels with her army or navy to the prince's kingdom in order to find the man who stole her wonderful bird or magical water.
In Estonian sources, the tale type is known as Imelik peegel ('The Wonderful Mirror') or Noorendav peegel ('The Mirror That Makes One Younger'), after a homonymous story by author Juhan Kunder.
At least two Armenian variants combine the tale type ATU 551, ""The Water of Life (The Wonderful Remedy for the King)"" with ATU 531, ""The Clever Horse"". In Kush-Pari or The Bird-Peri, three princes search for a cure for their father's blindness, but only the youngest is successful in journeying beyond the realm with his father's magical horse. The prince finds a brilliant golden feather on the way to another kingdom and delivers it to a second king, who wants the bird: the titular Kush-Pari. The prince fetches the Kush-Pari, her handmaiden and forty fiery mares for a ritual. The prince and the king take part in the ritual, but the king dies and the prince marries the Kush-Pari, now in human form. As the tale concludes, the Kush-Pari gives her husband the remedy to save his father. In The Fiery Horse, the three princes must seek, as remedy for their father, a lump of earth from ""no human has even trodden"". To help them in their quest, they need their father's Fiery Horse, found in the depths of a forest, but only the youngest prince finds and rides it. They ride into the Dark City and find a Luminous Feather. They appear before the king of this city, who wishes to own the bird of the luminous plumage. The second task is to bring the king the maiden who owns 40 cows swift as the wind and their milk as the third task. The prince and the king go through a ritual with the boiling milk, but only the prince goes unscathed and marries the maiden. Some time later, she reveals her husband the location of the fabled lump of earth: at the bottom of a lake, guarded by ""ferocious Watery Horses tall as Mares"".

Asia
India
In an Indian variant, The Rose of Bakawali (Hindi-Urdu: Gul-e-Bakawali), the king becomes blind and, on his doctors's orders, sends his five sons for the only possible cure: the magical rose (gulbakavali) of the fairy princess Bakawali. W. A. Clouston saw the quest for the magical flower as a parallel to the German fairy tale ""The Water of Life"".

In popular culture
The Water of Life was featured in Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics as part of its ""Grimm Masterpiece Theater"" season. One of the brothers is eliminated from the story, and the two remaining princes are named Joseph (the protagonist) and Franz (his treacherous eldest brother). Joseph's love interest is named Princess Anna. Additionally, the dwarf summons animals and the North Wind to ask them if they know where the Water can be found. The North Wind reveals its location to Joseph while the dwarf had previously banished Franz to the Valley of No Return due to his rudeness. The wand is replaced by the magic of the moonlight which Joseph uses to break the lock of the room containing Princess Anne, who is under attack by a demon who is destroyed by the moonlight. While Joseph collects the water, Anne flees the evil castle though picks up Joseph's broken sword which reveals to her the name of Joseph's kingdom. Joseph promises to court her once his father is well. While returning home, Joseph finds his injured brother Franz and heals him with the water. Despite being saved and healed by his brother, Franz conspires to switch the water with water from a nearby swamp as opposed to seawater. Instead of ordering Joseph's execution at first the king banishes him from the castle after being tricked by Franz, though he later orders the huntsman to kill Joseph after Franz convinces the King that Joseph will try to poison him again. Additionally, Joseph accepts his fate and asks his friend the huntsman who is also a knight to kill him as it is his duty as a knight to follow the king's orders. The huntsman instead convinces Joseph to flee the kingdom after refusing to kill him knowing that Joseph is innocent. He then delivers Joseph's clothes as 'evidence' that the deed is done, and then quits the king's service, stating that he can no longer serve the king after what he has done. Finally, it is Princess Anne who reveals Franz' treachery to his father when she appears at Franz' coronation to offer her hand in marriage believing it to be Joseph's coronation. Franz is apprehended by the palace guards when he attempts to flee as the heartbroken King explains to Anne that he had ordered Joseph's death, causing her to faint from a broken heart. While on the way home, Anna asks for some water as she continues to mourn the loss of Joseph and her carriage happens to stop at a nearby windmill where Joseph and the huntsman happen to be working. She recognizes Joseph by his voice and the two are happily reunited. The fate of Franz is never revealed and it is unclear if the King learns of his youngest son's survival.
A quote from the story was used as the opening quote for an episode of the NBC series Grimm.
Elements of the fairy tale were used in the John Connolly’s The Book of Lost Things.
The Indian variant of the folktale Gul-e-Bakavali (The Rose of Bakawali) has been adapted into numerous films in India. These include: Gul-e-Bakavali (1924) by Kanjibhai Rathod, Chatra Bakavali (1926) by Shree Nath Patankar, Bakavali (1930) by Mohanlal D. Shah, Gul-e-Bakavali (1932) by Anand Prasad Kapoor, Chatra Bakavali (1932) by J. J. Madan, Gul Bakaoli (1938) by Barkat Mehra, Gul-E-Bakawali (1939) by D. M. Pancholi, Gul-e-Bakavali (1947) by Rustom Modi, Gul-E-Bakavali (1955) by T. R. Ramanna, Gulebakavali Katha (1962) by N. T. Rama Rao, Gul-e-Bakavali (1963) by Jugal Kishore. Chandramukhi, an Indian television series which aired on DD National in 2007, was also loosely based on the folktale of Gul-e-Bakavali.

Alternate names
The story is alternatively named Rose and Cypress, Gul o Sanaubar, Qissa Gul-o-Sanaubar or What the Rose did to the Pine. Author Garcin de Tassy translated it to French language as Rose & Cyprès, and Felix Liebrecht to German, under the name Rose und Cypresse.

Origins and interpretation
Professor Mahomed-Nuri Osmanovich Osmanov translated the word ""Gul"" as 'rose, flower', and ""Sanaubar"" as 'cypress'.
The tale is described as having ""Hindustani"" origin, and scholar Christine Goldberg, in her book Turandot's Sisters, indicated that it belongs to a literary tradition that migrated to Europe in the Middle Ages. The story is also said to be famous in Iran.

Synopsis
A king had three sons. The oldest went hunting and chased a deer, giving orders that it should be captured rather than killed. It led him to a sandy waste where his horse died.  He found a tree with a spring beneath it and drank. A faqir asked him what he did there. He told him his story and asked the faqir's,  repeating when the faqir put him off, until the faqir told him he had been a king, and his seven sons had all tried to win a princess whose hand could only be won by answering the riddle, ""What did the rose do to the cypress?"" and died for their failure.  His grief sent him into the desert.
This inspired the son with a love for the same princess. His attendants found him and brought him back, but he grew ill for love, and his confidants found this out and revealed it to the king. The king made arrangements for him to go.  At the city, the princess's father tried to dissuade him. He was asked, failed, and was executed. His second brother followed and likewise died.
Finally the third went, but having reached the city, he saw his brothers' heads and went to a nearby village, where he took shelter with an ancient, childless couple. Disguising himself, he searched the city for the secret, and found he could get into the princess's garden by a stream. There he hid, but when the princess sent her maids for water, they saw his reflection and were terrified. The princess had her nurse bring him to her. He answered her questions at random, convincing her that he was mad, but his beauty made her protect him as her own. Dil-aram, who had seen him first, grew fond of him and begged him to tell her what he was about; finally, he was convinced she was in love with him, told her his story, and promised to marry her and keep her among his favorites. She could not answer the riddle, but knew that a certain African from Waq of the Caucasus had told the princess it.
The prince set out to Waq of the Caucasus. An old man advised him on how to arrive there, despite the jinns, demons, and peris. He should take this road until it split, then take the middle road for a day and a night, where he would find a pillar. He should do what was written on the pillar. He found a warning where the roads split, against the middle road, but took it and came to a garden. He had to pass a giant man to reach it, and a woman there tried to persuade him from his way. When she failed, she enchanted him into a deer.
As a deer, he came to lead a band of deer. He tried to jump from the enchanted garden but found that it would bring him back where he had jumped from. The ninth time, however, the other deer vanished. A beautiful woman there took him as a pet. He wept, and the woman realized he had been enchanted by her sister. She turned him back, gave him a bow and arrows, a sword, and a dagger, that had all belonged to heroes, and told him that he must seek out the home of the Simurgh, but she could not direct him to it.
He obeyed her directions about the Place of Gifts, where wild animals lived, and a lion-king gave him some hairs, saying he must burn them for aid. He disobeyed her directions to avoid the castle of clashing swords, because whatever was fated to happen to him would happen, and fought the people there. With the lion's aid, he defeated them, rescuing a princess, and gave it all into the lion's care until he was done with his quest.
He found the Simurgh's nest, where only the young ones were, and killed a dragon there; then he fed the hungry young birds on it, and they slept, being full. When their parents returned, the lack of noise convinced them that the prince had killed and eaten their young, but the mother bird insisted on checking to discover the truth, and the young ones woke. The Simurgh carried him to Waq, and gave him three feathers, any of which would summon him.
At Waq, he learned that only the king knew the riddle and went to court.  He gave the king a diamond and said it was his last treasure. The king wished to please him, but the prince wanted only the answer to the riddle. When he asked, the king said he would have killed anyone else, but when the king went on asking what the prince wanted, the prince refused to ask for anything.  Finally, the king told him that he could have what he wanted, if he consented to die afterward. He was the cypress, and his wife, whom he had brought before them in chains and rags, was the rose. He had once rescued peris and restored their sight, and in return, they had arranged for his marriage to a peri princess. She had betrayed him, riding off every night to a man who beat her. The king had killed him and his fellows, except the one who escaped to tell the princess with the riddle.  He then told the prince to prepare for execution.  The prince asked only for a final washing, but when washing, he summoned the Simurgh, and it carried him off.
He returned.  On the way, he married the princess from the castle of clashing swords, and the woman who had disenchanted him.  At the city, he demanded the African whom the princess hid beneath her throne to confirm the truth of his words.  He told the story, and the king having found the African, he confirmed it.  Instead of marrying the princess, he took her captive, had the head decently buried, and sent for Dil-aram.
At home, the prince had the African torn apart between four horses.  The princess begged for mercy; those who had died had been fated to die, and it was her fate to be his.  He forgave her, married her and Dil-aram, and lived happily with his four wives.

Variants
Orientalist Garcin de Tassy himself noted, in an 1868 publication, that he knew at least six translations of the story: one from a man named ""Nem Chand"" or ""Prem Chand"", which he translated in 1860, in Revue orientale et américaine; another supposedly translated from Persian; at least two versions penned by escrivener Ahmad Ali.
Variants also exist in Armenia, Turkestan and one was collected by Haxthausen.
Scholars Ulrich Marzolph and Richard van Leewen point that the Persian tale is parallel to the story The Splendid Tale of Prince Diamond, and The Tender Tale of Prince Yasamîn and Princess Almond, both present in The Arabian Nights.
Linguist Adolf Dirr published a Caucasian variant titled Von Balai und von Boti.
In a Georgian variant, Gulambara and Sulambara, after a prince is banished by his father and meets a mysterious yet helpful boy in his wanderings, both reach a city. One day, the prince goes out and sees a tower with a row of spiked heads nearby. The prince asks the meaning of a gruesome sight: the princess asks any potential suitor a riddle, ""Who are Gulambara and Sulambara?"". The prince knows Gulambara and Sulambara are names of flowers, but he is given a chance to answer correctly.

Analysis
The tale of a princess who challenges her suitors with deadly riddles is similar to the story of Turandot. As such, it belongs in a series of folktales involving riddles.
The heroic prince helping the mythical creature and it repaying the favour is a motif that echoes the Roman fable of Androcles and the Lion.
Angelo de Gubernatis analysed the motif of the rose and the cypress of the story, postulating that the cypress is a phallic symbol or representative of the male prince, and the rose the symbol of the female beloved.

Adaptations
A number of films have been made in India based on the fable. These include: Gul Sanobar (1928) silent film by Homi Master, Gul Sanobar (1934) remade in sound by Homi Master, Gul Sanobar (1953) by Aspi Irani.
Gul Sanobar, an Indian television series based on the legend was aired by the national public broadcaster Doordarshan on DD National in the early 2000s.

Yakshas appear in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist texts. Several monumental yakshas are known from the time of the Maurya Empire period. They are variously dated from around the 3rd century BCE to the 1st century BCE. These statues are monumental (usually around 2 metres tall), and often bear inscriptions related to their identification as yakshas. They are considered as the first known monumental stone sculptures in India. Two of these monumental yakshas are known from Patna, one from Vidisha and one from Parkham, as well as one yakshini from Vidisha. The yakṣas may have originally been the tutelary deity of a city, district, lake, or well. Their worship, together with popular belief in nagas (serpent deities), feminine fertility deities, and mother goddesses, may have had its origin among the early Hindu people of India. Yaksha worship coexisted with the priest-conducted sacrifices of the Vedic period. They were later viewed as the steward deities of the earth and the wealth buried beneath.

Kubera
In Hindu, Buddhist and Jain Religion, Kubera, wealth and prosperity, is considered the king of the yakshas and protector of the world (Lokapāla). In Buddhism, he is equated with Vaiśravaṇa.

His many epithets extol him as the overlord of numerous semi-divine species and the owner of the treasures of the world. Kubera is often depicted with a plump body, adorned with jewels, carrying a money-pot and a club. His vahana (vehicle) is the mongoose. He is often seen with Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth, fortune and prosperity.

In Buddhism
In Buddhist literature, the yakṣa are the attendants of Vaiśravaṇa, the guardian of the northern quarter, a beneficent god who protects the righteous. The term also refers to the Twelve Heavenly Generals who guard Bhaiṣajyaguru, the Medicine Buddha. The yakshas of many Buddhist stories are ugly ogres, reborn in that form because of sins committed during their past lives as humans.
One such malevolent yaksha, Silesaloma, appears in the Jataka tales of the Pali Buddhist canon. In the story ""Prince Five-Weapons and the Sticky-Haired Demon"", Silesaloma is described as being the height of a palm tree, with sharp teeth and two yellow tusks, and a coat of thick, matted fur. A bodhisattva named Prince Panchayudha (Five-Weapons) attempted to kill Silesaloma, but all his attacks, from both his weapons and his bare hands, were thwarted by Silesaloma's sticky hair. Ultimately, Prince Panchayudha impressed Silesaloma with his bravery, and the yaksha decided to let him go. Panchayudha explained that Silesaloma's monstrous state was caused by wicked deeds from his past lives, and he taught the yaksha the five precepts, after which Silesaloma renounced violence and transformed into a friendly forest spirit.
The Mahāmāyūrīvidyārājñī Sūtra, a text that dates back to fourth century or earlier (translated from the Sanskrit by Kumarajiva), gives a large list of yakshas that reside in the classical cities of ancient India who are invoked to seek the protection of the BuddhaDharma:

In Jainism
Jains mainly maintain cult images of Arihants and Tirthankaras, who have conquered the inner passions and attained moksha. Yakshas and yakshinis are found in pair around the cult images of Jinas, serving as guardian deities. The yaksha is generally on the right-hand side of the Jina image while the yakshini is on the left-hand side. They are regarded mainly as devotees of the Jina and have supernatural powers. They are also wandering through the cycles of births and deaths just like the worldly souls, but have supernatural powers.

The Harivamsapurana (783 CE) refers to them as Shasandevatas. Initially among the yakshas, Manibhadra and Purnabadra yakshas and Bahuputrika yakshini were popular. The yaksha Manibhadra is worshipped by the Jains affiliated with the Tapa Gachchha. During tenth and thirteenth centuries yaksha Saarvanubhuti, or Sarvahna and yakshinis Chakreshvari, Ambika, Padmavati, and Jwalamalini became so popular that independent temples devoted to them were erected.
Yakshas and yakshinis are common among the Murtipujaka Śvētāmbara and Bispanthi Digambara Jains. The Digambara Terapanth movement opposes their worship. Among the Murtipujaka Śvētāmbaras, the Tristutik Gaccha sect (both historical founded by Silagana and Devabhadra, and the modern sect organised by Rajendrasuri) object to the worship of shruta-devatas.

Shasan devatas in Jainism
In Jainism, there are twenty-four yakshas and twenty-four yakshis that serve as śāsanadevatās for the twenty-four tirthankaras: These yakshas are as follows:

In poems
In Kālidāsa's poem Meghadūta, for instance, the yakṣa narrator is a romantic figure, pining with love for his missing beloved. By contrast, in the didactic Hindu dialogue of the Yakṣapraśnāḥ ""Questions of the Yakṣa"", it is a tutelary spirit of a lake that challenges Yudhiṣṭhira.
In Mahavamsa poem of Sri Lanka, a local population is given the term Yakkhas. Prince Vijaya encountered the royalty of the yakkhas' queen, Kuveni, in her capital of Lanka pura and conquered them.

In Nepal
In Nepal, squat stone versions of yakshas (sometimes twinned) were used as elements in construction. Their role was that of a caryatid, which supports a part of the building, for example a column. However, they are best known for their appearance under the spouts of ancient drinking fountains, especially fountains built in the Licchavi era (c. 400–750 AD). Bhagiratha sculptures are more commonly found under spouts from the Malla period (c. 1201–1779 AD).

In Thailand
Yakshas (Thai: ยักษ์, RTGS: Yak) are an important element in Thai temple art and architecture. They are common as guardians of the gates in Buddhist temples throughout the country since at least the 14th century. Ceramic sculptures of guardian yakshas were produced in Thailand, during the Sukhothai and Ayutthaya periods, between the 14th and 16th centuries, at several kiln complexes in northern Thailand. They are mostly depicted with a characteristic face, having big round bulging eyes and protruding fangs, as well as a green complexion. Yakshas and their female counterparts are common in the Buddhist literature of Thailand, such as in The Twelve Sisters and Phra Aphai Mani. As ogres, giants, and ogresses, yakshas are present as well in Thai folklore.
yo yak  ""ย ยักษ์"" is also used as an illustration in order to name the letter ย, the 34th consonant of the Thai alphabet, according to the traditional letter symbols Thai children use to memorise the alphabet.

In Sri Lanka
Yakshas are regarded as one of the ancient clans of Sri Lanka. The word ""Yagasha"" has been found in a cave inscription in Tamketiya in Nailgala, Kaltota written in early Brahmi script. Professor Raj Somadeva translates the word as 'belonging
to Yakshas' or 'who wrote this inscription are Yakshas'. In Sinhalese, Demons
are also known as yakshayo (Singular: Yakshaya).

In Buddhism
The three sites of Bharhut, Sanchi, and Mathura, have yielded huge numbers of Yakshi figures, most commonly on the railing pillars of stupas. These show a clear development and progression that establishes certain characteristics of the Yakshi figure such as her nudity, smiling face and evident (often exaggerated) secondary sexual characteristics that lead to their association with fertility. The yakshi is usually shown with her hand touching a tree branch, in a sinuous tribhanga pose, thus some authors hold that the young girl at the foot of the tree is based on an ancient tree deity.
Yakshis were important in early Buddhist monuments as a decorative element and are found in many ancient Buddhist archaeological sites. They became Salabhanjikas (sal tree maidens) with the passing of the centuries, a standard decorative element of both Indian sculpture and Indian temple architecture.
The sal tree (Shorea robusta) is often confused with the ashoka tree (Saraca indica) in the ancient literature of the Indian Subcontinent. The position of the Salabhanjika is also related to the position of Queen Māyā of Sakya when she gave birth to Gautama Buddha under an asoka tree in a garden in Lumbini, while grasping its branch.

List of yakshini found in Buddhist literature
Below is a nonexhaustive list of yakshinis found in Buddhist literature:

In Hinduism
In the Uddamareshvara Tantra, thirty-six yakshinis are described, including their mantras and ritual prescriptions. A similar list of yakshas and yakshinis are given in the Tantraraja Tantra, where it says that these beings are givers of whatever is desired. They are the guardians of the treasure hidden in the earth.They can be Sattvik, Rajas or Tamas in nature.

36 Yakshinis
The sadhak can take yakshini as mother, sister or wife before commencing it. Proper mantra dikshaa from guru can speed up the mantra siddhi. They can be invoked with mantra ""Om hreem shreem nityadravae mada (yakshini name) shreem hreem"". The list of thirty six yakshinis given in the Uddamareshvara Tantra is as follows, along with some of the associated legends:

In Jainism
In Jainism, there are twenty-five yakshis, including Panchanguli, Chakreshvari, Ambika, and Padmavati, who are frequently represented in Jain temples. Each is regarded as the guardian goddess of one of the present tirthankar Shri Simandhar Swami and twenty-four Jain tirthankara.

Legendary yakshis of south India
In the literature and folktales of Kerala, yakshis are generally not considered benevolent. Many folk stories feature murdered women reborn as vengeful yakshis, some of which are listed below. Aside from those mentioned below, yakshis are also featured in Malayatoor Ramakrishnan's 1967 novel Yakshi, which describes their world as having a blue sun, carpets of crimson grass, streams of molten silver, and flowers made of sapphires, emeralds, garnets, and topaz. In the novel, young yakshis fly around on the backs of giant dragonflies. According to Ramakrishnan's novel, adult yakshis are required to enter the land of the living once a year to feed on the blood of human men.

Chempakavally Ammal and Neelapilla Ammal
According to a legend from Thekkalai, next to Nagercoil in Tamil Nadu, a pair of beautiful sisters named Chempakavally and Neelapilla turned into vengeful yakshis after becoming victims of an honor killing by their father. Since their father killed them to keep them from the clutches of the lustful raja of the region, the sister yakshis tortured and killed everyone in the palace, and their father as well. The two yakshis haunted the place where they were killed until they were placated somewhat by many poojas and rituals and a temple constructed on the site. Idols of the sister yakshis are present inside. The older sister, Chempakavally, eventually transformed into a benevolent deity and traveled to Mount Kailash to worship Lord Shiva, while the younger sister, Neelapilla, remained ferocious. It is said that some of Neelapilla's devotees offer her the fingernail clippings or locks of hair from their enemies, beseeching her to destroy them.

Kalliyankattu Neeli
One of the most famous stories of legendary Yakshis of Kerala is that of Kalliyankattu Neeli, a powerful demoness who was fabled to have finally been stopped by the legendary priest Kadamattathu Kathanar. The Yakshi theme is the subject of popular Keralite tales, like the legend of the Yakshi of Trivandrum, as well as of certain movies in modern Malayalam cinema.

Kanjirottu Yakshi
Mangalathu Sreedevi or Chiruthevi, also known as Kanjirottu Yakshi is a yakshi from the folklore of Kerala. According to legend, she was born into a Padamangalam Nair tharavad by name Mangalathu at Kanjiracode in South Travancore. She was also known as Chiruthevi. She was a ravishingly beautiful courtesan who had an intimate relationship with Raman Thampi, son of King Rama Varma and rival of Anizhom Thirunal Marthanda Varma. Made arrogant by her beauty and the adoration heaped on her by men, she enjoyed toying with men's lives and driving them to financial ruin.
However, Chiruthevi was truly in love with Kunjuraman, her palanquin-bearer, who was already married and uninterested in her romantically. In frustration, Chiruthevi arranged to have Kunjuraman's wife killed. Kunjuraman finally agreed to sleep with Chiruthevi, but then murdered her to avenge his wife. 
Immediately after her death, Chiruthevi was reborn as a yakshi in the village of Kanjirottu, where she magically transformed into a beautiful woman mere moments after her birth. She terrorized men and drank their blood, and continued to harass Kunjuraman. Her frenzy only subsided after she made a deal with her brother Mangalathu Govindan, a close associate of Kunjuraman and a great upāsaka (follower) of Lord Balarama. According to their agreement she would cohabit with Kunjuraman for a year on the condition that she would become a devotee of Narasimha after the year was up. The yakshi was installed at a temple which later came to be owned by Kanjiracottu Valiaveedu, though this temple no longer exists.

Sundara Lakshmi, an accomplished dancer and consort of HH Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma, was an ardent devotee of Kanjirottu Yakshi Amma.
The Kanjirottu yakshi is now said to reside in Vault B of Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, which supposedly also contains an enormous treasure. The enchanting and ferocious forms of this Yakshi are painted on the south-west part of Sri Padmanabha's shrine. The vault remains unopened due to ongoing legal issues and the legend of the Yakshi, whom some believe will wreak havoc on the world if her prayers to Lord Narasimha within Vault B are disturbed by opening the vault.

Beyond the Indian subcontinent and Hinduism
In China, Taiwan, and Japan yakshni are famous and well-known, such as Hariti, one of the Twenty-Four Protective Deities who are venerated as defenders of the Buddhist dharma in Mahayana Buddhism. The Kishimojin (Hariti) temple in Zoushigaya, Tokyo is dedicated to her. 
In Thailand, yakshni are known and worshiped as deity guardians in Tai Folk religion and Thai folklore, showing the influence of Buddhism and Hinduism on Thai culture. Yakshini have spirit houses and shrines devoted to them as Tutelary deities in Thai folk religion. Examples include Nang Phisuea Samudra (ศาลนางผีเสื้อสมุทร), considered the deity guardian of Phisuea Samut Fort, Phra Samut Chedi District, Samut Prakan Province, Seang Chan Beach in Mueang Rayong district, and Rayong province; Nang Suphanapsron chomtevi (นางสุพรรณอัปสรจอมเทวี), considered the deity guardian of Wat Nang thakian (วัดนางตะเคียน) in Mueang Samut Songkhram district, and Samut Songkhram province; and Nang Panturat (ศาลนางพันธุรัตน์) from the Sang Thong, considered the deity guardian of Khao Nang Panthurat Forest Park, Khao Yai Sup district, Cha-am district, and Phetchaburi province.
In Myanmar, yakshni are known and worshiped as deity guardians in Myanmar folk religion and Burmese folklore, showing the influence of Buddhism and Hinduism on Burmese culture. Examples include Popa Medaw, the deity guardian of Popa mountain, and the yakshni deity guardian of the Shwedagon Pagoda.

傳說
阿達里歐是祂羅巴林湖神(即小鬼湖)，也是「魯凱族」族人的祖靈─百步蛇王。千年來獨自居住在鬼湖地帶守護著魯凱族人。面目清秀斯文、英俊挺拔；但個性冷漠寡言。以前常有村人不小心在鬼湖森林迷路，都是受了他的恩惠才找到出路。平日最大的娛樂便是獨自吹奏著短笛，應和著笛聲哼出自編的幾首歌曲。
在巴冷十六歲那年，因為在田地旁的鬼湖森林迷路，而邂逅了祂羅巴林湖神－百步蛇王阿達里歐。經過了幾段曲折離奇的遭遇後，兩人對彼此皆產生好感，並漸漸萌生出了愛情。然而百步蛇後代的魯凱族人基於對祖靈的敬畏，讓兩人的愛情面臨了重重險阻。最後，頭目朗拉路在湖神帶著禮品前來提親時向祂提出一個要求：找到傳說中的帕利奇－莫利莫利達安，也就是位於深海中的七彩琉璃珠，以作為迎娶巴冷公主的禮品。
於是蛇王帶領著部下歷經了三年的海上生涯後，終於順利帶著七彩琉璃珠回到了達德勒部落。在婚禮舉行過後，蛇王揹起巴冷，在村人及頭目夫婦的祝福聲中緩緩進入了鬼湖，並在臨走告訴村人以後可以自由進出鬼湖森林一帶打獵或摘取藥草。從此兩人就在此守護著世世代代的魯凱族人。直到今天，魯凱族少女還是會以百合花裝飾及打扮，以紀念難忘的巴冷公主。

地點
傳說中五使嶼位於蘇澳外海，天氣好時還可以看見，曾有基隆的漁夫在捕魚時無意間到達當地。

地形
五使嶼的周長約百里（五十公里）左右，周圍有五個海灣，只有兩個可以繫舟、其餘的充滿礁石只能以竹筏進入；島上有五座山峰和廣大的綠地，還有壯觀的瀑布。氣候則跟台灣本島差不多。除此之外，據說五使嶼旁還有個更小的沙嶼，樣子就像馬坐臥在地上。

生態
五使嶼上有龍鬚狀的草，可以編織草蓆、還有紅色的荔枝林，果實大而甜美，但也有人的外型、有著長及肩膀的毛髮、黑色臉部且表情猙獰的怪物，被稱為五使嶼上的「生人」。
島上雖然有曾有人居住的瓦屋，但裡面的家具都是數百年前的東西，一碰就會化成灰

傳說歷史
據說五使嶼的名字來自於宋朝時曾有叫楊五使的人居住在該島上。而在近代最早是英國船隻偶然經過該島、繪測地圖，並命名為「阿美島」，也有瑞典的船隻曾經經過。1884年（光緒十年），上海的申報報導了五使嶼的事情，清朝政府為了防止列強搶先得到島嶼而命令台灣巡撫派人考察，最後由潮州人李錦堂從英國獲得島圖前往，但經過數年都沒有消息，就這樣無疾而終。

現代研究
有人從傳說中五使嶼的地點和地形特徵判斷五使嶼是八重山群島的其中一個島嶼。

五孔洞是位於蘭嶼北方的一系列海蝕洞，當地人分別給每個洞口不同的名稱，第一個洞為vaRai no volai，意思是是蛇窩，第二個洞是族人休息的地方，第三洞為「相撲洞」，源自傳說中朗島部落與椰油部落若有衝突時會在此角力相撲分勝負，第四個不知名，第五個則稱之為Pangsangsadan，意思為杵小米之地，傳說附近村莊的老人常在此洞打小米，但這裡也被稱為「惡靈之窩」，婦女孩童不宜久留。

傳說
傳說過去紅頭部落的石生人祖先，要自己的兩個孫子去找食物，孫子找了一整天沒有收穫，在五孔洞附近就地休息，發現洞裡有光亮著，他們走進一看，發現有個女鬼正拿著「會發亮的木材」在岸邊抓螃蟹、撿貝類，他們上前去跟女鬼攀談，並且詢問那是甚麼東西，女鬼便要他們進去洞裡找她祖父。洞裡有很多鬼在唱歌跳舞，他們的臉色和身體看起來很可怕，但其中的老祖父不僅歡迎兩兄弟的到來，還親自教導他們火的使用方法（煮食物、照明等）與注意事項（會燒傷人），並且帶著他們參觀五孔洞，五孔洞裡有許多達悟族當時還沒有的風俗文化，如蓋房子、工作房與涼臺、造船、織布、劈柴、打小米、採芋頭或地瓜、宰殺家畜、耕種、收割、舉行慶典等，這些日後都成為了達悟族重要的生活文化。
後來，兩兄弟要離開時，跟鬼借了一把火，但火在回到部落前就熄滅了，他們又回去借，老祖父便教他們用乾樹枝讓火繼續燒的方法，他們才成功把火帶回部落，並且用剛得到的火幫家人煮食物。

其他版本
另有版本的傳說認為兩兄弟是來自Jipaptok山（石生人被天神丟到的山）在天上其中一個太陽變成月亮之後，因為無法煮熟食物，導致他們的父母生病想喝開水而出門尋找，並且受五孔洞的鬼送了火把後回到家裡煮水，終於治好了父母，從此以後達悟族在舉辦任何祭典時都會為魔鬼準備一份供品；也有找到火的人不是兄弟，而是兩位女性，她們也在五孔洞逗留五天左右、並且族人還在日後發明鑽木取火的說法；另外有版本的取火傳說跟五孔洞完全無關，火是祖先無意間鑽木而取得的、或是在大洪水退去、族人下山時，不小心踩到一個未穩固的石頭，石頭滾下去砸到樹而得到了冒煙的木炭，而最先得到火的朗島部落也藉此發現了飛魚。

傳說
水火雙蛇版本
傳說有位排灣族青年名叫布魯（Ural），極其聰明。有日布魯的母親生病，在醫治無果後聽聞仙奶泉醫百病的功效，因此決定前去獲取。路途間出現一位烏鴉婆告知水火雙蛇的存在與制服之法。於是在某部落找到正在刺毬的鳳（Pan），在鳳的協助下向太陽神取得金鎖且制伏了雙蛇。然在醫治好母親後，布魯與鳳姑娘為了族人而不願歸還金鎖，故而遭到太陽神懲戒，一道雷劈下後，鳳姑娘變成了鳳梨，而布魯則成為了鳳梨下的土壤。

水虎火龍版本
其內容與水火雙蛇版本極為相似，僅差在青年的名字為武達（另一說為麻達），且鳳姑娘是由被雲豹所咬傷的鳳凰所變成。

爭議
西拉雅國家風景區管理處曾於2007年在關子嶺景點水火同源旁設立「龍虎鬥」景觀意象，然在2011年9月遭到當地民代認為與火麒麟傳說不合，故而要求改正，其中臺南市議員張世賢更明確指出從未聽說過龍虎鬥的故事。

內容
相傳明末清初（相當於荷治時期）時，荷蘭公主「瑪格麗特」為了尋找愛人「威雪林」而來到臺灣，船隻卻在大灣（即大灣遊憩區）遇到風浪觸礁擱淺，船員發出求救煙火，引來當時的龜仔甪社（今社頂自然公園）的原住民襲擊遇害。原住民原本不殺女子，但當一夥人抬著戰利品返回部落，其中一名原住民男子因獵物不多，又折回海邊搜尋，恰巧碰上逃過一劫的瑪格麗特，勇士為了顏面及炫耀，於是開了殺戒，並帶回她身上八樣物品：荷蘭木鞋、絲綢頭巾、珍珠項鍊、寶石戒指、皮箱、寶石耳墜、羽毛筆和紙。故謂之「八寶公主」。
日治時期的1934年，這位荷蘭公主曾經向一位漁民託夢，表示想回到荷蘭，希望當地居民能幫她打造一艘船。居民照辦且船也出發後，她又託夢說願意留下來，庇祐當地居民，居民蓋了間廟以為紀念。
該廟位於墾丁大灣遊憩區海灘附近的一座萬應公祠，當地人俗稱八寶公主廟。祠內供奉一幅書有「荷公主女」之橫聯。1981年重修，成為一座「三合一」廟，主位拜萬應公，一旁拜土地公，一旁拜八寶公主。但廟內的八寶公主像穿著戲服化的漢服，而非她生前所穿的荷蘭服裝。

研究
雖然民間的傳說對該人物的時代有明確定位，且指出是荷蘭人，但真實性不明。
然而，根據《恆春縣志》載羅發號事件：「同治初年，有外國番船一隻，遭風飄至鵝鑾鼻一帶，被龜仔角番戕殺多命。內有番女一名，其上下牙齒，不分顆數，各連一排。龜仔角番見而異之，懸首示人。嗣該船逃回本國，興師復仇，至鵝鑾鼻、大坂埒一帶，荊棘滿山，四無人蹤。一日，聞雞鳴聲，遂發兵通道，尋聲而進。得龜仔角社，戮番人，無噍類。走脫孕婦一人，延續至今，亦僅三、四十番。故社中禁，不畜雞。相傳被殺番女，為該國公主云云。」
加上荷蘭官方曾表示荷蘭公主「瑪格麗特」並未到過台灣，因此學界從《恆春縣志》所載，以此推論認為八寶公主應該就是羅發號事件其船船長約瑟·杭特（Joseph Hunt）的妻子梅西·杭特（Mercy G. Beerman Hunt）。

高雄捷運於左營＝世運兩站間，設有穿越半屏山之全線唯一山岳隧道，全長756公尺。世運站於設計階段時，曾暫名為半屏山站。

名稱
源自台語「半爿」（puànn-pîng），就是「半邊」的意思，後來雅化成同音的「半屏」。新北市瑞芳區另有一山稱為「半平山」，語源相同。

歷史
起源
半屏山地質主要屬古亭坑層沉積岩，沉積之時氣候較冷，沒有珊瑚礁生長；後來因造山運動而使沉積層隆起，水深變淺，並接著氣候轉暖，高雄石灰岩開始生成。於一百三十萬年前全球海進期，珊瑚礁垂直生長，形成高雄石灰岩中部及下部，之後，因海水面之上升趨緩，珊瑚礁側向生長，遂生成上部高雄石灰岩及半屏山、大小崗山石灰岩，接著因大量碎屑物進入而結束了珊瑚礁生長，進而沉積崎腳層。高雄石灰岩之估算沉積速率為一千年1.72公尺。因此珊瑚要生成半屏山石灰岩，需要長達數萬年的時間。

開採石灰岩
早在清朝時期半屏山下都是鑿石場和煉灰場（以石灰石煉製石灰），除了供當地使用外，並以牛車載運銷售他地，範圍從左營沿海線北到臺灣府城（今臺南市），南到阿猴城（今屏東市），開採咾咕石也從半屏山延伸到蛇山及壽山下（內惟埤）。
1917年日本淺野水泥工廠完工，并開採水泥。壽山由日本政府開採，二戰結束後半屏山則設置建台水泥、東南水泥和正泰水泥廠並且取得開採權，整個煉灰的工廠和鑿石場漸漸消失，成為以後的水泥廠。

山崩
民國50年（1961年）6月4日，半屏山發生山崩，造成42人死亡，也造成台鐵縱貫線鐵路被掩覆變形約1000公尺，鄰近崩塌地400公尺面積約15萬平方公尺之農田被破壞；而1966年8月22日又發生一次山崩，崩塌規模較前次小。半屏山的地質是傾斜之石灰岩覆蓋於泥岩上，由於石灰岩是強度及透水性相當高的岩層，而其底下之泥岩是強度及透水性皆低的地層。
下雨時雨水會下滲到石灰岩及泥岩之交界面再向下流動，使得泥岩表面由於吸水軟化而更弱，因此石灰岩與泥岩之交界面就容易形成山崩之滑動面。當山腳下之石灰岩，被水泥公司逐漸採去做水泥原料之後，其底部之支撐漸漸減弱，終於無法負荷其上方之重量而下滑。
自從該次山崩後，在取得軍方同意開放後水泥公司改變了採石方法，改採由上而下逐次開採，因此已無重大山崩事故再發生。

復原
過去為因應經濟發展的需要，半屏山曾是國內重要的石灰礦區，經長期採礦挖掘的結果，原有自然生態遭嚴重破壞，原本特殊的山形也不復在。半屏山的採礦權於1997年終止，隨後進行礦區植生綠化。半屏山之西北麓由高雄市政府設置自然公園，東南麓除護坡植生綠化外，亦由水泥業者開挖滯洪沉砂池以確保水土安全。沉砂池於2006年由高雄市政府規劃成立半屏湖溼地公園。

國家自然公園
內政部在 2011 年 9 月 20 日核定設置「壽山國家自然公園」，壽山國家自然公園籌備處並於 11 月 1 日進駐，同年的 12 月 6 日舉行壽山國家自然公園的開園典禮，第一座國家自然公園便就此誕生，也將臺灣的國家公園體系帶入另一個新階段。

半屏湖溼地
依照《水土保持法》規定，半屏山礦區於民國八十六年（1997年）中止採礦後，大部分仍為裸露地，為避免表土於暴雨時隨地表逕流排放至下游地區造成災害，原半屏山舊礦區應辦理善後水土保持處理，於各集水分區下方設置沉沙滯洪池。
有效的總滯洪量約二十萬立方公尺，該滯洪量應可承受重現期五十年不同降雨延時之單獨暴雨事件；至於重現期一百年至兩百年，則約尚可分別承受降雨延時六小時及四小時之單獨平均暴雨事件，其累積雨量分別為四百零二毫米及三百六十四毫米。
半屏湖濕地乃原半屏山舊礦區停止開採後，執行礦區水土保持計畫所規劃之滯洪沈砂池。2005年高雄市水利技師公會受託進行「建臺水泥公司邊半屏山南麓沈砂池兼作濕地公園之可行性評估」，結果認為實質可行，於是2006年高雄市政府進行規劃成立「半屏湖濕地公園」。
原滯洪沈砂池滯洪池位於東北—西南走向之半屏山麓下，池頂標高約16至18公尺，總面積約7.8公頃，若包含週邊陸域所需的生態緩衝區、教育解說系統及維修動線等，合計約為12公頃。目前有五座滯洪沉砂池，作為人工濕地工程之規劃設計。

傳說
貪心的人吃掉半座山
以前半屏山並不是現在這個樣子，不知道哪一天起，半屏山的山腳下突然出現一位賣湯圓的老人。他做生意的方式非常奇怪，一文錢，只能買一粒湯圓，兩文錢兩個，三個不用錢。這個消息很快就傳遍鄰里，大家都爭相來吃這位老人賣的湯圓，當然，每個人都是直接買三顆，沒有一個人是只付一文錢的。雖然大家從不曾看過這位老人買過任何做湯圓的材料，不知道這些湯圓從哪裡來，但因為湯圓實在太便宜，大家也不去在意。
有一天，有位年輕人走到這個湯圓擔子，雖然他有足夠的錢，卻只拿出了一文錢買湯圓。即使老人不斷的慫恿買三顆不用錢，比起用一文錢買一顆要更划算，年輕人依然不為所動，最後仍用一文錢買了一粒湯圓，連買了五次。
事實上，那名老人是位仙人，是為了尋找心地善良的人作為徒弟，才打扮成老人。因此仙人便收年輕人為徒弟，領著這位年輕人，緩緩升天了。至於其他人吃的湯圓，其實是山上的泥土做成的，當大家發現這一切時，整座山也已經被吃掉一大塊了。剩下的模樣，就是缺了一半的半屏山。而被吃掉的部分，就是今日高鐵左營站、世運場館和大中路以北的左營、仁武地區。

和尚跳崩
在半屏山洞裡住了位和尚，靠著石縫裡湧出的白米過日子。這石縫說來奇妙，每天湧出的白米正好夠他一天的食量。有一天，和尚起了貪念，把石縫挖大，希望湧出更多的白米。沒想到這一挖，石縫卻再也湧不出米來，氣得和尚暴跳如雷。這一跳居然把山給跳崩了，使得半屏山變成今天的奇形怪狀。

雷公劈斷
半屏山原本是一座高峻雄偉的山嶽，可是心胸狹窄，對於「打狗山」被稱為「群山主峰」，心中很不是滋味，於是他強邀打狗山比個高低。幾天下來，半屏山越長越高，竟然撞上天庭，玉皇大帝一怒之下，叫雷公把它轟下，雷公拿起雷鎚一敲，轟隆一聲，囂張的半屏山從此成了「半身不遂」的怪模樣。

仙人貶為山岳
很久以前，有一女二男的仙人相約下凡，女的美麗嬌豔，男的一個年輕英俊，另一個則是滿頭銀髮的仙翁。後來，老少兩位仙人都愛上仙女，在爭風吃醋下大打出手，結果老仙翁道行高深，一劍把年輕仙人劈成兩半。這場惡鬥驚動了天帝，一氣之下把三位仙人貶為山嶽，仙女化為「鳳山」，老仙翁化為「旗後山」，至於那位被劈掉半邊身子的年輕仙人，就是現在的「半屏山」。

解山王
傳說半屏山上住有靈獸和滅火神解山王，靈獸曾鳴叫示警，解山王則滅火，使居民逃離火災。日後，居民因此豎立其泥像，以守護半屏山。

各傳說的其他說法
軍事設施遺跡
半屏山上遺留許多日治時期的戰備設施遺跡，分別屬於高雄要塞防禦設施，高雄要港(左營軍港)水道設施及日本海軍第六燃料廠於二戰時期設置的疏散工場。

傳說
起因
傳說過去卡那卡那富族人還住在納諸納（natsunga，今內本鹿地區以東）時，某天河裡突然由來了一條巨大的鰻魚、堵住了河水，導致河水暴漲、淹沒了許多地方，卡那卡那富族人也和不少動物一起逃往藤包山（naüsurana，又稱珠勞𡛡山，今亦稱鞍輪名山）上。

火種
洪水期間，受困於山上的卡那卡那富族因為沒有火種、沒辦法煮飯，所以打算找人幫忙去有火的達努英茲山上取火，山羊隨即自願前往，並且成功游了過去、將火種取回，人類因此得以下廚。

水退
因為洪水遲遲不退，人們和野獸再度聚集起來討論對策，這時野豬自告奮勇去擊退鰻魚，知道自己將有去無回的牠也要求族人讓牠的後代永遠都有食物吃，族人答應了，野豬便跳進河中，和巨鰻纏鬥起來，最後終於咬斷了牠的身體、殺了巨鰻，洪水終於開始退去，而牠和巨鰻也一起被水沖走了。

後續
洪水退去以後，卡那卡那富族和動物們下山了，卡那卡那富族表示以後會重新開始獵殺動物，讓動物們都很害怕，一聞到他們的味道就會躲得遠遠的。

其他
卡那卡那富族的洪水傳說跟鄒族、拉阿魯哇族等鄰近的族群相當類似，特別是拉阿魯哇族，洪水退去原因和情節都基本雷同，在卡那卡那富族的始祖東來說中，拉阿魯哇族和卡那卡那富族原本是生活在納諸納，只是因為洪水期間他們逃到了tanugintsu（疑似卑南主山）上，才就此與卡那卡那富族分道揚鑣。

外表與習性
吳賽嶼青人雖然有著人類的外型，但身形相當粗壯、就像熊一樣，全身青黑色的，連血也是青紫色。
他們沒有穿衣物的習慣，會招手引誘人們走進洞穴中並用巨石把洞穴關起來，僅留一個小縫隙，當有人想從其中出來的時候就將他吃掉。

傳說
據說在劉銘傳當台灣巡撫時，南部有商船因遇上颱風而漂流到吳賽嶼，船上的人在島上遇到青人，並且被他引誘進山洞中關起來，吃了一個想逃出去的人，大家為了逃命而合力推動堵住洞口的巨石，將它推向吃飽後正在睡覺的青人將其壓死，一行人在逃回船上的途中又被另一個青人追趕，在他們打算出航時還抓住左舷想要上船，但被一個水手用斧頭砍斷一根手指而逃走。

後續
這個消息傳到滬尾後，有個劉姓的艋舺人跟劉銘傳報告這件事，當時正值劉銘傳大力開山撫番的時期，他隨即命令劉姓人士帶兵前往開拓吳賽嶼，但最後只到達一個景色類似、但沒看到任何怪物的荒島，且因當地瘴氣過重，認為有不少毒蛇猛獸而放棄開拓離開，後來再也沒有人前往吳賽嶼過。

現代研究
據說因為吳賽嶼的傳說，當時台灣流傳著以「吳賽嶼青人」來罵人不通事理就像未經教化的原人的習慣，台語裡至今也有以「青番（tshenn-huan）」罵人我行我素、無法溝通的方法，因此吳賽嶼青人也有可能是醜化或妖魔化台灣原住民的形象並因此延伸出來的故事。

傳說與民俗
在福州的民間普遍說法認為：「地下有一隻地牛擔著土地，這邊肩膀挑累了，換一邊肩膀」，因此地震在福州被稱作「地牛轉肩」，在寧德福安被稱作「地牛轉身」（福安方言志記載是「地牛轉世」）。但在台灣比較普遍的說法認為，地牛在地底下睡覺，每當牠翻身或是因為身體發癢而搔癢時，就會引發地震。同時也在台灣也經常被稱作「地牛翻身」或「地牛聳毛」。而民間也衍生許多如打地牛、學牛的叫聲等安撫地牛的民俗，在921大地震後，竹山當地藝文協會也曾在連興宮媽祖廟前舉辦打地牛儀式；而在綠島另有說法認為地牛不止一隻，而地震是因為地牛互相打鬥而引起的，所以居民會拿金屬製的臉盆敲打以分開牠們。
傳說中，位於台南市東山區水雲村的牛肉崎就是地牛棲息的位置，而1906年嘉義梅仔坑大地震時，也有人聲稱在山上地裂開的地方發現一條巨大的牛尾巴，認為是地牛的牛尾。

現代研究
雖然地牛很像是漢人帶來的傳說，但研究指出，中國的傳說中有關地震的記載幾乎都跟地牛無關（与鰲魚有關），相較之下，許多台灣原住民族卻都有與地牛相關的地震傳說，如賽夏族、鄒族（稱地牛為「哇茲姆」）、布農族、南勢阿美族、賽德克族、卑南族、部分平埔族等；而相近的金門地區、或是清領時期漢人對地震的記載中，卻只有如「地生牛毛（或豬毛）」等記載，因此現在的地牛傳說最早很有可能是源自原住民，漢人來到台灣後逐漸和原住民文化混合而成的結果。

其他傳說
在台灣的其他原住民傳說中，也有其他與地牛類似、但動物不同的地震傳說，如泰雅族認為地震是地底的熊、海中的鹿或鯉魚造成的；也有部分阿美族和巴宰族認為是地底的大山豬（巴宰族稱其為巴魯匝庫）造成的；而布農族除了地牛傳說之外，也有認為地震是巨蟹捕食巨蛇造成的說法，部分說法中那些巨獸除了地震之外、也是洪水的起因，有可能是指隨著地震而來的海嘯或是河道阻塞造成的洪水。
另外，在大衛．萊特對台灣當地人（西拉雅族）的紀錄中也有提到，地震的起因是因為地牛被一隻金雞啄而動起身子的。目前金雞的傳說已經消失，僅剩地牛傳說。

傳說
清朝年間，金門有個叫洪興佐的世家子弟，仗著自己家族勢力作威作福，經常凌虐家裡的奴僕。有一天他把一個叫新兒的婢女溺死在井裡，還把屍體隨意丟棄在沙堆中，第二年，洪興佐突然生了場大病臥病在床，這時有一隻怪鳥開始定居在洪家的屋簷下，不僅每天聒噪吵鬧、還作勢要攻擊他，只有向牠喊新兒的名字時那隻鳥才會對其他人有反應，後來家人找來的巫師說那隻鳥是枉死的新兒魂魄所變成、要來向洪興佐索命的。洪興佐雖然誠心悔改，但在鬼鳥離開三天後還是死了，那天還是他去年殺死新兒的日子。

外觀與能力
墓坑鳥是從陰間回到人間的怨靈所變成，牠花色短尾、鳥喙長而眼紅如血，叫聲尖銳淒厲，會給生前害死自己的人帶來災禍，將那些人詛咒致死。

原型與現代研究
金門鬼鳥的原型很可能是來自於戴勝鳥，該鳥在繁殖期時經常在土穴或樹洞中築巢，因此也經常出現在墓地，再加上親鳥會以惡臭來驅趕敵人，因此被視為不祥的象徵，有可能因為這樣而造就了牠怨靈復仇的傳說。

外觀與能力
有關婆娑鳥的大小記載不一，有身形大如雁的、也有小到跟鶯差不多大小的，但牠們的雄性都有如鳳凰一般的五色羽毛、雌性的羽毛則是灰黑色的。另外，牠們鳴啼可以吸引百鳥聚集、對牠們獻出抓來的食物，就算婆娑鳥飛走也會在身旁跟隨。

分布
有關婆娑鳥的記載主要出現在台灣中部地區的山林裡，據說乾隆51年（1786年）有一次現身紀錄，因為在那之後彰化很快爆發了林爽文事件，有人認為婆娑鳥是戰禍來臨的預兆。

原型

從牠們的大小和身體特徵的記載判斷，婆娑鳥的原型很有可能是孔雀和五色鳥。。

外表
安平大牛高可達五、六尺（約1.5到1.8公尺），面容就跟豬一樣、雙耳寬大且有編竹覆蓋、嘴中還有尖牙，雖然皮膚跟正常的牛一樣粗糙，但卻有水獺般的毛皮，腳則像是烏龜等爬蟲類的爪子。
此外，據說牠也有在能水面上飛行的能力。

現身案例
安平大牛首先出現在1712年（康熙51年）7月時，造成當地居民的恐慌，有人連忙用木棍攻擊或用繩索捕捉，但木棍一打在牠的身上就碎了，也沒能抓到，怪牛最後跑到海邊，用後腳直立起身，大喊三次後死亡，沒人知道牠的來歷。
另外，在1721年（康熙60年）3月時，怪牛又出現在台南，牠跳進河中，一路游到海口出海，最後消失無蹤，因為在那之後不久隨即發生朱一貴事件，因此有人認為牠是戰亂的前兆。

類似案例
據說在1923年（大正12年）7月時，有隻怪牛出現在今台東地區的南鄉何家莊，牠的樣子跟當地養的牛隻都不一樣，皮還硬的連長劍都傷不了，在當時引來幾百名當地民眾聚集在河邊圍觀，稱呼牠為「龍王大將」，而沒過多久，怪牛又潛入了水中消失不見。

傳說
關於宜蘭龜怪的傳說有很多版本，其中最知名的是牠原本在外海吐著霧氣，並在鄭成功率軍經過宜蘭時逼近軍隊，造成威脅，鄭成功便開槍將其射殺（也有說法是用他所有的大砲：龍碽），重傷的龜怪沉入水中後又浮起來，不再吐霧，變成了龜山島，而牠產的兩個蛋變成西南角的礁石（已於1943年被水雷破壞），當初被鄭成功打出來的洞則成為龜山島上的龜潭。

其他傳說
另有其他版本的傳說中，宜蘭龜怪是因為鄭成功佔領台灣後蒐集島上許多珍奇物種去日本慶祝，但該龜怪不肯就範，而牠的心意感動上天，被變成了石頭，而鄭成功為了洩憤而砲轟龜山島，造成龜山島南方的海蝕洞、或是鄭成功想撮合牠和出現在野柳岬的公龜精，牽著牠往野柳移動，但到半路上龜怪就停下來不走了，鄭成功生氣的拿大砲打牠，不小心把牠打死、也有說法認為龜山島當初協助鄭成功跟荷蘭人作戰，負責運輸補給，但因為牠行動緩慢耽擱了時間，造成鄭成功一氣之下砲轟龜怪把牠打死。

現代研究
事實上，在鄭成功的信仰進入宜蘭地區前，當地便已經有「老龜化石」的傳說，或是巴賽族人在看到龜山島火山爆發後、知道漢人將來到的傳說，今日的龜怪傳說很有可能是它們在日後與鄭成功的信仰混淆了，而且，因為龜山島屬於火山島，據說到1968年為止，龜首的地方還會散發出白霧或硫磺氣體，讓附近的人無法呼吸，很有可能就是龜怪「吐霧」的由來。
另外，鄭成功撮合牠和野柳龜怪的傳說，也很有可能暗示著兩地很早以前就有航運往來。

傳說
洪水與倖存者
很久以前，在人類開始於地上繁衍後的某一天，洪水突然發生，淹死了所有的人和家畜，其中一對姐弟：本卡凱希（Sabon-kaisi，姐）、瓦奈凱希（Wana-Kaisi，弟），兩人是人類始祖的直系血親，因為爬上竹子而倖存，因此現在的竹子都是彎的。洪水本身則在六天後退去。

另一說洪水是因鰻魚堵住河水所造成，六日後螃蟹出現將鰻魚的肚臍剪斷，迫使鰻魚遊走才退洪。

安頓生活
洪水退去後，姐弟兩人在巴拉檀（Paradan，今豐原）生活，後來又遷到平地，建立「瓦窩瓦魯都爾部落（Waowarutsaru，上等部落，意為貴族居住之地）」。他們跟著鳥一起挖起地面，在地底發現許多保存下來的稻穀而得以生存下去。

結婚與產子
因為沒有對象，姐弟倆結為夫妻，並且生下了兩個孩子，他們（或螃蟹巫覡）後來又把孩子切成數塊，對屍塊吹氣下咒，屍塊就變成了一個個青年，即巴宰族的祖先。後來他們的後代建立了岸裡大社（Rahado puru/Rahodobool）、樸仔籬（Dayaopuru/Dayao-bul）、阿里史（Rarusai/Lalisai）和烏牛欄（Aoran）四個原始部落，他們合稱、互稱為下等部落（Rubarubadohat），並且逐漸擴及到台中平原

另外，巴宰族認為洪水是由水神阿普·毛(Apu-mao)親自帶來的，因此族人每年都會祭拜他，請求他把洪水送往其他地方。

內容
太陽變月亮
相傳在很久以前的太古時期，天空有兩顆大太陽，分別是太陽哥哥與太陽弟弟輪番不停照耀大地，世界沒有晝夜之分，人們苦於炎熱、花草樹木枯死、河水乾涸、農作物難以生長，但為了生存，布農族人仍不停地奮力工作，苦不堪言。
有一天，一對布農夫妻到耕地裡工作，把尚在襁褓中的次子帶往田裡照顧，並放置於耕地旁的茅草寮，夫妻耕作到一半休息時，母親要去餵食小嬰兒，卻發現小嬰兒竟不見其蹤影，只看見一隻蜥蜴正在包裏著嬰兒的布裡，便知曉她的小孩，被太陽哥哥的炎熱晒成了蜥蜴（布農語：sisiun）。父親生氣至極，便決定攜帶大兒子要去征伐太陽，以報殺子之仇。
父子倆攜帶弓和箭，踏上復仇之路，沿路種植柚子樹（布農語：izukdaing / izuksulain）和橘子樹，走過無數的河流山澗，翻越荒野山嶺，朝向太陽出沒地走了數十年，終於抵達世界盡頭，找到太陽居住地。一開始，他們躲在一顆石頭後方欲瞄射，但因陽光強烈刺眼而無法瞄準。又躲到芋頭葉下試射太陽，但還沒有瞄準好，芋頭葉就被曬的枯乾了，於是改躲到香蕉葉下，結果也是一樣。最後，他們利用了山棕（布農語：asik / asikav / a-sik-kaz）葉耐熱特性，於葉片之間的空隙瞄準太陽，太陽哥哥在未設防線下，被射中了右眼。
被射中的太陽哥哥，忍著痛伸手捉住這對父子，並大怒質問，為何無緣無故的射殺他。父親便把在兩個太陽不停照耀下酷熱難當生靈塗炭、小兒變成蜥蜴一事告訴了太陽哥哥，當太陽哥哥聽完父親的敘述之後，太陽哥哥同情這位父親的遭遇並說：「你們每天的生活都是我們能源所賜予的，使植物得以行光合作用；萬物得以生育。」眼睛中箭受傷不再那麼耀眼的太陽哥哥允諾今後不會再有兩個太陽，地上會有白天和黑夜，也送給父子一些種子，教導他們今後如何依照圓缺變化依時栽種（布農語：buan unhuman），並且要求他們依照圓缺時節變化行祭儀，生活始能豐裕。太陽哥哥回到天上，便是現在夜裡看見的月亮，少了殺氣、厲光；多了溫柔、皎潔的白光。父親也允諾月亮，回去後會按照其教導和指示，施行祭祀，這就是傳說中布農族與月亮的約定。有些故事的版本，行動成功後從世界的盡頭返回部落，父親已死，兒子也成為白髮老人。

躲藏的太陽與山羌
由於一個太陽被人射傷成月亮，另一個太陽怕的不敢升空照耀大地，於是大地陷入一片漆黑，大家無法出外工作，更尋不到食物，生活非常的困苦。
如果族人不得已一定要出門，都必須先投擲石頭，由石頭落地的聲音判斷前方是路還是深淵。一位老婆婆在大地陷入一片漆黑期間家裡的水全部用完了，不得已出門前往取水，在黑暗中沒有看到在水源頭有一隻喝水的山羌，丟出去的石頭剛巧擊中它的頭部（布農語：bungu）血流如注，山羌受不住疼痛，發出生氣的吼叫聲，這時奇怪的事情發生了，躲藏的太陽竟然被山羌的吼叫聲，嚇到跳回空中重新照耀大地，人們又恢復正常的起居，但是山羌的額頭從此留下一個美麗的疤痕。布農語稱水源頭叫sinsinsakut，所以稱山羌為sakut。

後續
月亮的鏡子
被射中右眼的太陽變成月亮，月亮每晚都會回來看看自己被射的箭傷，那一面照映月亮的鏡子便被布農族人稱呼其為「月亮的鏡子(Cidanumas buan，嘉明湖)」

月巨人
太陽被射中右眼後成為月亮，並跌落至山上變成巨人，巨人向族人索要被子（Kulig-daigaz）擦拭血液，後來巨人訓斥族人的祭祀方式與禁忌，且賜予族人琉璃珠（Matalunas）。

傳說
據說在大赤崁鄉裡有一位叫張騫的人住在赤崁龍德宮，他有個雙目失明的弟弟，平常都待在房間裡，很少跟其他人有來往。而1907年的某天，有人發現他的房間裡出現了一個奇怪的女性，她跟張騫七歲的女兒關係很好，但不知為何只會在白天的時候出現在弟弟的房間裡，晚上就不見了，如果發現有人從窗外偷看家裡，還會朝他們丟磚塊。大家都認為她是妖怪而很緊張。

後續
後來當時的大赤崁支廳長聽說這件事之後，派一位姓鈴木的調查擲出來的磚頭，發現硬得很不正常，居民因此更加確信那個人是妖怪。後來他們募集了一些錢從大倉嶼請來一位叫鄭品的人以符咒幫忙驅鬼，但當他一抵達當事人家裡，就被妖怪用磚塊打到頭而逃跑，後來事情不了了之。

現代研究
因為那位女性可以在白天出現，有人認為她並不是鬼而是類似狐妖的存在，因此稱呼她為「女妖」，但也有說法認為對方只是出現在張家裡的一位女性而已，跟妖異無關。

簡述
抱壁鬼是死後沒有前往陰間、處於陰陽交界的鬼魂，因此只能附於牆壁上、沿著牆壁走，會在黑暗中突然冒出來嚇人。

習俗
因為抱壁鬼的習性，台灣有著農曆七月時不可以靠近牆壁走或靠著牆壁休息的傳統禁忌，而台語中的抱壁鬼也衍伸出罵人突然冒出來嚇人一跳的意思。

傳說
洪水發生
過去人們並非群居生活，而是散居在玉山的東、南、北邊，直到某一天發生了大洪水，倖存的人們便集中逃往達姆斯薩庫拉巴山（玉山）以及利斯耶茲山上避難，動物也全聚集在那裡。

取火
因為人們在逃難的過程中遺失了火種，他們便思考著前往有火光在閃爍的利斯耶茲山上取火的方法，這時山羊表示自願前往，然而在山羊游過洪水取得火種、並把火種綁在角上打算帶回來時，卻因為火種太燙了而忍不住潛入水中，弄惜了火種，而牠也因為水流湍急而被沖走；這時換山羌自願去取火，人們便聚集在牠身邊撫摸牠為牠打氣，而山羌的毛皮也因此富有光澤。後來山羌便成功帶回火種給人類。

水退
洪水遲遲不退，又讓族人傷透腦筋，這時一隻大山豬表示願意去破壞河堤，讓洪水排到其他地方，但條件是要人類每天餵牠的孩子吃地瓜直到長大，人類答應了，山豬便跳進洪水中，游到河流下游把河堤弄毀，洪水這才終於退去。

下山與重建
洪水退去後，動物和人們紛紛下山，這時聚集在玉山上的人分成了三批，一批順著濁水溪下山，來到阿里山建立了達邦社（鄒族）、一批順著楠梓仙溪下山，成為了卡那卡那富族、拉阿魯哇族的祖先則是往東遷移，來到了沙蘇納（hlasʉnga：日昇之地；東方之山）地區，跟矮人族嘎卜魯阿住在一起；另有說法認為拉阿魯哇族遷到了台南定居，後來受到荷蘭人攻擊而又回到山上建立部落。
另有說法認為在萬物打算下山時，一條巨蛇主動將自己的身體拉到山下搭成橋讓其他動物方便下山，動物們也開始重建河堤，小動物啣著小石頭鋪設河底、大動物則在河岸兩側用力踏著泥土建造新的河堤，但在重建的過程中，只有老鷹飛在天空上不肯幫旁，生氣的天神因此詛咒老鷹不能喝河裡的水，只要喝了就會死；而在河堤完工後，一名叫希巴拉拉薩的女神還打算剷平毀壞的山建造平地，但卻因此惹怒了熊，並咬傷了她的兒子，讓她為了照顧兒子而停止了工作，所以現在台灣的山還是很多。

其他
拉阿魯哇族的洪水傳說跟鄒族、卡那卡那富族相當類似，而拉阿魯哇族也因此視鄒族為本族的兄弟族，部落裡的耆老也認為用古語的話，拉阿魯哇族和鄒族是可以溝通的；另外，卡那卡那富族洪水傳說中則認為拉阿魯哇族跟本族才是系出同源。

傳說
撒瑪杜姑杜姑是一位部落酋長的女兒，他們家隔壁住個一個瘋瘋癲癲的女孩，叫撒嘎哩嘎里（Sakalrikakri）。有一天撒瑪杜姑杜姑的父母要去田裡工作時，囑咐她要好好看家不要出門、也不可以讓其他人進來，可是在父母離開後，她受不了撒嘎哩嘎里的慫恿，還是開門讓她進家裡玩，並且和她一起去湖裡洗澡，而在洗澡時，撒嘎哩嘎里趁機把她推進深水區、搶走她的衣服、闖入她的家中冒充她躺在床上。
撒瑪杜姑杜姑的父母回到家後察覺有異，被識破的撒嘎哩嘎里連忙逃走了，找不到女兒的母親只好使用法術，把項鍊上的珠子拋在地上滾、每有岔路就再拋一次，好不容易來到湖邊發現撒瑪杜姑杜姑，但她那時候身上已經長滿鱗片，逐漸變成了魚。

其他
在另一版本中，撒瑪杜姑杜姑父母雙亡，家中的傭人巴卡基也長期虐待她。某日颱風天撒瑪杜姑杜姑被傭人指使去提水，在河岸邊被叔叔看見並帶回家，然而嬸嬸卻趁叔叔離家時進行各種的刁難、將其騙離家裡。於是撒瑪杜姑杜姑只能躲進父母的工寮，並在當中愈近奶奶的靈魂，並在教導下將家中的垃圾和雜草飛到嬸嬸家中，傭人見後再也不敢怠忽職守。

棲息與能力
旋風蛟平常棲息於台灣南部深山的山谷溪流裡。只要牠拍打雙翼，便會引起猛烈的颶風。

現身案例
據說旋風蛟曾在1878年（光緒四年）現身於台南，激起狂風，吹倒許多房屋大樹，直到抵達台北後才消失，在經過的路上造成相當大的損害。

現代研究與相關傳說
根據能力和記載，旋風蛟的形象很有可能是源自於颱風。其能力跟台灣漢移民的另一種傳說中的妖怪：赤虯十分類似，但前者的能力傾向於激起狂風、後者則是降下暴雨。

位置與氣候
暗澳山位於台灣東北部海域，上面無人居住，且有各種奇花異草遍布，景色相當漂亮。
但是，該島每半年才有一次日昇或日落，白天是春夏兩季、黑夜是秋冬兩季，且入夜後，不僅一片黑暗、冰雪紛飛、潛伏在島上的許多妖魔鬼怪就會出現橫行，山谷中甚至有巨蟒飛入空中，讓人無法居住。

傳說
據說過去曾有一艘荷蘭船隻在白天時經過暗澳山，覺得當地有供人居住的價值，因此派了200名原住民水手駐紮，並且給了一年份的糧食，當他隔年再度率領船隻前往當地時，卻發現四周一片漆黑，留下來的水手也都不見了，點起火把到處搜尋後，才在水手留下來的石碑上得知暗澳山的特殊情況，而留在那裡的水手早就都逃走或被當地的妖怪殺害了。
而在清領時期，有一個潮州人來台經商，遇上大風雨導致船隻翻覆，但他被一個龍女救到暗澳，並與她結婚生子，後來帶著兒子離開了十幾年後，六十歲才又回到當地。

同名地點
今澎湖的東文里和西文里在日治時期時被稱為文澳，而文澳又是在清領時期時從「暗澳」轉變而來，但跟暗澳山傳說沒有關係。

現代研究
暗澳的傳說很有可能是來自於荷蘭威廉·巴倫支船長於1596年5月開始的第三次前往北極的航行，該次航行主要目的是要尋找從北極抵達亞洲的航道，特別是傳說中連接北冰洋和太平洋的亞泥俺海峽，船隊在6/19抵達斯匹茲卑爾根島，並且在熊島因為意見分歧而分頭走，其中巴倫支率領的船隊在新地島受困，直到隔年6月才以小舟離開新地島，並於11月回到荷蘭，過程中巴倫支船長也去世了。
此航海中，有許多部份跟暗澳山傳說相當類似：

此外，亞泥俺（Anian）海峽的音譯接近「暗洋」，而其葡萄牙文則是念作Anião，音近「暗澳」，且當時的人認為亞泥俺海峽位於日本北方，而日本又位於台灣東北方，跟傳說中的暗澳山不謀而合。很有可能是荷蘭人將巴倫支船長的經歷帶來亞洲後，以訛傳訛之下變成了暗澳傳說。

傳說
臺灣相傳此女是被嫂嫂家暴虐待至死的三歲女童，因死時仍坐於竹椅上，故爲後人喚作「椅仔姑」。臺灣民間認為此女與陳姑娘、阿秀姑娘皆是三位專門保護養女的守護靈，生前都是別人家的養女或童養媳 ，皆受盡虐待而死，差別在前者是兒童虐待打死後埋在猪舍、陳姑娘投河自殺、阿秀姑娘投湖輕生。
華人地區類似的傳說與儀式有廣東、福建、臺灣鹿港習俗，是在中秋節用菜籃為扶乩道具的籃姑、閩南習俗在中秋節用飯匙作扶乩道具的姑仔等等。學者認為這類皆是由廁神紫姑習俗所演變而來。
《戲說台灣》在2011年將椅仔姑的傳說改編拍為同名戲劇。

儀式
在台灣日治時期的台北市依舊可見到此儀式。台灣人主要是在農曆正月十五、三月初三、八月十五晚上進行。鈴木清一郎認為此等儀式有追悼亡者之含意在內，學者記載認為帶有遊戲的成份較多。
儀式稱為「迎椅仔姑」、「關椅子姑」、「關椅仔姑」等。一說閩南語的「關」，可指陰陽間的關卡，是進入陰間，人與鬼神聯絡之意；另一說，朱介凡認為「關」同於觀神的「觀」。也有人稱「關（觀）三姑」，但池田敏雄在《民俗臺灣》表示有臺灣人把兩者弄混，經他詢問過臺北萬華老婦，「關三姑」與「關椅仔姑」的儀式與用途並不同，前者是問陰間事，後者是占卜。三姑在「關三姑」是作為引導活人靈魂入地獄探望親友的角色。福建的文獻也記載「觀三姑」是種觀落陰。
連雅堂在《雅言》記載：「中秋之夕，小兒女集庭中，兩人扶一竹椅，上覆女衣一襲，裝義髻，備鏡奩、花米、刀尺之屬；焚香燒紙，口唸咒語，以迓紫姑(臺人謂之：椅仔姑)。至則其椅能動，問以吉凶則答；如聞呼嫂聲，則神忽止。或曰：紫姑，某氏女，為嫂所虐，殺而埋諸豬欄，故向是處以迓；聞呼嫂而驚走也。」
王國墦《臺北市歲時紀》紀錄台北市人會將小竹椅四足朝上，再將飯匙畫上人的眼、耳、筆、舌，簪以紅花綁在椅上，以竹篾為圈，上加紅彩，前覆空水桶，上置胭脂、水粉、香花、水果、剪刀、尺等物。小竹椅是代表該名女童。兩女子分提四個凳腳，輕輕同聲以臺灣閩南語反覆咒唱某歌謠，直到感到椅子沉重時，便是椅仔姑降臨。觀眾可問事，椅子就會以敲擊表示回答，但人們不可說到「嫂」字，不然就會離去。也有地方是需要三位少女，兩位扶椅，一位唱咒，並且傳說三位少女不是處女的話，那麼三姑的亡靈就不會來，椅子也不會搖擺，因之女性們在作此術時，也在考驗貞操。
《南洋商報》報導台灣人在上元節用一小竹椅上紮一件少女的衣服，另置以一個盛滿的水桶，以兩名少女扶椅至豬圈或廁所，燒香與紙錢，招請椅仔姑，然後回到庭院，互念某歌謠，直到椅子搖動，就可問事，但只問年歲而已。這類似山東莒县上元節習俗，也同樣到豬圈以竹椅迎紫姑。

歌謠
用來招喚椅仔姑的歌謠在臺灣各地略有不同，有些及提椅仔姑是三歲，並且描述穿著、祭品。

有些並沒提椅仔姑是三歲。

外表
關於海和尚的外型有很多種說法，最普遍的說法是認為海和尚有著巨大而類似猿猴或人形的身體、全身都是赤紅色的、背上還有四片沒有甲殼或鱗片的肉翅，遇到人就會一直笑；另外也有認為牠們是半人半魚、或是本身就是某種特殊大魚的說法。

能力
傳說中若航行的途中遇到海和尚是相當不祥的事，海和尚會給船隻招來厄運，讓它們遇上暴風雨或是翻船的災難，以前的人遇到海和尚時會燒香和紙錢驅走厄運。

相關傳說
在其他記載中，台灣海峽裡棲息著類似人形的人魚，船隻遇到人魚的話一樣會招來災禍；而日本傳說中的海坊主，也是外表類似人形和尚的巨大海怪，並且會把船隻弄翻，兩者都跟海和尚的傳說很類似。

能力
滾地魔可以變成人或狗的樣子，在地上翻滾以嚇唬經過的人車，有時還會直接往目標飛撲過去、造成恐慌，或是變成人的樣子去捉弄他人。

現身案例
1922年（大正11年），滾地魔曾在臺灣神社附近出沒過，當時牠在經過的車子正前方從人變成狗的樣子並飛撲而來，司機嚇到之餘為了閃避而造成車體破損無法繼續載客，只能請同事來將客人載走；而在他前往派出所報案時，又有個老人出現在車子擅自坐進車中，幫忙看守的人想趕走他時卻又發現老人在車裡憑空消失，嚇得逃走了。

現代研究
有人認為滾地魔是反映出當時臺灣從農業社會逐漸轉型、對現代科技文明的不安和恐懼。

徵兆
火鳥和火旗只有道士和高僧可以看見，如果屋頂發出鳥求偶的聲音或有狗無故跑到屋頂上，很有可能就是火鳥出現的徵兆，這時就需要請道士來進行鎮火儀式。

燈猴源自民間過去裝著燈油盤、以鉤子或孔固定在牆上的燈架子，以竹子製成形似靠背椅，漆成紅色並描上金色的花紋，內置一小陶盆，裝上花生油，用燈芯浸在油裏點火照明，是生活中的照明設備，因為外型很像隻蹲著的猴子而被稱為燈猴，但也有人認為是「燈鉤」的誤傳或閩南語發音類似。由於過去人們相信萬物有靈，因此燈猴也逐漸轉變為由燈架而生的靈魂或妖怪的形象，據說只要燈架放超過三年就會變成燈猴。
另有一說：舊時漳州人習慣稱油燈爲“燈猴”與“登侯”諧音，有登上侯爵之位的祝福，表達向上進取的願望。

習俗
過去的人們有在除夕或元宵節的時候燒燈猴的習俗，國史館臺灣文獻館編印的《臺灣民俗文物辭彙類編》表示這是因為竹製的燈猴容易高溫變形，造成燈油碟放不穩而發生火災，因此每年都會燒掉舊的並製作新的，據說到日治時期前台灣都還有這種習俗。。
舊時在漳州，除夕燃放鞭炮後燒燈猴，寓意喜慶和除舊迎新，舊燈猴燒後要將灰堆成12堆以卜明年各月天氣，並取燈猴灰放入家中的烘爐，家長念道：“燈猴燒成灰，厝內逐（每）項有”，意為明年將有大發展；道光年間的彰化亦有「燒舊竹燈鉤」後以同樣方式占卜明年天氣的習俗紀錄。

傳說
謊報
過去人們在冬至的時候，會在生活器具上黏上湯圓，慰勞它們在過去一年為人類的貢獻，稱為「餉耗」，但有一年，人們不小心忘記黏湯圓在燈猴上，燈猴一氣之下向玉皇大帝告狀，誣衊人類好吃懶做、浪費食物又忘恩負義，玉皇大帝也聽信燈猴的話，命令龍王在除夕的時候降下洪水，將台灣島淹沒，其他神明勸阻都無果。

迎接末日
其他器物神知道這件事後相當驚訝，連忙一方面向天庭求情、另一方面托夢通知眾人；也有說法認為是年底尾牙（過去是人們一年中最後一次祭拜土地公的祭祀活動）的時候，土地公於心不忍而通知人們末日的消息，要他們趕快做好準備，同時也請求觀世音菩薩（另有說法是灶神）幫忙向玉皇大帝求情。
得知台灣即將毀滅的人們認為逃不了，選擇坦然面對，他們先將家中供奉的神明送回天界，避免祂們被自己波及，並且在除夕當天烹煮家中所有的食物來祭祖並告別祖先，而所有在外工作的親戚也回到家裡團聚，圍成一圈吃最後一餐，吃完之後，長輩將財產分給家人，作為他們在黃泉路上的旅費，家人也不再睡覺，一起等待最後一刻。
這段過程日後也演變為台灣人過年時的各項習俗，如送走了神後，天上派遣天兵天將下來鎮守沒有神明庇佑的人們，成為日後「二四送神、二五神下降」的由來、另外還有祭拜祖先、圍爐、壓歲錢、守歲等。

新年
到了隔天早上，洪水卻沒有降下，原來是因為玉皇大帝在眾神的求情以及派遣神明下凡查看情況後，認定燈猴是在謊報而收回命令，燈猴則是受到了懲罰。
人們發現自己還活著，相當驚喜，於是先燒香、放鞭炮感謝神明庇佑，稱為「開驚」；並且出門前往寺廟祭拜、探望鄰居的平安，互道「恭喜」，也就是今日的「走春」；隔天為了確認妻子娘家的安全而回去探望親戚，成為「回娘家」的習俗；到了第四天，被事先送走的神也被請了回來，也就是「濟神」；第五天確認全島平安無事後，重新開市、恢復平常的工作，這一連串行為也成為日後過年的習俗。

後續
沉島危機結束後，人們聽說一切都是燈猴搞的鬼，為了預防牠再惹禍，每年都會將家裡的燈猴燒掉。周謝宏認為在結局記載「燒燈猴」習俗，證明其和年獸同為解釋過年習俗的「解釋性神話」。

外觀與能力
獠人族生活在台灣的深山裡，他們的身形畸形、雙手就像尖銳的三指鳥爪，擅長在樹梢間飛盪移動。

生活
獠人族住在建造在樹上的樹屋裡，大多數的時間都在樹上度過，雖然也會在地上種植穀物，但收成後也是存放在樹洞內。此外，獠人族還擅長射箭，會以弓箭攻擊入侵他們領域的任何外來者。

現代研究
從在山林生活、善於射箭、在樹上活動等特徵可以判斷，獠人族很有可能是早期漢人對台灣深山原住民混合猿猴和鳥類的妖魔化形象。

傳說
傳說中，在王得祿入葬後，墓地周遭開始發生怪事，如農作物經常被偷吃、家畜也很不安，經過調查，民眾發現是王得祿墓裡的石像晚上從墓裡跑出來所做的，其中的石翁仲（石人）甚至還會調戲婦女，村民因此把石雕破壞、並找人來破壞墓的風水。

現代研究
有人認為石像傳說很有可能是反應了嘉義當地民眾對王得祿作為當地大官並恃強凌弱的畏懼心理。

傳說
傳說中白馬幻影是由多年沒使用的金銀所孕育出來的幽靈，守護著寶藏。如果夜晚聽到馬蹄聲響，就是白馬在跑的聲音，表示寶藏可能就埋在地底，據說只有品德高超的人才有機會看到他並得知寶藏地點。
除了白馬之外，也有白兔幻影的傳說，主要流傳在澎湖，但也有在本島與白馬一起出現的傳說。白兔所保護的寶藏比白馬少，白馬大約一萬兩（約375公斤）、白兔大約一千兩（約37.5公斤）。

地點
台灣各地都有白馬幻影相關的傳說，但傳說中尋寶的人大多不是沒有找到就是找到後厄運纏身：

基隆
在和平島的聖薩爾瓦多城廢墟裡曾出現過白馬幻影，移墾者以為有寶藏而去挖掘，卻甚麼都沒有發現。

台中
一個在葫蘆墩的點心店老闆早上擦臉時在外面看到白馬幻影，連忙把毛巾丟在他背上後追上去，卻只在牠消失的地方挖到兩塊白銀，且回到家後便開始生病直到花光那兩塊白銀的錢後才康復。

屏東
在東港鎮鎮海里的鎮海宮附近有「白馬穴」的傳說。

台北市
傳說在松山有商人跟著白馬幻影在一棵松樹下找到許多金銀財寶。

澎湖
在望安鄉的四角山上出現過白兔，有三位少女遇到白兔時追上去，雖然發現寶藏，但下山的路卻坍塌了，導致她們無法下山而餓死。

傳說
有關女鬼的傳聞都是來自上面的燈塔職員，據說她會出現在職員的宿舍中，讓他們大半夜突然醒過來並目擊到她，但她不會害人。據說在日治時期時，有人不信傳聞而登島調查，但不僅沒有發現任何可能會被誤認成女鬼的東西，當晚還莫名驚醒並目擊到對方，然後女鬼隨即消失。

外表
根據採集到的證言，女鬼的外表應該是看起來年約25歲左右、盤著圓髻的美麗女性。

來歷
因為目斗嶼上沒有人居住，有人認為女鬼很有可能是遭遇船難而出現在島上、不會傷害人的陸鬼。隨著日治時期結束，女鬼的傳聞也就逐漸消失了。

傳說
因為蜈蚣的右側是太陽升起的地方，蜈蚣怕曬到腳，因此把腳繞到到另一邊，所以左邊靠彰化的腳比較多，右邊的腳比較少，因此稱作「睡地蜈蚣穴」。以前的八卦山，因大肚溪的阻擋，蜈蚣的頭是轉在彰化市這邊，所以形成蜈蚣穴。據說因為蜈蚣穴的關係，在清領時期，彰化市出來的秀才、舉人最多，文學成就最高。且因為蜈蚣的轉向，且吐了珠，這蜈蚣珠就是吐在鹿港，所以鹿港才成為最早通商港口，因此而繁華。

傳說
外表與能力
禍福鳥關於的外型有很多種說法，比較知名的說法認為禍伏鳥的大小就像鴿子、全身血紅、還只有一隻腳。另外還有白羽紅腳、或是大小像斑鳩的說法。牠們可以詛咒別人，讓被牠們盯上的人因離奇的原因死亡，如突然吐血而死、股間腫脹而死、患上重病而死等，也有光看到牠們就會死的說法。

魔鳥使
魔鳥使飼養著禍伏鳥，會驅使禍伏鳥去向自己不開心的人作祟殺害，他們眼睛是紅色的，而且除非被砍頭不然無法將他們殺死。也有說法認為魔鳥使是被泰雅族的惡魔「亞凱·惡多伏（Ya kai·ot to fu/Yaqih na utux）」所唆使或洗腦才會成為魔鳥使，而禍伏鳥本身就是惡魔在他們身邊的化身，會咒死魔鳥使所討厭和喜歡的人。
有時就算不是魔鳥使，也會有人飼養著祖先流傳下來的禍伏鳥，並且為此相當痛苦，直到把禍伏鳥殺死為止。

習俗
泰雅族人相當恐懼並痛恨禍伏鳥和魔鳥使，因此若被族人認為是魔鳥使的人或家族，輕則被部落的人疏遠、重則被屠殺全家，有點類似歐洲中世紀的女巫審判，對族人而言，那些人已經是在社會規範和組織（gaga）之外的人。
另外，據說有小孩在經過其他部落時因為被魔鳥使稱讚漂亮而被禍伏鳥詛咒而死，所以當某個部落傳出有魔鳥使時，其他部落的人會繞道而行。

其他
禍伏鳥的泰雅語發音：Huni，本身就有巫術或詛咒的意思，而魔鳥使的發音：Mahuni則是使用巫術的人，也就是黑巫師的意思。

沿革
此祠座落於大湖公園一角，興建年代不可考 。外面柱子上有「青山碧玉源源進、麗水黃金滾滾來」對聯。裡面門邊外有「長者里民敬、老公眾共欽」對聯，中聯「考古留存跡」。
祠內無神像，只供著一座神位。2001年納莉颱風時，老公祠上面兩顆大石頭沖下來，卻沒有損壞該祠，有居民認為相當玄妙。
2004年3月12日，台北市文化局會同內湖文史工作室負責人陳金讚、文化大學大建築系教授李乾朗、淡江大學歷史系教授周宗賢及專家學者會勘，認為該地水閘見證內湖水利與產業發展史，可望登錄為臺北市文化資產，而且周邊的老榕、福佑宮、老公祠，都與水圳開闢有關，可思考一併納作整體景觀加以活化。

傳說
據文史工作室陳金讚在2003年表示，地方耆老相傳在台灣清治時期時十四份埤（今大湖公園）興建十四份圳土堤時經常崩塌損壞，工事不遂，一再拖延。遂有人建議用活靈祭（俗稱人柱）祈求工程早日竣工。於是主事者即採納此意見，派人至艋舺乞丐寮購買一位老乞丐，帶回後，先錦衣玉食善待了數日，然後將他活埋，獻給本座堤防。當地居民為了追念這位犧牲的乞丐，遂合力出錢蓋廟奉祀，並取名「老公祠」。
2017年1月開始到7月初，東森新聞網統計，大湖公園發生至少七起女性落水的事件，有兩位輕生死亡、 一人搶救保住一命，另有四位意外落水，讓這項傳聞再度引起討論。如該年2月18日凌晨民眾發現一位約六旬的女性浮屍；3月22日上午一名年約五旬婦女疑溺水，救起時已無呼吸心跳，送往內湖三總急救；7月4日早有一名約五十五歲的女子溺水，命危送醫等。
一位自稱有通靈體質的民俗工作者高薛琳姬在《中天新聞》說，老乞丐的魂魄已不在祠堂內，是別的亡魂住在這，並批評老公祠擺設插著桃紅色的花會讓男鬼想要娶妻，建議讓老公祠保持乾淨，較不易招致禍端。當地秀湖里里長謝明毅聽過此活人獻祭的傳說。他也表達會以科學方式處理，已於當地增設救生圈與竹竿，未來希望在湖邊增設警語。也有在民眾說自己在這已住二十年，沒有聽過這種事。戲說台灣曾改編老公祠的故事，拍作單元劇《乞食老公祠》。

身世
莎娃出生在太巴塱部落的卡基塔安（Kakita'an）家族，有一個哥哥阿杆（Agah/Angahalimolo），他們的家族傳說是女神迪雅瑪贊的後代。

傳說
被擄
莎娃從小就因為自己的美貌而聲名遠播，連卑南族也被她所吸引，於是在她六歲的時候，趁著母親下田工作時以法術把她擄走，得知的家人雖然心裡著急，但當時卑南族的軍隊相當強悍，幾乎沒辦法救回她，家人們都相當絕望，然而，她的哥哥阿杆不願放棄，開始勤練戰鬥技巧和撐竿跳，發誓要把妹妹帶回來，幾年後，他成為了太巴塱部落第一的勇士。

重逢
武功練成的阿杆接著離開部落往南，族自尋找莎娃的下落，過程中他途經拉拉鄂斯族的部落，他在當地的好友馬亞威（Mayawei）表示願意和他一起去救莎娃，馬亞威因為從小就和卑南族相鄰，不僅相當了解他們的習慣、還通卑南語，兩人先喬裝成卑南族進入卑南族的部落，在路上找到莎娃，兄妹相認之後開始計畫逃亡。他們最後決定在卑南族的猴祭那天趁著部落狂歡並放鬆戒備時下手，以撐竿跳的方式越過部落外圍的刺竹林離開，為此他們選擇一條沿途上都有竹子的撤退路線、並將竹子拉彎、用繩索固定成弓形，做成一個彈射裝置。

營救
到了猴祭當天，卑南族人大肆慶祝，而莎娃也趁機多給卑南族青年倒酒，讓他們失去戰鬥能力，到了祭典最高潮時，馬亞威喬裝成卑南族神話中認為能帶來好運的紅衣神來到現場，讓卑南族人把注意力集中在他身上，這時躲在旁邊草叢裡的阿杆趁機抓著廣場外彈射裝置的頂端，並割斷固定的繩索，將自己彈入廣場的人群中抓住莎娃，又利用竹子回彈的時候翻出廣場和刺竹林，並用一樣的方法飛盪到卑南族勢力外和馬亞威會合，一行人抄小徑離開，終於救回了莎娃。（在部分版本中，阿杆是趁著莎娃在盪鞦韆時撐竿跳進去、從空中抱住莎娃之後再用撐竿跳逃離現場的。）

後續
回到家的莎娃雖然結婚生子，但因為身上被卑南族施了咒術，仍然生病而死；而發現真相的卑南族人立刻採取報復，進攻拉拉鄂斯族和太巴塱部落，雖然阿美族人在激戰後獲勝，但也造成了相當大的損傷，包括馬亞威在內的拉拉鄂斯族的青年全數戰死，而過程中奇美部落也和太巴塱部落聯手打敗卑南族軍隊，建立起兩社的合作關係，阿美族和拉拉鄂斯族也自此和卑南族成為世仇。

文化資產
現今位於太巴塱部落的富田納骨碑，據說就是莎娃的衣冠塚，而該石碑目前已被花蓮縣政府訂為文化資產。

身世與形象
莫古魯是過去阿里山上數個部落中一個部落的酋長獨生子，為人殘忍凶暴，經常到處打獵、侵犯或殺害其他部落的族人，因此被稱為「阿里山之熊」。

傳說
遭遇反抗
當時，阿里山另一個部落酋長有一對漂亮的女兒：阿娃娜、阿娃嘉，她們有一次帶著一群女孩在森林東側唱歌跳舞時，被外出打獵的莫古魯發現，莫古魯上前去欺負她們，大多數的女孩都逃走了，只有姊妹倆豪不畏懼得請他離開，還在莫古魯想要侵犯她們時狠狠打他，最後領著女孩們離開。

恐嚇
丟臉的莫古魯心有不甘，便派人到姊妹的部落，謊稱山神生氣，要獻祭100個人頭，並向他們要求其中50個，如果不從，部落就會被燒光並屠殺殆盡。部落的人都十分恐慌，姐妹倆知道這是莫古魯的主意，便到森林中的空地上下跪向天神祈禱，表明願意犧牲自己拯救部落。天神被她們所感動，便將她們留下的淚水化作湖泊，而她們也淹沒其中。

懲罰
後來，莫古魯率領部落中的壯漢進攻姊妹倆的部落時，被那座湖擋住去路，而姐妹倆的身影漂在水面上，大罵他假冒山神的名義做盡壞事，揚言天神會懲罰他，生氣的莫古魯命令部下們游湖過去，但他們才剛進入水中，天空就開始下起了暴雨、天打雷劈、湖面甚至湧起巨浪，把入侵者沖散，莫古魯的軍隊因此解體，姊妹倆的部落也因此得救，姊妹倆本人則消失於湖泊之中。

後續
為了感謝阿娃娜、阿娃嘉犧牲自己拯救部落，部落的族人稱呼她們的眼淚形成的湖泊為「姊妹潭」，而受到懲罰的莫古魯則深深感到自己的錯誤，就此改邪歸正。

其他版本
另有傳說認為姊妹潭的名字由來是因為阿娃娜、阿娃嘉同時愛上一名男子，卻不願傷害姊妹情，於是雙雙投潭自盡。

虎姑婆最常聽到的故事版本：
老虎精在修行，必須吃幾個小孩才能完全變成人，所以下山找小孩吃。下山後，牠躲在一戶人家門外偷聽，知道媽媽要外出，屋子裡只有一對姐弟，於是就變成姑婆的模樣騙小孩開門進到屋子裡去。睡到半夜，虎姑婆吃了弟弟，發出咀嚼的聲音，姐姐聽到後問虎姑婆在吃什麼，虎姑婆說在吃花生，接著丟一塊弟弟的手指頭給姐姐，姐姐鎮定的假裝要上廁所，然後躲到門外的樹上，等到虎姑婆發現要吃她時，她機智的要求虎姑婆燒一鍋熱水（另一說是熱油）給她，並要求虎姑婆將熱水吊到樹上給她，她要自己跳到鍋裡，當虎姑婆把熱水用繩子吊到樹上時，姐姐叫虎姑婆閉上眼睛，張開嘴巴，然後把熱水淋在虎姑婆喉嚨裡，虎姑婆便因此喪命了。
但隨著地區不同各地也有不同版本的故事，故事也因此有不同的開頭與結局。諸如某些版本中屋裡的小孩是一對姊妹而非姐弟，而收服虎精的過程則是神仙化身為老鼠指點兩姊妹如何逃出虎口，最後用符收服老虎精。另外也有版本為熱油燙傷老虎精後，姊妹再用棍棒打死老虎。

評論
類似的故事情節從虎外婆變異為狼外婆的型式流傳於中國各地，早期的學者將它稱為「老虎外婆型」，如前述〈虎媼傳〉 。韓國、日本、越南等地也有類似情節的故事流傳，與歐洲小紅帽的故事相似。是屬於狼與七隻小羊和小紅帽的複合型。此外，類似這樣的以兩個孩子與意圖謀害他們的成人的情節演繹的故事，同樣地在《格林童話》尚有〈韓賽爾與格麗特〉(Hänsel und Gretel；即糖果屋)，在韓國則有〈薔花紅蓮傳〉的民間故事，這類故事的目的可能旨在警示孩子，不要隨便相信說是孩子的親人或藉機想進家門的陌生人，甚至開門讓他進到家裡來。

不同版本
由《虎媼傳》可知，中國安徽流傳的虎外婆故事，孩子是被挑擔人從樹上救走，而老母虎是被老虎同伴殺死的。
中國西南地區流傳的則是以黑熊爲主角的“熊家婆”（家婆即外婆）故事，情節大體相同。

現代通俗文化中的虎姑婆
在過去的幾十年中，虎姑婆的故事一直在臺灣的表演藝術中不斷出現，較知名的包括有：丘丘合唱團的歌曲、臺灣公共電視臺所製播的黏土動畫，以及以驚悚手法所拍攝的電影。

歌曲
虎姑婆的同名歌曲「虎姑婆」，收錄在1983年丘丘合唱團的「丘丘合唱團 II-陌生的人」專輯中。

黏土動畫
臺灣公共電視臺和英國威爾斯電視臺曾合作製作虎姑婆的黏土動畫，並在2000年10月22日獲得第17屆芝加哥國際兒童影展（the 17th Chicago International Children's Film Festival）的電視類最佳動畫片獎。

電影
在2005年時，臺灣導演王毓雅曾以驚悚方式重新編劇拍攝虎姑婆（Aunt Tigress）的電影。

童書
虎姑婆的童書在臺灣以不同型式廣泛流傳。在2007年時，臺灣插畫家王家珠（Eva Wang）所繪製的虎姑婆繪本入選義大利波隆那世界兒童插畫展，並賣出美國、印尼、俄羅斯……多國版權。

傳說內容
蛇郎君有很多種不同版本，內容大致上分以下成四個部分：

某戶人家的父親得罪了巨蛇，為了活命只好答應把一個女兒嫁給牠，而家中的女兒卻幾乎都拒絕，只有孝順的老么為了父親而選擇答應這門親事，並且嫁給了巨蛇。
老么在嫁給巨蛇後，深受巨蛇疼愛，並且跟相當富裕的巨蛇過著優渥的生活，其中一個姊姊知道後，為了獨佔這樣的生活而趁著巨蛇不在時殺了妹妹，並且扮成她的樣子
姊妹鬥爭，死掉的妹妹的靈魂幻化成鳥警告蛇郎君，但被姐姐殺死、又變成樹，也被砍倒並做成家具，但那些家具又屢屢妨礙姐姐，使她最後將其劈成柴燒掉
妹妹藉由附在被拿去燒時在做的年糕、紅龜粿等東西並被放在棉被中，最後終於復活、事情曝光，蛇郎君殺了姐姐，夫妻繼續幸福地生活下去。

其他版本
蛇郎君的故事在台灣各地有很多版本，劇情雖然大致雷同，但仍有許多細節會有差異，如姊妹的父親職業就有撿豬屎、花農、員外、獵人、樵夫、頭目等、女兒人數也從兩個到五個不等、殺死妹妹的人是大姊或二姊、長的醜的姊姊以各種理由欺騙蛇郎君（如吃太多黃豆聲音變啞、炸豬油時不小心燙到臉而變醜等），有些版本中蛇郎君還會顧及妻子的感受而變成帥氣的男子，而因為細節不同，也有很多不同的結局，例如最後妹妹沒有復活、或是變成的鳥被姐姐趕走等。

排灣族版本
有一名父親摘了一朵小黃花送給女兒，但那朵花其實是條蛇，蛇威脅女兒如果不嫁給她的話就要咬死父親，女兒答應了，幾天後蛇帶著四個朋友變成人出現，原來他們都是天上的神蛇。婚後女兒告訴神蛇因為她嫁給蛇而被族人嘲笑，神蛇便再也沒有現出原形。

魯凱族版本
現代研究
蛇郎君的故事很有可能是由中國移民帶來台灣、並且隨著跟原住民本身的蛇神傳說交流而有所變化，分類上屬於AT分類法中的「神奇的丈夫」（425～449）的故事類型。在不同的故事版本中，往往會加入當地族群的文化、觀念及思想的元素在其中，如漢人的版本中，就比較注重女兒的「孝道」以及蛇郎君的富有，但原住民的版本中，卻比較注重蛇郎君本身的祖靈、神靈的身分，以彰顯氏族、貴族的權能。

外表與能力
蛇首族有著蛇頭人身，會像蛇那樣吐信，背上還有翅膀能夠飛行，喜歡吃人，但是討厭雄黃。

傳說
傳說在清朝年間，曾有要前往日本的艦隊在雞籠山附近修整，將領萬正色派出四名士兵查看附近環境，士兵卻遇上蛇首族，一人被吃，其他三人藉由雄黃驅散蛇首族後成功逃離。

現代研究
因為傳說中的將領萬正色曾打敗鄭氏軍隊，且其記載內容說蛇首族是「當地住民」，因此蛇首族很有可能是清代對台灣原住民的妖魔化形象，而該傳說是改編自1722年（康熙61年）5月的船難，當時漳州把總朱文炳帶著士兵出海前往鹿耳門，但因風浪飄到了蛤仔難，被當地原住民以為是侵略者而發生衝突，後來藉由交易平息紛爭，並且在當地原住民的款待與幫助下搭乘獨木舟沿著雞籠山、金包裏離開。

來源與外表
據說將貓的屍體埋入土中的話，貓屍就會吸收雨水和陽光的精華，變成貓鬼從土裡出來害人。貓鬼的體型比普通的貓還要大，有著兩尺到三尺（60到90公分）的金色長毛，毛還會微微發出毫光。

習性
貓鬼白天躲在茂密的大樹上，晚上才出來活動。牠們喜歡麻油雞的味道，經常潛入有剛出生嬰兒的人家中殺死嬰兒，特別是嬰兒生下的三朝、七朝、十三朝和滿月時最容易出現。
另一方面，據說將貓鬼的毛放在家裡，就可以防止其他貓鬼的侵擾。曾經有人家為了保護家裡的新生兒，刻意用麻油雞的味道吸引貓鬼進來家裡，趁著牠在吃麻油雞時攻擊牠，雖然被貓鬼逃掉，但其留下的一搓毛讓其他貓鬼不敢接近，保護了全村的嬰兒。

民間習俗
因為貓鬼的傳說，臺灣社會中流傳著「死貓吊樹頭」的習俗，將死去的貓屍掛在樹上，讓它乾燥，魂魄散去，才不會變成貓鬼害人，這項習俗現今在部分地區仍然存在。另外，也有人會先把剛出生的嬰兒送走，直到滿月才接回家，或者乾脆不辦嬰兒的三、七、十三朝禮。

其他傳說
除了把貓屍掛在樹上外，民間也有把狗屍放在水中的習俗，有說法認為這是因為傳說中如果把狗埋在土裡，狗屍會吸取地氣，變成狗妖向人作祟；另有說法認為狗的前世是作惡的人，被懲罰投胎為狗，如果把狗屍埋入土中，屍體完整，來世又得投胎當狗，所以要丟進水裡使其潰爛。

現代研究
除了傳統民間傳說之外，現在另有人認為，「死貓吊樹頭、死狗放水流」的習俗，其實是當初來台開墾的漢人為了強佔平埔族的土地，故意把貓屍、狗屍在其土地上隨意亂丟、造成環境髒亂，讓平埔族放棄土地而逐漸養成的習俗。

外觀與能力
赤虯是一種長著角的蛟龍，一身赤紅就像有火在燒。牠掌管風雲雨露，能夠興風作浪、降下暴雨，喜歡穿梭在雲層之間。

現身案例
據說赤虯曾在1854年（咸豐四年）時乘著黑雲出現在台灣中南部，引發猛烈的暴風雨，造成濁水溪河水暴漲，沿岸被洪水淹沒。

現代研究與相關傳說

傳說
據說撒奇萊雅族的祖先在奇萊平原上定居後，逐漸變得懶惰、自私、還對天神不敬，被激怒的天神因此降下大洪水淹沒部落，倖存的族人只能逃到砂婆礑山（Sabato'）上避難，雖然族人誠心對天神道歉懺悔，但仍然沒有得到原諒，祭司表示需要用族人中最好的男女獻祭才會停止洪水，然而，雖然族人找到志願成為供品的人，但好幾次都被洪水沖回來（表示不接受），祭司又做了一次占卜後才表示天神指定要獻祭達娃，雖然族人因為達娃平常的好人緣而相當猶豫，但為了平息洪水，她自願走上用大米篩做的獻祭用小船，和為了陪伴她而自願成為祭品的少年納姆赫（Namuh）一起沒入水中，洪水才終於消退。

後續
洪水退去後，砂婆礑山的山壁上出現一塊長寬各數十公尺、光亮潔白的三角形大理石印記，族人稱之為「神的印記」（sipiledacay），據說那是天神為達娃和納姆赫的犧牲奉獻所感動而特別打造出來、讓撒奇萊雅族人可以永遠記得他們的犧牲、並且警惕自己勤奮工作。

文化

在撒奇萊雅族的火神祭中，達娃是其中一位迎請而來的祭祀對象，被族人稱作「聖女」。

傳說
原因
據說過去有一個紅頭部落的孕婦，為了找餐具和找東西吃而前往海邊，觸犯禁忌翻開了珊瑚，憤怒的天神因此掀起了海嘯淹沒達悟族人的部落，但也有說法認為孕婦只是去海邊提水或散步，並發現海水一直往後退，正覺得奇怪時就看到海嘯襲來，或是洪水是來自於孕婦翻開珊瑚後，海水從下面的洞裡湧出來所導致。

洪水期間
在海嘯和洪水的侵襲下，倖存的族人逃到Jipeygangen（現稱青蛇山）山上（一說Dsipiganin和Dsitsakalman山、或大森山Di-kamioron和紅頭山Di-karurinam），因為動物幾乎都被淹死，陷入缺乏糧食的危機，只能摘一種野草（Paputok）沾鹽巴吃，最初幾年人口甚至降到十人以下，有一對姊妹（或兄妹）只能互相找頭蝨吃，結果姊姊（哥哥）因為把食物讓給妹妹吃而餓死。洪水持續了好幾年，到了第八年的時候，森林裡甚至出現了貝類。

水退
到了第九年的時候，有人（一說引發洪水的孕婦）抓到一隻老鼠，她將老鼠的尾巴拔斷，並誠心請求讓海水退到鼠尾巴所落到的地方，最後丟出去，洪水才逐漸開始退，到了第十年，族人終於得以下山，孕婦也才在這個時候生下孩子。

後續
洪水退去後，糧食危機依然存在，族人依然只能摘草吃，直到有人找到了水芋，並且發現它們在積水的田裡可以長得很好，族人才終於得以吃飽，芋頭也因此成為達悟族傳統中最重要的主食之一，洪水退去後第一年後族人開發出青芋田；二、三年後開始有竹長出來；十四年後岩岸露出，山上出現樹木。

其他版本
另有其他版本的洪水傳說跟上述傳說在許多方面都有所不同：

原因
有版本認為洪水的起因是因為族人在蘭嶼繁衍後，開始不再敬神而引起神的憤怒、或是族群之間互相征伐所致，朗島部落中也有說法是島上的人心術不正、沒有倫理觀念、或是朗島舊部落（Jimawawa）的人經常仗勢欺人而被天神懲罰。

後續
在洪水退去之後，有些版本認為原本的人類全部都死了，而天神看到蘭嶼島上災後重生、一片生機蓬勃的樣子，便丟下一顆石頭，從中生出達悟族的石生人祖先，而新長出的竹子裡又出現了達悟族的竹生人祖先，人類因此繼續在島上繁衍，但也有說法認為他們兩個就是最後倖存的兩個人、或洪水是在他們出現之後才發生的、也有當時只有蘭嶼北部有住人，南部沒有，所以天神把兩人送到南部繁衍的說法。

內容
過去天空上有兩個太陽一起照耀，因此大地相當炎熱，達悟族人不需要用火烤熟食物，只要把食物放在地上就可以。
有一天，一對夫婦（一說一個母親）帶著孩子到山裡採集食物，雖然他們事先將孩子放在遮陽的棚子下，但孩子仍然被太陽曬死了，父母們又哀痛又憤怒，指著其中一個太陽，大聲詛咒他，那個太陽便逐漸失去熱能和亮度（一說已經死了），變成了月亮。

其他版本
另有版本的傳說認為變成月亮的太陽是真的受到族人的攻擊而被刺死；或是原本不僅有兩個太陽，天也很低，直到一個太陽變成月亮後才由西卡如論將天舉高，但也有說法認為是先將天舉高，才出現了兩個太陽。

簡述
達悟督拉納拉橫的意思為「被仰望的人」，她們住在天上，是天神的後代，星辰出現的地方也是她們居住的地方，據說她們每個都相當漂亮、皮膚白皙、還全身發光，當她們下凡時，會順著天神立起的竹梯下來，並且也藉由竹梯把人間的小米送到天上，由於在部分部落（如紅頭部落）中，人類的祖先是被送下來的達悟督拉納拉橫，因此也有族人會說女性是從星星過來、並且在死後靈魂會變成仙女回到天上。

仙女傳說
達悟族的部分的部落中，有因為天神憐憫地上受苦的族人，而派達悟督拉納拉橫下凡跟他們結婚的傳說，有許多種版本，大致發展的劇情為：

從前，有兩兄弟生活得很辛苦，天神因為可憐他們的生活，派一個或兩個達悟督拉納拉橫下凡跟他們結婚。
婚後的夫妻在妻子的安排下過得很幸福，因為妻子總是會從倉庫裡拿出準備好的食物，男人就算沒有捕魚或打獵也沒關係。
雖然妻子叮嚀丈夫不可以去看倉庫，但丈夫受不了好奇還是去偷看了，並且嚇跑了在裡面製造食物的僕人。
妻子發現後對丈夫的不守信用很生氣，回到了天上。

傳說
據說過去的遠古時代，天空上只有一個大太陽，由於太陽太大了，大地的萬物都被烤死，因此一個邵族英雄就在農曆三月十一日那天，用弓箭把太陽射成兩半，比較大的一半變成太陽，以緩和許多的陽光照耀白天、比較小的一半變成月亮，照亮黑夜，邵族因此開始將祂們視為神祭拜。

內容
過去天空很低，而且月亮的光熱還比太陽更強，祂們輪番升上天空，炎熱的天氣和日夜不分的日子不僅讓鄒族人生活很痛苦，也難以交合，族群的生存陷入困境。這時，一位巫師（yoifo）認為這樣他們遲早會滅族，所以決定將月亮殺死。
他帶著弓箭，射中月亮的肚子，月亮的血滴到地上，把一部分山上的石頭染成紅色，而祂的光熱也頓時減少了許多。被射中的月亮和太陽一起躲起來，讓大地好一段時間沒有照明，人們只能升火，到最後樹木都被砍完了，就連家屋也拆來燒，讓大家都相當煩惱。直到有一天，太陽終於開始從東邊升起，雖然很快又躲回東方的地平線下，但隨著時間流逝，祂和月亮逐漸拉長現身的時間，最後終於恢復原本的日夜，而月亮也因為被射傷，一個月中只有一小段時間能展現祂原本的樣貌（滿月）。從此之後，族人的生活就舒適多了。

傳說
被殺
傳說在鄭成功率領軍隊擊敗佔據基隆的荷蘭東印度公司殘餘勢力後，在金山的國聖埔海岸進行修整，並且暗中派人把十三億元的軍費分成十三處埋在當地十三個不為人知的地方，還為了保住秘密、把協助進行掩埋的人都殺了，而他的女兒鄭女因為厭惡軍旅生活，也一起殺了，並且跟某處軍費埋在一起，給她立了一個上頭有「鄭女碑」字樣的墓碑。

化靈
後來某一天，當地附近的農夫在種田時，突然有位年輕貌美的女性出現請他替自己修房子，農夫因為忙著處理田地的事情而沒有答應，到了隔天的同一時間，女子再度出現並向他要求同一件事，農夫這次答應了，然而，在農夫跟著女子前往她口中的房屋時，女子的身影突然憑空消失，農夫嚇了一跳、連忙四處找尋他的身影，並在附近的窪地發現堆積如山的金銀，他取走了其中兩三個、並且用茅草掩蓋起來準備明天再來搬，可是第二天回到現場時，卻已經什麼也沒有了。當地人相信那個女子就是鄭女的幽靈。

現代研究
有人認為鄭女傳說中鄭成功的殘暴形象有可能是在鄭成功的英雄形象在因政治因素而被塑造出來之前的民間傳說、或是清朝官方為了醜化鄭氏政權的宣傳。

傳說
在風水學中，當地為一個「鯪鯉穴」，傳說金穿山甲過去在漢人進入犁頭店當地時，潛入了地底中，當牠在土中鑽動或鑽出地面時，也是在幫助農夫翻土，讓當年的作物可以成長茁壯，而村莊也不會發生災難，並出現許多優秀的人才。
也有說法中穿山甲並非金色，而是普通的穿山甲。

民俗
由於金穿山甲到了冬天會冬眠，如果牠沒能在夏天前醒來的話，村莊就會面臨災難，因此當地居民會在端午節時敲打鍋盆製造聲響來吵醒地底的金穿山甲的習慣。原先這只有從小規模的賽跑活動，而到了1980年代擴大舉辦，並加入木屐競走的比賽，用力跺地製造聲響，俗稱「穿木屐、躦鯪鯉」。

現代研究
「躦鯪鯉」的競走活動最早並非來自漢人，而是當地平埔族的成年禮「走標」，後來才因為被漢人融入、並與風水信仰中的「鯪鯉穴」結合，成為今日的金穿山甲傳說。

文獻記載
最早有關金魅的記載出自《民俗台灣》中宮山智淵介紹的〈金魅〉。傳說金魅原是一名叫做金綢的婢女，生前在某富翁家工作，性勤勞愛潔，卻被嚴厲殘酷的女主人虐打致死。金綢死後，女主人將其屍體草草埋葬，很快就開始物色新的婢女。奇怪的是，家裡明明已經沒有人打掃，卻一直維持著整潔。無論地板、家具、碗瓢都一塵不染，彷彿每晚都被精心擦拭過一般。一個月後，新的婢女入住富翁家，夜晚就睡在金綢的房間裡。隔天早上，卻不見其蹤影，只留下一段頭髮與耳環。女主人驚訝不已，認定這一切都是死後化為厲鬼的金綢所為，於是焚香祭拜金綢並為其立牌位，希望以一年一次活祭品為代價，請金綢繼續為家裡工作，不要作祟家人。從此以後，富翁家每年都會以賤價買入殘廢的奴婢，使其住進金綢的房間，隔天該奴婢消失，只剩頭髮；而金綢也履行約定，使富翁家永保整潔。此事留傳開後，不少民眾爭相仿效立牌祭拜。金綢之名也因其身為鬼魅的特質而改為「金魅」。最早開始祭祀金魅的職業以飯店業為主，希望店面永保整潔；之後一般農家也跟進，使金魅從事插秧、除草、收割等工作。
相傳金魅學習能力很強，只要在田裡插一株秧做為示範，隔天金魅就會依示範完成所有工作。然而金魅也有不知變通的缺點：如果有人惡作劇將做為示範的秧苗反插，隔天金魅也會將整片田的秧苗都倒插。
祭祀金魅的代價是活祭品，祭祀者須定期哄騙外人到家裡過夜；或是用糖果等食物碰觸祭拜金魅使用過的餐具，使其沾上金魅的唾液。吃下沾有金魅唾液的人會被吸乾精氣，臉色蠟黃，骨瘦如柴的死去。作客時，若懷疑對方家有祭祀金魅，可試著在地板上吐口水。若口水瞬間消失，或房內過度整潔，及代表該家主有祭祀金魅。若要防範金魅吸取精氣，可在吃飯時將食物靠近頭髮做摩擦樣；或在胯下處晃幾下再吃。由於金魅有潔癖，會逃避汙穢。
祭祀金魅被視為非常不道德的事。傳說祭祀過金魅的家族將難逃斷子絕孫的命運，因此在台灣並未普及。直至日治時期，祭祀金魅的習俗已幾乎消失，只有少數耆老還聽過金魅的傳說。

形貌
金魅由於是靈魂所化，故沒有明確的形體。但也有少數目擊案例，稱其形貌似蛇。

源流
金魅的「魅」字在日文記載中寫作「鬼采」，讀音為キンツアイ，可知其最早應讀做「ㄘㄞˇ」，但該字並不存在於中文中，故在翻譯時寫成「魅」。
1965年，林本元在《台灣風物》發表〈金蠶〉一文，提到金蠶盛行於台灣中北部，與金魅一樣會為人工作、「倒插秧」；此外，在苗栗瓜鬼坑一帶也有會為人工作、「倒插秧」的妖怪「瓜鬼」。在客家傳說中，「瓜鬼」又稱「家鬼」，屬於「金蠶蠱毒」的一種。
是此，「金魅」、「金蠶」、「瓜鬼」、「家鬼」被認為是同一系統的傳說，其源起與「人死後為加害者工作」的母題，可能來自原始部落社會的巫蠱信仰：被蠱毒害死的人，魂魄不得超生，反而會化為倀鬼，受下蠱者驅使。

傳說
傳說中阿巴里是達邦社的一名頭目，生活在18世紀中期（1750年代），由於他勇敢而擅長打獵，每次帶族人進入山中狩獵時都可以有大量收穫，族人視他為英雄，漢人因此稱此地為阿巴里或阿巴邑山，最後直稱阿里山。

阿巴里的史料
史料中有關「阿巴里」的記載，1719年吳鳳與「阿里山土官阿猫里」（台語猫音ba，與va不同）簽訂贌租契約，贌租原屬鄒族伊母祝群（imucu）盧麻產社（romasana或yovcana）所有的番仔潭（今竹崎鄉灣橋附近，轉音稱鹿滿村），1788年以後，同音的「阿吧里」亦幾次出現在贌租契約上（應為不同一人）；:138-1431788年與1790年「阿里山總社」「番頭目阿吧哩」等人因協助平定林爽文事件被兩次安排前往北京為乾隆商壽；久美部落Luhtu社群（鹿楮社）族人流傳 Avai 頭目兩度渡海出征，從敵人Hongte（疑為皇帝）拯救兄弟的傳說，而現今久美部落故頭目的夫人仍保存據稱當時乾隆所賞賜的「龍袍」。:6-10另外，1886年，嘉義前山大南勢上下八社社長「阿巴里」等一千七百餘人歸化，但無法確定這些社群是否和鄒族有關。而在這些記載之前皆早有「阿里山」一名。

阿里山名稱的史料
現代流傳阿里山一名來自鄒族頭目之名「阿里」的說法，最早始於1967年出版的《嘉義縣志》，引述自當時在戰後來台的吳鳳鄉阿里山林場技師柳竹青的說法，後來又出現了另一個頭目「阿巴里」的說法。

反駁
研究者研究阿巴里與阿里山之名的傳說，認為這項傳說與現存文獻史料並不吻合，2003年生態學者陳玉峰教授撰文斥責此說為「漢人創造想像的神話」：

荷蘭文獻中與阿里山音近的記載最早出現在1630年代，1636年尤羅伯在寫給阿姆斯特丹評議會的書信中，記述了離新港北方兩天路程，哆囉嘓（今台南白河、東山一帶）以北，有稱為Jarissang的村落（記錄在Dalivo、Dovoha等村落之間，漢譯他里霧、打猫，今雲林斗南、嘉義民雄）；:2511647年的鄒族村落戶口表及包稅統計表中有Arrissangh社群的記錄，:124-126另有Arrissangh、Arisangh、Arissangh、Arissang等不同拼法的記載，在現今阿里山外面的平地或淺山標示Arisangh，《熱蘭遮城日記》第二冊記載「阿里山又名『斗六東』」，原文為「Arissangh ofte Talackbaÿen」、「Arissang of Talacbaÿen」。以上荷蘭文獻原始史料中「阿里山」的名稱中有山，但指的是平地或淺山，並不是指內山，「阿里山」此詞的三字俱為音譯，並不是名叫「阿里」的山。荷蘭文獻也有記載鄰近的諸羅山，也位在平地，其山字也是音譯。:116-121
漢字文獻在1680年代即已出現阿里山，清國攻克鄭氏之後，在台灣置府的1684年，《福建通志》〈台灣府三縣圖〉在諸羅縣治右上（東南）方的平地處標示「啞里山」；次年1685年起始編撰的《台灣府志》，在〈坊里〉、〈敘山·諸羅縣山〉等章節有「阿里山社」、「阿里山八社」的記載；1694年《台灣府志》高志增修〈台灣府總圖〉在諸羅縣治右上方的平地處標示「阿里山」；:44-45推定為1699–1704年調製的《康熙台灣輿圖》，國立台灣博物館藏網站的〈古今地圖對照〉有標示「啞里社」在今阿里山鄉（此輿圖在後壠社東側另有標示「啞里山社」，疑與今阿里山無關）；推定1697–1722年調製的《艾渾、羅刹、台灣、蒙古軍備圖》，在台灣的圖幅中，諸羅縣治右（南）方的平地處標示「呵里山」；而1716年啟撰的《諸羅縣志》所附地圖「阿里山」標示在玉山西南側、諸羅縣治東南側的淺山。以上荷文與漢文史料皆跟傳說中阿巴里的年代對不上。
相關史料中有關「阿巴里」的記載，有1719年「阿里山土官阿猫里」簽訂的贌租契約；:138-143有1788年與1790年「阿里山總社」「番頭目阿吧哩」等人因協助平定林爽文事件被兩次安排前往北京為乾隆商壽；:6-10這些記載都不是達邦社。另有1886年受官方招降的原住民族頭目之一。
過去阿里山並非達邦社的獵場，而是特富野社，且各自的獵場有明顯區分。雖達邦社在十九世紀以後的文獻記載勢力強盛，然已有阿里山一名存在的荷蘭文獻中記錄的達邦社，當時勢力並不強盛。:123而實際租約中的阿猫里是伊姆祝群，流傳 Avai 頭目兩次渡海出征的傳說是在 Luhtu 社群（鹿楮社）。
世代贌租阿里山一帶入墾的漢人後代並沒聽過這則傳說，也沒有方法可以解釋清治的「阿巴里」如何轉變為早在荷治時即存在的「阿里山」一名的原因。
族人並不稱此地為阿里山。
另外，過去所指稱的「阿里山」並不是山，跟現在的阿里山區位置不同，而是靠近平地的淺山區。綜上所述，將阿巴里的傳說連結到阿里山的命名，很有可能只是不明白鄒族文化的漢人道聽塗說而記載下來的。

其他說法
關於阿里山名字的來源，另有說法認為是日治時期時，阿里山屬於一個名叫「A-buy」的高氏族人（即白色恐怖受難者高一生的先祖）獵場，並且被日本人口誤說成「阿巴里」，阿里山也就被稱為「阿巴里的山」，但這個說法同樣有阿巴里傳說與現存史料文獻不吻合的問題。
阿里山名字來源，目前主要的說法來自日治時1938年出版的《台灣地名研究》，安倍明義記述阿里山來源已不可考，但自行猜測「阿里」可能為清初台灣府城南側、鳳山以南東側內山族群的通稱「傀儡」，為當地平埔族（馬卡道族）稱呼山上的原住民為「Kali」台語音譯Kale的K音脫落，變成阿里山的名字，但許多學者都不同意此猜測。2011年鄒族學者Pasuya Poiconu（考試委員巴蘇亞·博伊哲努教授，漢名浦忠成）發表論文〈阿里山在哪裡？阿里山認知差異初探〉論述，台語「傀儡」（Kale）早在清初以前就是指鳳山以南東側內山族群的通稱，與阿里山遠在台灣府城北側兩天路程相差過遠，兩者也都早被列為「歸化生番」，不太會混淆。例如1855年劉家謀《海音詩》即清楚區分南到北傀儡社、阿里山十八社番、王字頭（泰雅族）。而鄒族對此山區早以Psoseongana（意為松樹之地）名之。:116-121除了現在台語中還保有「Kali」的音外，捨棄K音確也是台灣原住民語方言變化的常態之一，然此說亦無法與荷蘭、清初文獻阿里山的記載吻合。

外表與習性
雞距番擁有突出來的眼睛、大大的耳朵、頭髮剪短，以及像雞爪般的腳，這讓他們在地面上行動不易，但擅長在樹上生活，靈活的就像猴子，還很擅長射箭。牠們不常從樹上下來，除非是為了農耕和夜晚取水，若遇到其他原住民的話則會砍下他們的人頭帶走，但也有記載說他們一個月一次會跟附近的原住民交易。
此外，雞距番害怕槍砲，光是聽到聲音就會嚇的逃走。

分布
雞距番的巢穴主要分布於北部雞籠山附近，而內山深處也有叫做「嘟嘓」的部落是雞距番的村子。

現代研究
根據雞距番居住於內山深處及砍人頭的習俗可以判斷，雞距番是漢人將台灣原住民妖魔化的形象，其特徵也跟另一個將原住民妖魔化而成的怪人：獠人族相當類似。
另外，有人因為傳聞中雞距番的部落「嘟嘓」音似「太魯閣」，認為雞距番的真身就是太魯閣當地的原住民。

現身案例
據說在1772年（乾隆37年）7月時曾有一尾雲龍從傀儡山上現身，帶來徹夜大雨，造成林邊溪、力力溪溪水暴漲，使山下如佳冬鄉等地區發生相當嚴重的洪水。

現代研究

簡述
據說台灣有妖怪喜歡惡作劇，用石頭丟別人家的房子，造成石頭到處亂飛，甚至波及他人的情況，被稱為鬼石現象。

案例
台灣各地都曾出現過鬼石現象，如大稻埕、鳳山、中西等地，其中南屯更有人目擊到擲石的兩隻鬼怪，據說他們身上穿著布袋、身形畸形，看起來相當詭異，但當附近民眾要把他們抓起來時，他們卻突然消失無蹤。

外表
鬼蝶打開翅膀時大得跟手掌一樣，蝶翼上也有數十個眼睛，每拍動一下就會眨一下。

能力
傳說中當鬼蝶出現、特別是成群從天而降時，表示暴風雨即將來臨，這時船上的水手會將風帆收起。

類似物種
台灣和日本地區的紫斑蝶，會隨著季節而出現遷徙的現象，其中也有跨海抵達其他地區的案例，且牠們的翅膀上有不少斑點，跟鬼蝶傳說中的形象類似。

外觀與能力
魔尾蛇身長數丈（約十幾公尺到三十幾公尺），全身布滿花紋，尾巴上還有六根以上像花瓣般的觸角，碰觸到那些觸角或尾巴的人就會死亡。魔尾蛇的外型跟花紋因為其個體差異而有所不同，其中以「雙頭蛇」或擁有紅黑條紋的「紅黑間道蛇」最少見。
傳說中，魔尾蛇還會全身散發出毒氣，讓周遭的水域變得腥臭，毒霧會使船上的水手失神跌落海中；若魔尾蛇浮上水面，還會招來巨大的風雨。

棲息地
根據記載，魔尾蛇棲息於台灣海峽，主要是台灣和澎湖之間的黑水溝，以前的船員見到魔尾蛇的話會向牠們丟紙錢。

傳說
傳說過去在當地附近的潭水裡，棲息著一隻巨大的鯉魚精，牠長期騷擾附近的村落，讓居民的生活相當困擾。所以居民利用神明在夢中的指點，在潭水邊種滿毒魚用的魚藤，並把東面的山命名為「關刀山」，象徵用關刀斬斷魚藤，讓毒液流入潭中毒死魚精，後來鯉魚精果然沒有再作怪。而種魚藤的地方就被稱為「魚藤坪」（今龍騰地區）。

現代研究
關於鯉魚精傳說的起因，有人認為是當地傳說源頭的水潭形狀像一尾鯉魚，也有人認為是漢人入侵後和當地原住民發生衝突時，漢人只要逃至當地一座「歸安橋」的南邊便不會再受到追殺的傳說而來。
另外，傳說地點並非位於今日的鯉魚潭水庫，而是其西邊附近一帶，無法確認確切地點。

習性
鯉魚精有兩隻，一公一母、來自於太平洋，牠們只要遇到陽光便會幻化成石頭動彈不得，直到太陽下山才會變回來。牠們可以讓人生出雙胞胎（過去社會中雙胞胎被視為惡兆）。

傳說
過去這對鯉魚精經常在太陽下山後上岸來騷擾當地居民，而當地也住著一隻保護居民的山貓精，只要鯉魚精上岸便會追捕牠們，但一直被靈活的鯉魚精逃脫，直到有一天，在公鯉魚回到海裡後，母鯉魚卻因為來不及進入海中太陽便升起了，使讓牠和山貓精一起變成石頭，而剛好有一艘西班牙（一說荷蘭）的船隻經過，發現經過的「山」上有兩顆大寶石，便把它們挖出來帶走，但那兩顆寶石其實是母鯉魚的眼睛，失去眼睛的母鯉魚失去靈氣，再也無法變回原形，而山貓精看著自己的獵物沒有動靜，也因為貓的狩獵本能而保持不動，兩隻怪物分別變成鯉魚山和貓山。
另外，公鯉魚則在回頭看母鯉魚的時候照到陽光，變成了綠島（另有說法認為他跟母鯉魚一起變成鯉魚山）。

其他版本
關於鯉魚精的傳說另有其他版本，但大致上離不開貓追鯉魚的內容，如鯉魚精和山貓精原本分別是王母娘娘的宮女和玉皇大帝的雜差，某天，雜差奉命將祝壽禮送給王母娘娘，卻在路上被宮女嚇到、弄破了作為賀禮的天鵝卵，雙雙被打下凡間變成妖怪受苦，對鯉魚精恨之入骨的山貓精因此開始追殺鯉魚精，但最後兩隻妖怪都被當地另一隻妖怪：猴精給殺了，山貓精被吃掉、鯉魚精則被挖走雙眼，但猴精又被玉皇大帝下令電死，和其他兩隻怪物一起變成當地的猴子山；或是兩隻怪物因為相愛而荒廢了政事，被惹怒的天神將貍魚的眼睛挖去，還把牠們變成兩座山；還有故事為臺東平原的少年愛上原住民公主但遭反對，原住民頭目派人追殺少年，少年被迫自殺而化作鯉魚山，頭目不放心而請貓神看管他。
另外也有傳說認為當地的阿美族青年曾在鯉魚山中發現一件金光閃閃的寶衣，並且被族人推舉為番王，並且對抗荷蘭人的入侵，後來荷蘭人轉為對他示好，並用許多寶物番王交易，並換走了他的寶衣，鯉魚山上的眼睛也被挖走，番王在失去寶衣後因為說的話不再靈驗而被族人背棄、而且在鯉魚精喪失靈氣後，族內出生的胎兒和家畜都是瞎的，阿美族因此搬到馬蘭一帶居住。

現代研究
鯉魚精和山貓精的故事主要是源自當地的鯉魚山和貓山，兩座山因為在平原上極為醒目，是當地的地標，而且外表跟動物類似，而出現這樣的傳說。
另外，猴子山的命名其實來自於阿美族稱呼那座山為「Kawasan」，音近台語的「猴子山」而來，所以與猴精相關的版本很有可能是後人根據猴子山的名字、將其加入傳說中而杜撰出來的結果。

傳說
鯰精來自於村裡一個的池塘，牠因為覺得池塘太小而在其中打滾起來，激起泥沙和大水，甚至還作法下起大雨，淹沒附近的屋子和田地，居民非常害怕，向三山國王祈禱，三山國王因此降下雷電（也有說法是向雷公要求），成功霹死鯰精，而當地也就被叫做打廉（鯰）村。
另外也有說法認為作怪的是一對突然變成精的大鰱魚。

現代研究
關於打廉村的名字由來，有其他幾種說法，例如：這裡的客家人擅長打造鐮刀而有了「打鐮」的稱呼、或是當地的水潭外觀就像一條大鯰魚、又或者是認為「打廉」來自於「大廉」，「大廉」又來自於「大鯰」，也有說法認為「廉」是來自於水潭中所產的鰱魚，所以才會有鰱魚精的說法。
另外，「打廉」的名稱最早出現於1724年，但當地供奉三山國王的大安宮則是在1754年建造的，所以有可能當地的鯰精傳說是原本存在、後來加入了三山國王的元素；或是大安宮建立後開始流傳鯰精傳說，並套用到打廉的地名上。

其他
現今打廉村的活動中心外頭立有一個居民捕捉鯰魚的雕像，雕像下方還有記載鯰精的傳說。

地點
鰍魚精生活在恆春鎮以東約兩里（約一公里）的洞窟裡，洞窟深約六、七尺（約兩公尺左右），裡面有清澈的水和許多石柱。

傳說
因為鰍魚精經常從洞窟裡出來作怪害人，導致當地民眾苦不堪言，向上天祈求協助，隨即天上充滿了烏雲、霹下一道雷電，打中了洞窟中的一根石柱，而那根石柱剛好是鰍魚精的命脈，鰍魚精也因此而死亡。
後來，那個洞窟被稱作雷公窟。

其他
據說在二重溪橋旁「出火」景觀處附近，有一快中間有裂縫的巨大岩石，就是當初被打中的石柱遺留下來的。

傳說
傳說中，鷹哥和鳶妖是當地盤據的巨大妖怪，雙方互相對峙、吐出毒霧籠罩當地，直到鄭成功率軍經過時，因為在毒霧中迷失方向，且士兵還被鳶妖吞食，因此下令砲擊兩隻妖怪，鷹哥被打斷頸部、鳶妖則被炸斷下顎和鳥喙，兩隻妖鳥紛紛死亡，化為鶯歌石與鳶山，當時鳶山上還有留下被砲彈打中的痕跡。

其他傳說
另有傳說認為，鶯歌石本來就是顆長得像鷹哥的石頭，它會散發毒氣，並且碰到它的人或動物都會生病，之後才被斬斷頸部。另外，平溪也有吞雲吐霧的鶯歌精被打死變成白鶯石的傳說，跟鶯歌的傳說相當類似，很有可能是變體版本。
據說鶯歌石即使遭斷頸，惡意仍未消散，《桃園廳志》記載：「若誤觸此石，災殃忽臻，六畜斃而疫癘流行，地方感其祟，至今人民相戒，無敢近者。」類似日本的「殺生石」。
另外，也有說法聲稱賽夏族的夏姓家族以前在大溪、鶯歌、三峽一帶跟鄭成功的軍隊發生衝突，他們經常躲在石頭後面將路過的漢人殺掉，因此被誤認為是妖怪作祟而用大砲打它。

現代研究
事實上，鄭成功在占領台灣後很快就去世了，其勢力也沒有擴及北部區域，而且荷蘭在被鄭氏驅逐時，還佔領了北部一段時間，基本上是不可能來到北部。這則傳說很有可能是在鄭成功的信仰傳至北部後才逐漸出現、流傳開來的，而賽夏族傳說中的「鄭成功」很有可能也只是漢人的代稱，另外，「鶯歌」一詞最早源自「鷹哥」，之後變成「鸚哥」之後才又因改寫而變成「鶯歌」。

外觀與能力
麒麟颶跟一般的麒麟類似，龍首馬身，但其全身的鱗片和四足上都散發著火焰。當麒麟颶乘雲下山時，將會產生高溫滾燙的旋風，讓牠行經之處的地面被烤乾、植物枯死、甚至引起大火。

現代研究
從可以激起熱風、從山上下來等特徵可以推斷，麒麟颶是台灣漢族先民對於焚風現象的具體化形象，因此焚風也被稱為「麒麟風」。

傳說分布
麒麟颶的傳說主要出現在焚風比較頻繁的地區，例如台東、台中或屏東，廟宇中也可以看到麒麟颶而非麒麟的雕刻。

外表與能力
麞妖的外型是類似鹿的四蹄獸，但身形小得多，擁有一對獠牙，生性害羞，時常躲在草叢深處。牠們的啼聲就像嬰兒的哭聲，還會引來嚴重的火災；另有說法認為麞妖大叫，是因為看見打算製造火災懲罰當地居民的火神，而大叫提醒他們。

信仰
原本麞妖被當地居民視為妖怪，但隨著時間改變，麞妖逐漸被當地居民視為火神的象徵，並在半屏山上設立一個滅火神「解山王」（傳說中協助居民滅火的仙人）來鎮火，現已拆除。

其他傳說
不同於半屏山，在高雄其他多雨的地區，麞妖則跟水患有所連結：

壽山
麞妖長鳴後會在三天內帶來暴風雨

美濃
相傳在某年二月的時候，有隻麞妖從山上下來，沿路叫個不停，當地人認為這是大雨的前兆，三天內美濃果然降下大雨、造成水災，但因為麞妖的提醒讓所有人倖免於難，因此當地人認為麞妖是會鳴啼警示眾人的善良靈獸，每年二月都會舉辦「祭江河」的儀式，一方面祈求風調雨順、另一方面紀念麞妖的貢獻。

現代研究

根據外表可以判斷，麞妖的形象是來自於台灣特有種的山羌，從低海拔到三千公尺左右的山區都有分布，而麞妖在當地也被稱為「老山羌」。

特徵
關於黑狗妖的傳說有很多版本，其中大多數有以下特徵：

1.由狗骨幻化而成的黑色狗妖
2.擁有法力，經常向人作祟、危害居民的安全
3.性格頑強，就算神仙也無法使其服從
此外還有像是黑狗妖其實是術士幻化而成、或是牠們生性淫蕩等傳說。消滅黑狗妖的方法，多為把其根源的狗骨下鍋油炸，或是由道士、乩童甚至直接請神來將其消滅。

原型
黑狗妖的原型來自於臺灣犬科動物的臺灣犬，該種狗曾經普遍分布於臺灣，很早就被原住民飼養作為獵犬之用。

傳說
台灣許多地區都有黑狗妖的傳說，其中往往都是黑狗妖在民間危亂並且被制服、消滅的情節：

林口(新莊坪頂)
有戶農家婦女在丈夫外出的隔天醒來後，發現床上躺著另一個人，那人自稱是「黑山大王」，因為和她有緣而前來和她過夜，並且會賜予她福氣，婦女相信了。在來往幾次之下，婦人的妯娌察覺有異，試著審問她，後來當天晚上家裡全部的婦女都被玷汙，最後由其小姑找來道士避邪，道士在山下挖出一根上頭還長有兩寸長毛的骨頭，將它丟進油鍋裡煮，黑狗妖就再也沒有出現了。

淡水
有一隻黑狗妖曾出現在當地，以法術製造暴風擾亂居民的生活並吃人，後來跟朱王爺鬥法後被驅逐，當地人為了感謝祂的貢獻而建造和衷宮祭拜。
根據考證，當地黑狗精的說法是因為鄰近河口、風勢強大的關係。

六腳鄉
1911年，當地工廠在開工後，機械經常莫名故障、員工也發生意外，進展非常不順利。民眾認為是當地傳說的黑狗妖在作祟，就從鄰近的朴子配天宮迎來一尊媽祖鎮妖，而當把媽祖迎到工廠時，旁邊的小池塘裡就挖出了一具毛髮與骨肉俱全的狗屍，眾人連忙把它以法術下鍋油炸解決禍害。據說媽祖本來有意收服牠，卻反而被黑狗妖咬斷了手指。員工為了感謝媽祖而建立糖廠配天宮祭祀祂，而這尊媽祖也被稱為「會社媽」。

旗山
1949年，當地張家在晚上總是不得安寧、夜夜難眠，前往鯤洲宮請示，被上帝公表示有黑狗妖在作祟，並由乩童作法收服。

南投
有一隻被封印在吉仙宮附近的黑狗精變成一個石觀音，引誘想要學法術的人將自己的封印解開，並破壞附近村莊的農作物、吃掉當地的人和家畜、甚至讓居民一個接一個發瘋，最後居民請吉仙宮的觀音和松柏嶺受天宮的玄天上帝來作法鎮妖，在法事即將開始時，有一隻黑狗經過，被當作是黑狗妖而圍捕並逃進原本封印著黑狗妖的觀音洞內，眾人趁機把洞封起來並作法，村莊終於恢復了和平。

澎湖
澎湖各地都流傳著黑狗妖趁著神明不在廟宇裡時進入、獲得居民的香火想藉機升格為神的「竄殿傳說」，傳說中黑狗妖往往等到神明回來後就現出了原形並被下鍋油炸。有時黑狗妖也會變成貓精。
有人認為這樣的傳說是反映了澎湖廟宇的乩童人才不夠的窘境。

習俗
為了避免家裡的人被虎神們危害，民間演變出不少對應牠們的做法：

謝白虎；在竹籠裡放入金銀紙、經衣、白飯、豬肉、紙糊的老虎後拿去河邊祭拜，並把金銀紙與紙老虎一起燒掉，用石頭壓住殘灰，代表將惡虎送走。
如果被白虎神纏上，需要請道士或盲眼的占卜師來驅邪。

傳說
據說鄭成功廣東外海發現水中有兩抹光芒，派人潛下去發現是兩門銅砲，打撈起來後，其中一門化為龍飛入天際；另一門因為被綁著而留下來，並且很神奇地將自己身上的髒污和異物去除，變得金光閃閃、完全不像海裡的沉積物。後來鄭成功將那門大砲命名為龍碽、帶著它到處打仗，只要有龍碽出場的戰爭，那就必定勝利。
傳說中龍碽雖然大小跟普通的大砲差不多，但需要更多的彈藥才能打出去，威力也更加強大。它還擁有預知的能力，如果他們可以贏得戰爭，那只要幾個人便可以輕鬆將它拉動；但如果會輸的話，幾百個人來拉都拉不動。
後來在三藩之亂期間，劉國軒率領軍隊攻打泉郡，但龍碽因為預知到戰爭結果而不肯參戰，劉國軒硬是派人將它推上戰場，但放進去的砲彈卻也打不出去，劉國軒生氣得打它，龍碽便當場爆炸成粉末，傷及不少人。

其他傳說
傳說鄭成功曾帶著龍碽巡迴台灣，到處打敗路上遇到的妖怪，那些妖怪在死後也成為當地的地形景觀。
目前已知的妖怪有：

現代研究
事實上，關於那些地標景觀的傳說，也有其他的版本，鄭成功和龍碽並不是唯一的說法，且在占領台灣後，鄭成功很快就去世了，其主要的拓墾地區也都位於南部，並沒有時間前往除了台南地區以外的其他地方，且之後北台灣地區又被荷蘭佔據一段時間，又更不可能前往傳說位於的北台灣，這些傳說多只是後人杜撰或穿鑿附會之說。

外觀與傳說
龍銀狹義上是清領、日治時期政府發行的龍洋，但在台灣各地鄉野故事中，則是各種寶藏、財富的代稱。據說龍銀擁有靈性，特別是埋藏於地底的龍銀，會在特定的時間生出翅膀，能飛到天上或鑽到地底，它們會飛向擁有善德的人，給予他們幸福、但如果沒有善德的人拿到它們，則會惹禍上身，龍銀本身也會變成毒蟲或因某種原因立刻失去，代表非分之財、不得想望，有人也認為龍銀是土地公依照天意送的。
另有說法認為飛翔的龍銀本身只有福氣的人才可以看到，而且難以掌握，就算成功將它們從天上打下來也很容易飛走，必須要把它們放到蒸籠裡用大火蒸熟或放進紅布袋中才不會亂跑。
另外，澎湖也有龍銀自己長出腳跑到別人家的傳說。

案例
台灣各地都有龍銀的相關傳說，例如傳說中有一名牧童以竹竿敲下偶然遇見的龍銀，但砸傷自己的腳，直到花光那些龍銀的錢才痊癒、或是有一對善良的夫妻工作時偶然挖到一個裝滿龍銀的甕，被小偷聽到了，他趁著夫妻不在家時偷走甕，打開來卻是一群黃蜂，他買了一瓶黃蜂放進他們家想報復，但那瓶黃蜂又變成了龍銀；也有人抓到龍銀但被它們撐破裝著的籃子蓋而飛走、高雄許家之所以能飛黃騰達，據說也是因為他們發跡的家主許良馬成功得到一甕龍銀並蒸熟後，將它們放在好幾個小布袋中並連成一串，代表財富會「一代（袋）接一代（袋）」。

概要
歴史上の人物である大納言・坂上田村麻呂の母については一切不明であり、妻についても「清水寺縁起」で三善清継の娘・高子の名前が伝わるのみで詳細は不明である。
室町時代の京都で成立した御伽草子『田村の草子』では藤原俊仁が陸奥国田村郷の賤女と契りを交わして田村丸俊宗が生まれるが、作中では名前が登場しない。一方で『田村の草子』を底本として江戸時代の東北地方で演じられた奥浄瑠璃『田村三代記』では田村利光が陸奥国三春の悪玉姫と契りを交わして田村丸利仁が生まれるとあり、作中で名前が登場する。『田村の草子』では異類婚姻譚の種類が大蛇と賤女の二重だが、『田村三代記』では星の御子と大蛇と悪玉の三重の異類婚姻譚で田村丸利仁を強調している。『田村三代記』では、『田村の草子』など御伽草子系にはない田村利光による「御狩」が描かれる。『田村三代記』は第一群、第二群、第三群に分類され第一群は悪路王捜索の山狩りが主体となり、中世的説話を色濃く伝え、御伽草子からの古態を残す写本群となる。第二群では第一群にはない「将軍巻狩の段」や「塩竈神社の縁起」などが挿入され、七ツ森での壮大な巻狩が描かれる。どちらも御狩を通して「悪玉との契り」がもたらされる点は共通する。第二群が成立する過程で「悪路王討伐」が「奥州兵乱鎮撫」へと変化したのに合わせ、賤女に悪玉姫という名前が付会されたものと推測できる。

地方伝説
奥浄瑠璃『田村三代記』が盛んに語られた東北地方では、岩手県一関市の鬼死骸や奥州市衣川地域の霧山禅定など寺社縁起や地名伝説が『田村三代記』の内容と直接関係しつつ創出された。それらと同様に、『多賀城市史』でも悪玉御前と千熊丸の伝説は奥浄瑠璃『田村三代記』そのままであり、それが伝説化を遂げて定着したことは明らかであると記述している。

岩手県
岩手県紫波郡紫波町赤沢では飽玉伝説が伝えられている。

宮城県
石巻市
宮城県石巻市湊にある零羊崎神社では田村麿将軍・悪玉御前の木像が納められている。

大和町
宮城県黒川郡大和町吉田では悪玉姫伝説が伝えられている。

利府町
鹽竈神社の境外末社で利府町赤沼にある染殿明神とも呼ばれる赤沼明神は『田村三代記』において、刈安草は悪玉が千熊丸を産む際の血がかかって生じたもので、この明神に悪玉御前を祀ったとある。また利府町付近では産室原は悪玉が出産のときに産屋を建てたところ、胞衣桜は千熊丸の胞衣を納めたところ、子安観音堂は悪玉御前の守本尊を安置したところ、伊豆佐比売神社の九門長者屋敷跡は悪玉の主人が住んでいたところ、神谷沢の化粧板は悪玉が上洛するときに化粧をしたところとそれぞれ伝えられている。また沢乙温泉は坂上田村麻呂が同地出身の阿久玉姫と惹かれあい、地元民は阿久玉姫のことを沢乙女と呼んだことから、沢乙という地名になったと伝わる。

仙台市
宮城県仙台市若林区にある円福寺では、本尊聖観世音菩薩は聖徳太子作であり、田村将軍利仁の侍妾悪玉の護持仏で、利仁の子である田村麻呂を産んだ悪玉がここで所生したという。悪玉観音や子安観音と称されている。
宮城県仙台市泉区山の寺にある洞雲寺では『封内風土記』や「洞雲寺縁起」で、佐賀野寺とも称し、坂上苅田麻呂と利府の阿久玉女の間に産まれた千熊麻呂がこの寺で学んだとある。

秋田県
秋田県大仙市荒川村面日では阿久多摩姫伝説が伝えられている。

山形県
山形県では『奥羽観蹟聞老志』「長谷堂城の項」や、長井市の總宮神社などに田村麻呂による建立としている寺社は確認出来るものの、田村語りに関連した伝承は皆無に等しい。阿部幹男は、阿玉桜（伊佐沢の久保ザクラ）は、かつて山形県でも田村語りが語られていた痕跡ではないかとしている。

福島県
福島県郡山市田村町にある谷地神社は坂上田村麻呂の産みの親という阿口陀媛を祀る。近くには産湯に用いたという産清水も伝えられており、隣の高台には坂上田村麻呂没後1200年記念事業として森清範貫主揮毫の「伝 征夷大将軍 坂上田村麻呂公 生誕の地」碑が建てられ、千二百年大遠忌と共に同年に起こった東北大震災の犠牲者の諸霊供養の意が謹刻されている。

解説
悪玉姫 = 立烏帽子の亜流説
柳田国男は、『田村三代記』に登場する悪玉は立烏帽子の亜流であり、神変に通じた女であると結論している。

悪玉姫 = 山の神説
堀一郎は、論文「田村文芸の信仰背景」の中で田村も立烏帽子も山神神話の変化で、換言すればいわゆる武甕槌神と建御名方神の国津神に対する天神遊幸征討の中世的一形態であり、ないしは富士・筑波や蘇民将来の古風風土記伝説の文芸的展開でもあると論じている。
阿部幹男は、堀の論文を受け『田村三代記』は巫覡（修験、巫女、陰陽師）・盲僧がいだいた幻想によって創出されたもので、基本的構造は「山神の本地」の筋立と成巫儀礼の形態を用いた悪玉姫が登場する前半と、巫女の託宣形式を用いた立烏帽子が登場する後半で展開されていると論じている。
また醜悪な姿の山神は修験道の開祖・役行者や羽黒修験の開祖・蜂子皇子の姿で、性を越えて役行者の母や『田村三代記』の利仁の母・悪玉に引き継がれたとする。悪玉の他にも奥浄瑠璃『常盤御前鞍馬破』「役の行者誕生譚」の一節では大和国の悪女御前という女人が産んだのが役行者になったと語られ、説教節『苅萱』高野の巻では空海の母御は三国一の悪女が、軍記物語『源平盛衰記』では坂田金時の母上は足柄山に棲む醜悪なる山姥が登場する。阿部はこのような説話を「悪女説話」と称した。

悪玉姫伝説と坂上田村麻呂奥州誕生説
『坂上系図』別本（浅羽本）には坂上苅田麻呂について「陸奥国苅田郡誕生」、坂上田村麻呂について「奥州田村庄誕生」などと注記されていることから、父子ともに奥州誕生説がある。
高橋崇は、苅田麻呂と田村麻呂ともに奥州誕生説は「信ずるに足らぬ俗説にすぎない」としている。『鎌倉大草紙』をはじめ御伽草子『田村の草子』や奥浄瑠璃『田村三代記』などにもみえるものの、名前と地名との類似・共通性から後世に附会されたものであるとして「すべて信ずるに足らない」「伝説の域をでるものではない」と論じている。

概要
浅草寺（東京都台東区）の観音菩薩にまつわる伝説として江戸時代以後には書籍や演芸・芝居なども取り上げられ、広く知られていった。一軒家に棲む老女が宿泊する旅人をあやめて金品を奪っていたなどとする話は各地にみられ、これもそのうちの一例と見ることができる。
用明天皇の時代、武蔵国花川戸の周辺に浅茅ヶ原と呼ばれる原野があり陸奥国や下総国を結ぶ唯一の小道があったが、宿泊できるような場所がまったくない荒地で、旅人たちは唯一の人家であるあばら家に宿を借りていた。この家には老婆と若く美しい娘が2人で住んでいたが、実は老婆は旅人を泊めると見せかけ、寝床を襲って石枕で頭を叩き割って殺害し（『関八州古戦録』巻二では、天井から縄をつけた大石を落として圧殺したと記す）、亡骸は近くの池に投げ捨て、奪った金品で生計を立てるという非道な鬼婆だった。娘はその行いを諌めていたが、聞き入れられることはなかった。老婆が殺した旅人が999人に達した。ある日、ひとり旅の稚児（ちご）が宿を借りた。老婆は躊躇することなく、寝床についた稚児の頭を石で叩き割った。しかし寝床の中の亡骸をよく見ると、それは自分の娘だった。娘は稚児に変装して身代わりとなり、自分の命をもって老婆の行いを咎めようとしていたのだった。老婆が自分の行いを悔いていたところ、家を訪れていた稚児が現れた。実は稚児は浅草寺の観音菩薩の化身であり、老婆に人道を説くために稚児の姿で家を訪れたのだった。その後、観音菩薩の力で竜と化した老婆が娘の亡骸とともに池へ消えたとも、観音菩薩が娘の亡骸を抱いて消えた後、老婆が池に身を投げたとも、老婆は仏門に入って死者たちを弔ったともいわれている。

鬼婆が身を投げたとされる池は姥ヶ池（うばがいけ）と呼ばれてあり、現在も花川戸公園に残っている。池の大きさは、古くは隅田川に通じるほどの水をたたえた大きなものであったが、明治時代に宅地造成などのために大部分が埋め立てられており、かつての姿とはかけ離れたものとなっている。

浅茅ヶ原の鬼婆の登場する作品
和歌
白河院の作であるという和歌に、この伝説を詠み込んだ「武蔵には霞が関に一つ家の石の枕の野寺あるてふ」がある。この歌は、『関八州古戦録』では、「武蔵には霞の関屋ひとつ屋の石のまくらや野守あるてふ」と記される。

絵画
江戸時代後期には江戸で広く知られたものになっており、浮世絵や芝居の題材としても数多く取り上げられている。浅草寺（東京都台東区）には安政2年（1855年）の開帳のおりに奉納された浮世絵師・歌川国芳による大きな額の絵馬が保存されており、この伝説の一場面（諌める娘を恫喝する鬼婆）が描かれている。国芳には『木曽街道六十九次之内』（「大久手 一ツ家老婆」）や『本朝二十四孝』（「一ツ家の老女」）や『観世音霊験一ツ家の旧事』など、この伝説を描いた作品は他にも多い。その構図は生人形の興行としても再利用されてもいる。
歌川広重『東都旧跡尽』の「浅茅ヶ原一ツ家 石の枕の由来」では、天井からつり下げられた大きな石が画面には描かれている。月岡芳年は、『一魁随筆』（「一ッ家老婆」）や『月百姿』（「孤家月」）などの作品にこの伝説を描いている。

演劇
歌舞伎十八番に対抗して5世・6世尾上菊五郎が選定した歌舞伎演目「梅幸十種」あるいは「新古演劇十種」のうちには「一つ家」として、この伝説を題材とした戯曲が組み込まれている。この「一つ家」の芝居では、鬼婆は茨木（いばらき）、娘は浅茅（あさじ）、稚児・実は漢音菩薩の化身は花若（はなわか）という役名で登場する。

七不思議の組み合わせには諸説あり、7つ以上の伝承が存在する。飯倉義之監修の『江戸の怪異と魔界を探る』では10個の伝承が紹介されている。

代表的な七不思議
柳の井戸
港区元麻布の善福寺に現存する。
空海が水脈を穿ち、水が湧いたという。その後、水が枯れてしまい親鸞が柳の枝で再び水脈を開いたと伝えられている。また、空海が鹿島神宮の武甕槌大神に祈願をし、手に持った錫杖を地面に突き立てたところ、水が湧き井戸となったとも伝えられている。この伝承では、鹿島神宮にあった七つの井戸のひとつは、柳の井戸に水を与えたために、水が枯れてしまったと伝えられている。
近代では関東大震災や東京大空襲による断水から人々を救った井戸であり、東京の名湧水57選に選ばれている。

狸穴の古洞
港区麻布狸穴町の狸穴坂の坂下にあったという。
雌狸が住む大きな穴があったと伝えられている。また、遥か昔に銅が産出した間府穴（まぶあな）（銅を採るために掘った穴）があったとも伝えられている。

広尾の送り囃子
渋谷区広尾から道玄坂の一帯にあった広尾ヶ原での出来事。
夏から秋の月がよく見える晩に、広尾ヶ原を歩いているとお囃子の音が聞こえてくることがあったという。次第に自分のもとへと迫ってくるが、また次第に遠く離れていくと伝えられている。

善福寺の逆さ銀杏
港区元麻布の善福寺に現存する。国指定の天然記念物。
天然記念物指定名称は善福寺のイチョウ（ぜんぷくじのいちょう）。
善福寺に立ち寄った親鸞が、寺を去る際に持っていたイチョウの杖を境内の土に挿し、「念仏の求法、凡夫の往生もかくの如きか」と言ったという。すると、杖は根づき、大きな銀杏に育ったと伝えられている。

蟇池
港区元麻布に現存しているが池の大部分は失われている。
元々この蟇池には、千年も生きているという大がえるが住んでいたという。1821年大火で周囲の殆どが焼けてしまったにも関わらず、その大がえるが山崎治正の屋敷に水を吹きかけ、猛火を退けて類焼を免れたと伝えられている。

永坂の脚気石
港区麻布永坂町の永坂にあった。かなめ石とも呼ばれていた。
直径約30cmの石で往来の邪魔であった為、道路整備の際に取り除こうとしたが、いくら掘っても根が現れることがなく、そのまま放置されたいた。いつの頃からか、塩を供えてお祈りすると、足の病に効能があると言われるようになったと伝えられている。明治維新後に取り払われたという。

麻布の一本松
港区元麻布に現存しているが、明暦の大火で焼失し、その後も何度か植え替えられている。
羽衣の松や冠の松、お松様とも呼ばれていたという。この松の枝に甘酒を入れた筒をかけて、咳が治るように祈願する風習があったと伝えられている。信仰が厚かった頃には、松の番人がいたこともあったという。

初演
1938年11月にブダペストで作曲者の指揮により初演。日本初演は1941年、小編成に編曲した版が作曲者指揮、新交響楽団（現・NHK交響楽団）によって演奏された。オリジナル版は1944年、ヨーゼフ・ローゼンシュトック指揮日本交響楽団により初演。

内容
菟原処女の伝説を題材にした交響詩である。作曲者が初演時のプログラムによせた解説に寄れば、「一つの幻想曲として自由な形式にまとめたものであって、必ずしも個々の情景の忠実な描写音楽ではない。この作品の目指すところは古代の素朴な悲劇が持つ純粋に日本的な要素を交響管弦楽の形式において再現するところにある」ということである。

編成
フルート4（うち一人はピッコロ持替）、オーボエ3、コーラングレ1、バリトンオーボエ1、クラリネット3、変ホ調クラリネット1、バスクラリネット1、ファゴット3、コントラファゴット1、ホルン6、トランペット4、トロンボーン3、チューバ1、ティンパニ1、小太鼓1、大太鼓1、トライアングル1、シンバル1、タムタム1、ハープ2、弦楽五部。

楽曲構成
弦の低音部、クラリネット、コントラファゴットによって主題がゆっくりと静かに提示される。この主題は物語の悲劇的要素を示す物で、しばしば変形されて楽曲内に現れる。その後牧歌的な旋律となり、五音音階によるメロディも顔を覗かせる。主題がファゴットで現れ、「流れるように」という指示の下、主題を変形させた旋律が示される。16分音符による細かい下降音型の後、変形された主題の旋律が再び登場し、これと交替するかのように細かい下降音型が続く。この後「動きをもって」の指示で曲は徐々に大きく盛り上がりを見せる。それが静まった後に音楽は新たな局面を迎える。弦の保続音の上でコーラングレが朗々と歌い、バリトンオーボエに旋律は受け継がれる（この旋律も主題後半の変形である）。これが更に変形し、展開された後曲は開始部の田園的な情景に戻り物語を回顧するかのように閉じられる。

史実上の人物像
出自
晴明の系譜は不詳だが、中級貴族の大膳大夫・安倍益材（あべ の ますき）の子と伝わっている。
各種史書では『竹取物語』にもその名が登場する右大臣・阿倍御主人（みうし）の子孫とある。一部の古文書では安倍朝臣晴明ではなく安倍宿禰晴明と記載されるものも散見していることから、安倍朝臣姓の家系である阿倍御主人の子孫ではなく、安倍宿禰姓の家系である難波氏（難波吉士、のち忌寸、宿禰）の末裔説もある。

経歴
延喜21年（921年）に生まれたとされる。生地については生誕地を参照。
幼少の頃については確かな記録がないが、賀茂忠行・保憲父子に陰陽道を学び、天文道を伝授されたという。のちに賀茂・安倍（土御門）の両家は二大陰陽道宗家となる。
天徳4年（960年）40歳で天文得業生（陰陽寮に所属し天文博士から天文道を学ぶ学生の職）であった。その後の経歴は記録によって複数の説があるが、高田義人の整理によれば天徳4年に発生した内裏火災で焼損した霊剣鋳造の功労によって翌応和元年（961年）6月以降に陰陽師（官職）に任じられ、天禄元年（970年）に陰陽少属に昇進、
天禄2年（971年）には51歳で天文博士の兼任が認められた。
貞元2年（977年）、賀茂保憲が没した頃から陰陽道内で頭角を現す。陰陽寮を束ねる陰陽頭に就任することは無かったが、位階はその頭よりも上位にあった。その後、『占事略决』を撰した。
花山天皇の信頼を受けるようになり、記録にしばしば晴明が占いや陰陽道の儀式を行った様子が見られるようになる。花山天皇の退位後は、一条天皇や藤原道長の信頼を集めるようになったことが、道長の日記『御堂関白記』などの当時の貴族の日記から覗える。
そのほか、『小右記』によると、正暦4年（993年）2月、一条天皇が急な病に伏せった折、晴明が禊（みそぎ）を奉仕したところ、たちまち病は回復したため正五位上に叙された。
長保2年（1000年）10月、一条天皇の新造内裏遷御において、御輿が南階の前に到着する前に晴明は反閇（へんばい）を奉仕した。応和の前例では、陰陽寮が供奉して散供していたが、晴明が陰陽道の傑出者であるため奉仕した。
『御堂関白記』によると、寛弘元年（1004年）7月には深刻な干魃が続いたため晴明に雨乞いの五龍祭を行わせたところ雨が降り、一条天皇は晴明の力によるものと認め被物（かずけもの）を与えたことなどが記されている。
陰陽師として名声を極めた晴明は、天文道で培った計算能力をかわれて主計寮に異動し主計権助を務めた。その後、左京権大夫、穀倉院別当、などの官職を歴任し、位階は従四位下に昇った。さらに晴明の2人の息子（安倍吉昌、安倍吉平）が天文博士や陰陽助に任ぜられるなど、安倍氏は晴明一代の間に賀茂氏と並ぶ陰陽道の家としての地位を確立した。
晴明の邸宅は『大鏡』によると土御門町口付近、『今昔物語集』によると土御門西洞院北東（現在の京都市上京区土御門町・菊屋町）にあったとされる。

系譜上安倍晴明の後裔とされる家柄としては、堂上家では、安倍氏嫡流の土御門家と、江戸時代にそこから分家した庶流倉橋家があり、明治以降は共に子爵に列せられ、子孫が現存する。 ただし安倍晴明の男系血脈は、宇多源氏綾小路家の子で倉橋家の養子となった倉橋有儀（1738年 - 1784年）と、その息子で土御門家の養子となった土御門泰栄（1758年 - 1806年）の代で断絶しており、現在の土御門家・倉橋家当主はいずれも更に養子相続を繰り返した結果、戦国時代の安倍氏当主土御門有脩から数えて共に4回の女系を経ることで存続している。 一方、土御門有脩の娘が勧修寺晴豊の妻、土御門泰福の娘が倉橋泰章（土御門久脩から5代目の男系子孫）の妻、さらにその泰章の娘が萩原員領の妻になり、みな子を残しているため、勧修寺家・萩原家（蘒原家）をはじめとする幾つかの堂上公家・華族の子孫、および現皇室に、女系を経て安倍晴明の血脈が受け継がれている。
また、地下家の幸徳井家も、系譜上は賀茂氏であるが、家祖友幸が安倍氏出身であり、安土桃山時代の当主・友豊まで晴明の男系血脈が続いた。

創作作品での人物像
今日では平安時代の代表的な陰陽師のように扱われている晴明であるが、その名が広く知られることになったのは晴明を説話の登場人物として扱った『大鏡』や『今昔物語集』が出た12世紀前半、すなわち晴明の死から100年ほど後の時代のことと考えられている。
しかし、これらの作品の同世代もしくは少し後の作品である『江談抄』や『中外抄』には、他の陰陽師の名は出ても晴明の名前は登場しない。11世紀後半から12世紀後半にかけて陰陽道といえば賀茂氏と認識される時代が長く続き、一方で安倍氏の者の中にも陰陽道にその才を示すものがいたものの、早世や内紛なども多く不振の時代であった。そのなかで、晴明流の安倍氏が自らの立場の安定化のために、祖先である晴明の顕彰活動を行ったと推測される。
その甲斐があったのか、13世紀（鎌倉時代）に入ると『古事談』『宇治拾遺物語』『十訓抄』などに晴明の活躍が記されるようになった。
また、晴明が阿倍仲麻呂の子孫とする説話がある。

平安文学
『大鏡』- 帝紀「花山天皇」
花山天皇が帝位を捨てて出家しようと寺に向かっている時、晴明の家の前をちょうど通ったところ、「天皇が退位されるとみられる天変があった。式神一人内裏に参上して奏上せよ」という晴明の声が聞こえた。
『今昔物語集』
「代師入太山府君祭都状語」
ある僧が重病を患い、弟子たちは安倍晴明に泰山府君祭を行って僧の病気を治してほしいと頼んだ。晴明は、弟子の誰かが僧の身代わりとなって寿命を差し出せば、都状に名前を記して泰山府君に頼んでみると答えた。弟子の一人が身代わりを申し出たので晴明が泰山府君祭を行うと、師匠の病気はたちまち回復した。弟子は死を覚悟したが、夜が明けてもまだ生きていた。弟子が不思議に思っているところに晴明がやってきて、「泰山府君は弟子を哀れんだので師匠も弟子も共に助かった」と伝えた。
なお『曽我物語』『安倍晴明物語』に類似の説話がある。
「安部晴明随忠行習道語」
晴明が幼少の頃、賀茂忠行の夜行に供をしている時、夜道に鬼の姿を見て忠行に知らせた。忠行は晴明が優れた才能を持つことを悟り、陰陽道のすべてを教え込んだ。
陰陽道の大家となった晴明は、ある時播磨国から来た陰陽師（後述）に術比べを挑まれたが、いともたやすく懲らしめた。
仁和寺の寛朝僧正のところで、同席した公卿達に陰陽道の技でカエルを殺してみせるようにせがまれ、術を用いて手を触れずにカエルを真平らに潰した。
晴明の家では式神を家事に使っており、人もいないのに勝手に門が開閉していた。
「播磨国陰陽師智徳法師語」
播磨国の陰陽師、智徳法師が方術で海賊を捕らえた物語だが、末尾に「智徳はこれほど優れた陰陽師でありながら晴明にはかなわなかった」と記されているので、前の物語に登場した播磨の陰陽師は彼のことだとわかる。

中世文学
『無名抄』
かつて晴明が在原業平の家に祈祷して火の力を封じたので、業平の家は長らく火災に遭わなかった。しかし、末世には晴明の力も及ばなかったのか、とうとう焼けてしまった。
『古事談』- 晴明、花山天皇の前生を知ること
花山天皇は頭痛を患い、雨の日は特に痛んだ。晴明は天皇の前世が優れた行者であることを見抜き、前世の髑髏が岩の隙間に挟まっているので雨の日にひどく痛むのだと説明した。晴明は髑髏のある場所を指し示し、使者が髑髏を取り出すと天皇の頭痛は治まった。
『続古事談』
安倍晴明が大舎人だった頃、勢多橋を通りかかったところで、慈光から貴方は陰陽道の達者になる者だと告げられる。そこで、晴明は陰陽師具曠の許へ行き弟子入りを志願するが断られる。次に賀茂保憲の許へ行ったところ、保憲は晴明の才能を見抜いて弟子に迎え入れた。
晴明はもっぱら術法に長けた者であり、学問については特に優れていたわけではなかったと言われている。
ある時、晴明は保憲の息子賀茂光栄と議論をしていて、晴明が「生前、保憲は光栄を自分より上に立たせることはなかった」と言うと、光栄は「愛弟子と実の息子とでは違う」と反論した。晴明が「保憲は陰陽道に関する数多の書物を自分に伝授してくれたが、光栄には伝えなかった。これがその証である」と言ったが、光栄は「その書物は私の許にある。また、父保憲は自分に暦道を伝授してくれた」と言い返した。
『宇治拾遺物語』
「晴明蔵人少将封ずる事」
晴明がある時、カラスに糞をかけられた蔵人少将を見て、カラスの正体が式神であることを見破り、少将の呪いを解いてやった。
「御堂関白の御犬晴明等奇特の事」
藤原道長が可愛がっていた犬が、あるとき道長が法成寺に入るのを止めようとした。道長が晴明に占わせると、晴明は呪いがかけられそうになっていたのを犬が察知したのだと告げ、呪いをかけた陰陽師道摩法師を式神を使って見つけ出して捕らえた。
『十訓抄』にも同様の記述がある。
『平家物語』-「剣巻」
貴船神社に祈願し鬼となった橋姫の腕を渡辺綱が切り落とし、播磨守であった晴明が封印した。
なお「剣巻」を元に制作された能の演目『鉄輪』にも晴明はワキとして登場する。
『源平盛衰記』
「巻三 法皇熊野山那智山御参詣の事」
花山法皇が山に籠もっていると天狗が妨害してきたので、法皇は陰陽博士・安倍晴明を召した。晴明は狩籠の岩屋に多くの魔類を祀った。
「巻十 中宮御産の事」
治承2年（1178年）11月12日から、平徳子は産気づいたが出産しなかった。母である平時子が一条戻橋で橋占をしたところ、12人の童が同じ歌を歌って橋を渡っていった。昔、安倍晴明は天文道を究め十二神将という式神を使役していたが、晴明の妻は式神の顔を怖がった。そこで、晴明は呪いで式神を橋の下に隠し置き、必要な時だけ喚び出していたというので、12人の童というのは十二神将の化現だろうと推測された。
『古今著聞集』-「巻七 陰陽師晴明、早瓜に毒気あるを占ふこと」
晴明が早瓜を占ったところ、そのうちの一つの瓜から毒気を感じたので取り出してみた。僧正・観修が念仏を唱えていると瓜が揺れ始めた。藤原道長は医師・丹波忠明に毒気を治すように命じ、忠明は瓜に針を刺した。すると、瓜の動きが止まったので、源義家が刀を抜いて瓜を割った。瓜の中では小さな蛇が死んでいた。
『撰集抄』「巻八 一〇四 空也上人の手を祈ること」にも同様の説話が収録されている。

『簠簋内伝』
『簠簋内伝』は『金烏玉兎集』とも呼ばれ、後世に陰陽道の経典となる秘伝書。晴明が著者に仮託されている。

近世
『芦屋道満大内鑑』

この『芦屋道満大内鑑』を始めとして、晴明の父を安倍保名という人物、母を葛の葉という狐とする作品が存在する。

『安倍晴明物語』
浅井了意作の仮名草子。

現代
小説家の夢枕獏の書いた長編小説『陰陽師』の影響で平安時代に活躍した天才的な占い師や魔術師として様々なメディアで取り扱われている。

概要
一般の天女のように羽衣伝説と同様の説話が語られている一方、男性を求めて天から地上に降りて来るという説もある。それによれば、白い風呂敷を背負って現れ、その際にはどんな好天の日でも小雨が降るという。
地上で男性を見つけると、にやにやと笑って妖艶に誘惑する。男性がこの誘惑に負けると、命を奪われてしまう。また天降女子が柄杓を手にしていることがあり、その柄杓の中の水を男性が飲んでも命を奪われ、魂を天上へと持ち去られてしまう。
男性が誘惑された場合は、逆に睨みつけてやると天降女子の方が根負けして命が助かるという。また柄杓の水を飲む際は、杓子を持つ掌を上に向け、柄を支えるようにして飲むと命を奪われずに済むという。

伝説
後述する金長神社の社伝や、徳島県出身の考古学者・笠井新也の著書『阿波の狸の話』から伝説を要約すると、以下のようになる。
天保年間（1830年から1844年まで）、小松島の日開野（後の小松島市神田瀬町）での話。大和屋（やまとや）という染物屋を営む茂右衛門（もえもん）という者が、人々に虐められそうなタヌキを助けた。間もなく、大和屋の商売がどんどん繁盛し出した。やがて、店に務める万吉という者にタヌキが憑き、素性を語り始めた。それによればタヌキは「金長（きんちょう）」といい、206歳になる付近の頭株だという。万吉に憑いた金長は、店を訪れる人々の病気を治したり易を見たりと大活躍し、大評判となった。
しばらく後、まだタヌキとしての位を持たない金長は、津田（後の名東郡斎津村津田浦、現・徳島市津田町）にいるタヌキの総大将「六右衛門（ろくえもん）」のもとに修行に出た。金長は修行で抜群の成績を収め、念願の正一位を得る寸前まで至った。六右衛門は金長を手放すことを惜しみ、娘の婿養子として手元に留めようとした。しかし金長は茂右衛門への義理に加え、残虐な性格の六右衛門を嫌ってこれを拒んだ。
これを不服とした六右衛門は、金長がいずれ自分の敵になると考え、家来とともに金長に夜襲を加えた。金長は、ともに日開野から来ていたタヌキ「藤ノ木寺の鷹」とともに応戦した。しかし鷹は戦死し、どうにか金長のみが日開野へ逃れた。
金長は鷹の仇討ちのため同志を募り、六右衛門たちとの戦いが繰り広げられた。この戦いは金長軍が勝り、六右衛門は金長に食い殺された。しかし金長も戦いで傷を負い、まもなく命を落とした。
茂右衛門は正一位を得る前に命を落とした金長を憐み、自ら京都の吉田神祇管領所へ出向き、正一位を授かって来たという。
この戦いの頃、六右衛門へ攻め込む金長軍が鎮守の森に勢揃いすると、人々の間で噂されていた。人々が日暮れに森へ見物に押しかけたところ、夜ふけになると何かがひしめき合う音が響き、翌朝には無数のタヌキの足跡が残されており、合戦の風説も決して虚言ではないと話し合った。

異説
この伝説を紹介している書籍には、媒体によっていくつかのバリエーションがある。これは本来の地元の口承が後述する講談の影響を受けて変化したのではないか、とも見られている。

六右衛門の娘の名は「小安姫（こやすひめ）」。彼女は金長に恋焦がれており、金長を攻めようとした六右衛門側を批難し、ついには自刃することで父を咎めようとした。だが、小安姫の死によって却って六右衛門の憎悪が増長した。また、金長も、自分を愛してくれた小安の死を知り、打倒六右衛門の決意を固めた。

合戦の舞台である勝浦川を挟み、金長軍総勢600匹余り、六右衛門軍総勢600匹余りが対峙し、死闘は3日3晩に及んだ。
淡路島の化け狸である芝右衛門狸も、合戦に参戦しに阿波に向かった。（津田に向かう途中、二軒屋の観音寺にて武士の姿に扮して芝居を見ていたが犬に噛み殺され死体は三日間武士の姿のままだったという。このエピソードは浪速の中座での出来事が転用されたとみて良いと思われる。）
金長は合戦で致命傷を負ったものの、必死に日開野へ帰り、恩義ある茂右衛門に礼を述べ、力尽きた。その生き様に心を打たれた茂右衛門は、金長を大明神として祀った。
瀕死の金長は、霊となって万吉に憑き、死後も霊として永遠に茂右衛門の家の神として報恩を誓った。これに心を打たれた茂右衛門は、金長を大明神として祀った。
金長と六右衛門の戦死後、2代目の金長と六右衛門の息子との間で弔い合戦があったが、讃岐屋島（後の香川県高松市屋島）の化け狸である太三郎狸（屋島の禿狸）が仲裁に入り、合戦は終結を迎えた。

由来
天保年間には、大和屋に助けられたタヌキが恩返しをしたという動物報恩譚があったため、これを由来とする説がある。その後のある年、勝浦川の河川敷に多数のタヌキの死体があった事実が加わり、それらを講談のように仕立て、金長と六右衛門の二大勢力の激突の話が誕生したという説もある。
一方では、この合戦における争い、悲恋、葛藤などは人間社会でも珍しくなかったため、阿波狸合戦の実態は、人間社会での出来事をタヌキに置き換えたものとも考えられている。
徳島の修験道の霊山では別派同士の争いがあったこと、伝説を綴った古書『古狸金長義勇珍説席』で投石の場面があり、投石は中世以来の戦闘手段であったことから、太竜寺山と剣山との間で生じた修験道の争いがタヌキの伝説に仕立て上げられたのではないか、という説もある。この説においては、太龍寺の修験者が金長、剣山の修験者が六右衛門のモデルになったと考えられ、太竜寺山から北上しようとする勢力と剣山から南下しようとする勢力が衝突し、流派や拠点の異なる者同士の紛争に繋がった可能性が示唆されている。
また、徳島県では藍染めが盛んであり、その工程で砂を用いる。そして津田浦で採れる砂は藍染めに最適であった。よって、勝浦川の両岸地域で砂を巡る争いが起き、これが狸合戦の題材になったという説がある。さらに、津田地区と小松島の間の漁業権の争いがモデルになったとの説もある。六右衛門の史跡のある津田寺（後述）の住職である浅川泰敬も、この漁業権の争いを由来とする説を支持している。これらのように人間をモデルとする説が事実なら、どこか憎めないタヌキたちの姿は、実は愚かな人間たちの振る舞いの投影ということになる。
なおタヌキの話の真偽はともかく、茂右衛門は実在の人物であり、後述の映画『阿波狸合戦』も、講談本とともに茂右衛門の直系の子孫の家の口承をもとに制作されている。また万吉にタヌキが憑いた事件は、狸合戦とは別に実際に起きた事実であり、後の講談師がこの万吉の事件と狸合戦を結び付け、「阿波狸合戦」を創作したとする説もある。

関連する伝承
徳島県下の伝承によれば、阿波藩の時代、時の太鼓（時刻を知らせるための太鼓）が打ち鳴らされていたが、市内の富田大道では四つ時、寺町では六つ時だけ、太鼓が打たれなかった。これは、富田大道の金毘羅神社の末社に金長の2代目が「お四つさん」として祀られ、寺町の妙長寺に狸合戦に関係したメスのタヌキが「お六さん」として祀られており、それらと同じ名に相当する時刻に太鼓を打つと祟りがあるのだという。別説では、寺町には六右衛門の2代目が祀られたためともいう。

史跡
金長神社
1939年（昭和14年）5月、後述する映画『阿波狸合戦』の大ヒットの礼の意を込めて、日峰山の山中に金長神社（後の金長神社本宮）が建立された。1946年（昭和21年）には神社での「金長例大祭」が始まり、1955年（昭和30年）には、金長を称えて毎年まつりを実行する組織として「金長奉賛会」が結成されている。

1956年（昭和31年）、小松島市は報恩感謝の念に厚い金長の徳を称えるとともに、金長を観光資源にするため、それまで茂右衛門の末裔である梅山家の庭に屋敷神として祭られていた金長大明神を市内の中田町に移設するよう勧請し、翌1957年（昭和32年）に金長神社が建立された。映画『阿波狸合戦』制作時の新興キネマ京都撮影所長、建立当時に大映社長に就任していた永田雅一は金長を、倒産寸前であった新興キネマを救った救世主として、当時としては破格の百万円を寄付し、神社建設の資金はほとんどがこの寄付金で賄われた。境内の玉垣には永田のほか、羅門光三郎、長谷川一夫、京マチ子といった人気役者の名が彫り込まれた。
金長大明神は恩義ある茂右衛門に尽くした金長の徳の高さから「報徳狸」の名で崇められており、招福・開運守護の神としても知られ、商売繁盛にご利益があるともいわれる。徳島に数あるタヌキの祠の中でも代表的なものの一つであり、地元の人々は一般の祭神とは異なる距離感で金長と接し、親しみを込めて「金長さん」と呼んでいる。後述するアニメ映画『平成狸合戦ぽんぽこ』にも登場している。伝説上で金長が大和屋を守護していた関係で、神社建立以来、大和屋の子孫が宮司を務めており、2014年（平成26年）時点の宮司は茂右衛門から数えて6代目にあたる。
金長大明神は、山の中にある本宮に比べて足を運びやすい場所にあるため、徳島ばかりか関西方面からも参拝者が訪れており、平成以降においても参拝者が後を絶たない。一方で日峰山中の金長神社本宮は山の中ということもあり、平成期においては知名度は低い。小松島に金長神社が2つあるという事実もあまり知られていない。
2017年（平成29年）には、小松島市の都市整備に伴い金長大明神が取り壊しの危機に遭っていることから、同神社を守りたい有志により「金長神社を守る会」が結成され、ブログやTwitterなどでの活動において、金長の子分のタヌキである「小鷹」「熊鷹」の名義が用いられている。

そのほかの史跡
六右衛門側に関する事物としては、徳島市津田西町にある津田寺の墓地に、六右衛門側が砦としていたといわれる穴観音という洞窟がある。六右衛門は六右衛門大明神として祠に祀られており、祠を拝む人、掃除をする人も多い。六右衛門の息子の「千住太郎」、娘の「鹿の子」の祠もあり、親子ともども神として祀られている。
この津田寺には、かつて権右衛門（ごんえもん）というタヌキが住みついており、合戦時に六右衛門側の大将として戦死したといわれ、現在では同寺の祠に石像が祀られている。
金長と大鷹が六右衛門の追手と戦い大鷹が討ち死にしたとされる、大原町千代が丸にある「阿波狸古戦場跡」は大鷹大明神と萬狸大明神の祠がある。
合戦の主戦場とされる勝浦川北側の新浜本町2丁目付近には「阿波狸合戦古戦場」の跡と高坊主大明神の祠があり、激戦の末にタヌキの屍が川床を埋めた場所とされている。

講談
明治時代後期、当時の大阪で活躍していた講談師である神田伯龍がこの伝説を講談として舞台で披露したことで、この伝説は都会の芸能として全国的に広く知られるようになった。この講談は速記者・丸山平次郎の速記により講談本となり、1910年（明治43年)、『実説古狸合戦』『古狸奇談津田浦大決戦』『古狸奇談日開野弔い合戦』の全3巻で刊行された。同時期でタヌキを扱った講談としてはほかに、伊予国松山（後の愛媛県松山市）の化け狸である隠神刑部を描いた『松山狸問答』がある。こちらは人間が主人公であり、『実説古狸合戦』ほかの講談はタヌキを主人公として扱ったことが特徴的である。
伯竜による講談は、大筋は口承と大差ないが、一つ一つの行為を丁寧に描写し、ときには台詞を加えることにより戦闘場面の臨場感を盛り上げ、さらにタヌキを滑稽な動物としてではなく、人間と同様の心を持つ軍人として描いているという特徴がある。伝説上にない場面も多々あり、これらは創作と見られている。一例として講談本では、金長と六右衛門の2代目同士の戦いの場面があるが、タヌキとしてはあまりに綿密な作戦による戦いの様子が描かれている上、講談以前の関連書籍にそうした記述が存在しないため、それらは軍記物を得意とする講談師による創作と考えられている。伯竜自身も、講談本の中に原典とは変わってしまっている部分もあると説明している。
講談が人気を博していた要因は、時期が折しも日清戦争の時期であり、戦争の時代の社会において軍談、武勇伝、敵仇ちといった戦う男たちの物語が好まれたことや、タヌキたちが人間同様にときには仲間同士で助け合い、ときには名誉の戦死を遂げるといった物語が、講談を楽しむ人々にとって身近な存在に見えたことだと考えられている。また、民話において各土地を統括する親分級のタヌキは、神として祠に祀られたり多くの逸話に登場したりと、人々にとって身近な存在であり、特に金長や六右衛門は地域住民にとってのヒーローといえたため、土地の人々が仲間内でこうしたタヌキを語ることを通し、同じ知識を共有する仲間、同じ土地の人間としての絆が強まったとの見方ともある。
それから80年以上後の1996年（平成8年）、この明治の講談をリニューアルした『立体講談・阿波狸合戦』が小松島で上演された。さらに1998年（平成10年）、この立体講談を市民に語ってもらい、小松島の文化を継承していくため語り部の養成を小松市が企画。東京から講談師や講談脚本家を招き、語り部塾が市によって開講され、1999年の発表会を開催では大盛況を博した。 翌1999年（平成11年）に塾が終了した後、同年、塾生たち20人により「小松島語り部協会・御伽衆」が結成され、市内外の敬老会や福祉施設で講談や園芸を披露し、聴衆の笑いや涙を誘った。しかし後には高齢化などの事情になり、講談師は結成時の代表者1人だけの状態となっている（2008年〈平成20年〉時点）。

映画
講談の人気は明治37年ころを境にして失われ、タヌキの物語は、新たな娯楽である映画において別の形の展開を見せた。
1939年（昭和14年）映画『阿波狸合戦』が上映。制作は新興キネマで、当時倒産寸前だった同社は、この映画の大ヒットで倒産の危機を乗り越えた。また、それまで『阿波の狸合戦』『阿州狸合戦』などとも呼ばれていたこの伝説が『阿波狸合戦』の名でほぼ統一されたのは、この映画のタイトルが決定的だったとも見られている。1940年（昭和15年）には、新興キネマにより『続阿波狸合戦』が制作され、またも大ヒットとなった。その後も昭和20年代から30年代にかけ、タヌキをテーマとした映画が数多く作られ、人気を博した。
1994年（平成6年）、狸合戦をモチーフの一部とした アニメーション映画『平成狸合戦ぽんぽこ』が上映。四国の長老狸として「六代目金長」「太三郎禿狸」「隠神刑部」が活躍する中、金長が中心的役割を果たし、前述の金長神社も劇中に登場した。
2011年（平成23年）には徳島文理大学の人間生活学部メディアデザイン学科によりアニメ作品が製作された。同大学名誉教授でもある画家の飯原一夫に提案によるもので、地域活性化事業の一環として、同年12月に上映会が開催され、翌2012年（平成24年）に徳島市立徳島城博物館で開催された飯原の絵画展でも上映された。

徳島県内のまちづくり
小松島市
小松島市では狸合戦の史跡を始めとするタヌキ関連の事物をまちづくりに生かす取り組みが盛んであり、タヌキが町のシンボルとなって、町の随所にそのモニュメントやウォールアートが見られる。
金長をモチーフとした菓子「金長まんじゅう」（ハレルヤ製菓）は、小松島市の代表的な土産菓子である。「小松島といえば金長狸」との発想で作られた菓子で、映画『阿波狸合戦』公開時は、映画の大ヒットの波に乗って大人気商品となった。
1985年（昭和60年）の旧国鉄・小松島線の廃止を機に、小松島では民話をテーマとした地域の活性化の話題が持ち上がった。小松島線は、港湾都市として発展してきた小松島にとっては本線（牟岐線・中田駅）と港を結ぶ鉄道であり、これが失われると市の経済は大打撃を食らってしまう。大打撃を食い止めるために、地域活性化がより盛んになり、市内にタヌキにまつわる事物が増えてゆくこととなった。
いち早く着手したのが、市内の金長だぬき郵便局である。同局は旧名称の「小松島新港郵便局」から1989年（平成元年）に改名し、動物の名前が付いた全国初の局名として全国的な話題となった。当時の局長が、かつて映画『阿波狸合戦』を見て思い入れを抱いたこともあり、当時の地域の埋もれた素材だったタヌキに光を当てるため、金長をモチーフにした絵はがき作りなどの活動を続け、やがて局舎の改装に合せて局名の改名を発案。特定郵便局長会や小松島商工会議所などの応援を得ながら、四国郵政局（後の日本郵便株式会社四国支社、愛媛県松山市）に局名変更を申請した末、金長を売り込んできた長年の努力や地道な活動が認められ、局名変更が認可された。動物の名前の郵便局の例がまったくないことから、認可にあたって郵政省ではかなり議論があったという。開局に合せてタヌキを描いた葉書や切手、スタンプなどを製作したところ、全国の郵趣家たちから申し込みが殺到するに至った。市内にはタヌキの像の飾られた郵便ポストも見られる。
1991年（平成3年）には小松島市内の若者たちにより、金長狸をイメージした太鼓「金長太鼓」が結成された。陽気で明るく愉快な演奏であり、これまでの和太鼓のイメージを打ち破るとの声もある。
1993年（平成5年）には、小松島ステーションパークに世界最大の金長の銅像が完成した、高さ5メートル、胴回り5メートル、重さが5トンあり、小松島市のシンボルでもある。観光客からも人気がある。タヌキの置物としては信楽焼が有名であり、信楽（滋賀県甲賀市）には全高8メートルのタヌキの置物がある。だが銅像としてはこの小松島ステーションパークの銅像が世界一である。このステーションパークには、合戦に登場するタヌキも石像として並んでいる
『平成狸合戦ぽんぽこ』が公開された1994年にはウォールアート事業の一環として、小松島市運輸部ので市営バスの車体がタヌキのデザインで飾られた。大好評を受けてさらに2台のバスが作られ、その後も5台まで作られ、市内を運行している。
5月の連休には金長神社を中心に「金長まつり」が開かれ、タヌキ神輿のパレード、金長太鼓の披露などの催しが行われている。毎年11月に開催される「阿波の狸まつり」は、20数万人の客を集める一大イベントであり、タヌキを倶楽部マスコットに掲げるプロサッカーチームの徳島ヴォルティスも、ブースを出店して会場盛り上げに一役買っている。
2012年（平成24年）には、金長をモチーフとしたゆるキャラ「こまポン」が登場した。名称は小松島市内の小学校6年生から募集した中から選ばれた。源義経をイメージした武具を着たタヌキの姿で、刀の代りに小松島市特産の竹ちくわを手にし、Facebookを通じての小松島市の観光情報発信など、小松島市観光PRマスコットキャラクターとして活躍している。同2012年にはこまポンにちなみ、竹ちくわを食材とした料理「こまポン焼き」も、市の市街地活性化検討会により開発されている。

徳島市津田地区
徳島市津田地区では、金長と敵対した六右衛門がシンボルとされている。伝説上では恩返しをするなど義理堅いとされる金長に対し、六右衛門は映画『阿波狸合戦』の影響もあって悪役に仕立て上げられており、このことに不満を抱く津田地区民も少なくない。また金長側の小松島市でも、かつては六右衛門を悪いタヌキとするイメージが強かったものの、戦後の平和な時代には人々の考えが変化したこともあり、金長の師匠として六右衛門を評価する声もある。
前述の金長まんじゅうに対し、津田西町の和菓子屋である吉本湖月堂では「六右ヱ門饅頭」が発売されており、同店の看板商品となっている。伝説上で敵対関係となった金長と六右衛門とは異なり、六右ヱ門饅頭の発案者である吉本湖月堂創業者・吉本利明（ - 1982年）と金長まんじゅうの発案者であるハレルヤ製菓の創業者・岡武男（ - 1996年）は、同業者として旧知の仲である。岡は金長まんじゅうの売り出しに際し、当時すでに六右ヱ門饅頭を売り出していた吉本のもとを訪ね、意見交換を行なっていたという。
1995年（平成7年）より津田地区社会福祉協議会考案によるまちおこしイベント「六右衛門まつり」が開催されており、出店、子供太鼓、阿波踊り、県指定無形民俗文化財「津田の盆踊り」などで好評を博している。
2014年（平成26年）に開催された第20回六右衛門まつりでは、小松島商工会議所の協力のもとに「六右衛門狸・金長狸の交流宣言」が表明され、六右衛門の着ぐるみが登場、前述のこまポンと握手をかわし、江戸時代から対立していたタヌキ同士が170年ぶりに和解を果たしたと報じられた。

そしてこの男女は因縁のまま輪廻転生するが、道成寺の住持の読経の供養により成仏するという仏教説話である。

概説
安珍・清姫伝説は、主人公らの悲恋と情念をテーマとした、紀伊国（和歌山県）道成寺ゆかりの伝説である。
原型とされる平安時代の『大日本国法華験記』（『法華験記』）・『今昔物語集』所収の説話には、熊野参詣の僧と、宿の寡婦とだけ記され、名は言及されていない。安珍の僧名は『元亨釈書』（1322年）が初出で、清姫の名は1742年初演の浄瑠璃に初めて見える。よって安珍清姫の名を冠した作品や絵巻物等の稿本は、おおむね江戸時代以降ということになる。
室町時代の『道成寺縁起』（上下巻、絵巻、重文）でも、主人公らは無名である。
能（謡曲『道成寺』）、歌舞伎（『娘道成寺』、総じて「道成寺物」という作品群）、浄瑠璃（『日高川入相花王（ひだかがわいりあいざくら）』『道成寺現在蛇鱗（げんざいうろこ）』）など、後世にさまざまな題材にされてきた。
道成寺では、絵巻物（後期の写本・摸本類）を見せながら絵解き説法をおこなっているが。昭和の時代に文言を多少アレンジして作成された「千年祭本」および、書写は新しいが古形にちかい「道成寺縁起絵とき手文」が台本としてあるものの、実践においては台本通りでない（例えば清姫が年齢13歳であるというこの両本にある記述は口にされない）。
「略縁起」と名のつく稿本も複数存在する。また、絵解きの影響で、江戸時代にはこの伝説が「略縁起」の形で刊行され、数多く頒布されてきた。

あらすじ
伝説のあらましは、おおむね次のようなものである。
奥州白河（現在の福島県白河市）から安珍という僧（山伏）が熊野に参詣に来た。この僧は大変な美形であった。紀伊国牟婁郡（現在の和歌山県田辺市中辺路、熊野街道沿い）真砂の庄司清治・清次の娘清姫は宿を借りた安珍を見て一目惚れし、女だてらに夜這いをかけて迫る。安珍は僧の身ゆえに当惑し、必ず帰りには立ち寄ると口約束だけをしてそのまま去っていった。
欺かれたと知った清姫は怒って追跡をはじめるが、安珍は神仏（熊野権現・観音）を念じて逃げのびる。安珍は日高川を渡るが、清姫も河川に身を投じて追いかける。蛇体となりかわり日高川を泳ぎ渡った清姫は、日高郡の道成寺に逃げ込んだ安珍に迫る。安珍は梵鐘を下ろしてもらいその中に逃げ込む。しかし清姫は許さず鐘に巻き付く。因果応報、安珍は鐘の中で焼き殺されてしまう。安珍を滅ぼした後、本望を遂げた清姫はもとの方へ帰っていき、道成寺と八幡山の間の入江のあるあたりで入水自殺したといわれる。
畜生道に落ち蛇に転生した二人はその後、道成寺の住持のもとに現れて供養を頼む。住持の唱える法華経の功徳により二人は成仏し、天人の姿で住持の夢に現れた。実はこの二人はそれぞれ熊野権現と観世音菩薩の化身であったのである、と法華経の有り難さを讃えて終わる。

以上のあらましは、大筋では室町時代の『道成寺縁起』の粗筋と合致するが、ただし『縁起』には安珍・清姫の名が登場しない。道成寺で行われる絵解きの台本『道成寺縁起絵とき手文』（仮綴。原本は江戸時代末）が、『縁起』絵巻に沿った構造で、原文も盛り込み、かつ安珍・清姫の物語となっている。
同寺の絵解きでは、ビジュアル的には『道成寺縁起』の摸本を使うものの、語り部の台詞の資料としては安珍・清姫の名のある（古めかしい言葉遣いの）台本を使いつつ、全く台本通りではなく現代語に直しながら語られる。より詳しい内容などは後述する。

伝承の経緯
原型
上述したように、その原型には『大日本国法華験記』（巻下第百二十九「紀伊国牟婁郡悪女」）の説話があり、これが『今昔物語集』巻第十四第三「紀伊ノ国道成寺ノ僧写法華救蛇語」に伝承されている。原文をくらべると前者は漢文で、後者は読み下してあるが、ほぼ同文である。
『法華験記』本のあらましでは、庄司の娘の代わりに、牟婁郡の寡婦（必ずしも未亡人とは限らない）が熊野参詣の旅中の僧らに宿を提供する。また、宿泊するのは老若二人の僧である（懸想されるのは「其形端正」な若い僧）。言い寄られた若い僧は（流布説話と同様に）参詣を終えた後にまた立ち寄ると口約束して旅立つが、いっこうに戻ってこない。逃げられたと怒った寡婦は部屋に籠り、体長五尋の毒蛇に変化、僧を追って（熊野参詣道をたどり）、道成寺で鐘に隠れた僧を焼き殺す。そして（流布する伝説と同様）、道成寺の高僧の夢枕に、その若い僧が蛇の姿で現れ、自分は蛇の女の夫になりこの姿になってしまったと嘆き、法華経「如来寿量品」を写経して納め供養をしてほしいと懇願する。老僧が所望の供養のための法会をおこなったのち、ふたたび夢に現れ男は兜率天、女は忉利天となり往生したと満悦そうに報告する。
渡辺保は『大日本法華経験記』に記される話について、不自然な点があると指摘している。例えば女がなぜ部屋にこもると大蛇に変じたのか、また道成寺では大蛇に変じた女から逃げる若い僧を、なぜ鐘の中に隠したのかなどである。そうした点が見られるのは、「古い日本の伝承を無理に仏教の霊験譚にこじつけた結果」だという。女が部屋にこもって蛇になったのは、「仏教渡来以前の日本人の古代の死生観」によるもので、そして「もとになった説話が、道成寺という寺の縁起にまつわるものでも、法華経の功徳にまつわるものでもなく、鐘の縁起にまつわるもの」であり、「この物語が本来鐘にまつわる説話だった」とする。また『今昔物語集』所収の話は『大日本法華経験記』と同内容であるがその細部は異なっており、例えば女が蛇に変ずる場面でも、女は一旦死んだとされた後、その寝室から蛇となって出てくる事になっている。これは「一種の合理化であって、あの古代の変身は消えて、女の亡霊という形で蛇の存在が説明」されたものであり、そういった合理化によって伝承の物語化がされ、「文学化」が行われたと述べている。

道成寺縁起
原型（平安時代の説話）から、やがて道成寺の縁起物（室町時代から江戸時代）に発展した。江戸期の写本や摸本を数多く道成寺では所蔵する。
なかでもとりわけ有名な稿本は、道成寺蔵『道成寺縁起』（絵巻、2巻2軸、重文）であるが、これは寺伝では応永十年（1403年）
後小松天皇の宸筆により書きしたためられたもので絵は伝・土佐光重筆だが、現代の検証では16世紀前半ないし15世紀後半の成立と推察される。
時代設定は、醍醐天皇の御代、延長6年（928年）夏の頃とある。
『道成寺縁起』では、主人公の女は真砂（まさご/まなご）の清次の「娵（よめ）」と書かれているが、これは清次の「妻」のことだとも「子供の妻」である嫁（義理の娘）だとも解釈されて、見解が分かれているようである。
その相手は奥州出身の美男子な僧（「見目能僧」）と記される。女は僧に「かくて渡らせたまえ」（しばらくいらしてください）と迫るが、これは夫になってくれとの口説きだと解釈される。後日、再会を約束したはずの僧はとうに通り過ぎて行ったと知って出立した女房は、切目王子の社を過ぎた上野という場所で追いつき呼びかけたが、僧は頭巾、負厨子、念珠などをかなぐり捨てて逃げたので、女は上体蛇と化し火を吹いて追いかけた。僧は塩屋を過ぎ、日高川を船で渡って逃げたが、女は衣を脱ぎ捨て全身蛇体となって泳ぎわたる。以上の部分も、残りの部分も、上述の安珍清姫伝説と比べて大きな違いは無い。僧は道成寺に駆け込んでかくまわれ、鐘の中に隠されるが、女房の大蛇は尾で堂の戸を壊し、鐘の竜頭（りゅうず）を銜（くわ）えては鐘に巻きつき尾でこれを打ち鳴らすと火焔がまきおこった。「3時あまり」（6時間余?）経ってやっと大蛇は「両眼より血の涙を流し」離れていったが、鐘を消火してみると骸骨だけの炭のような遺体がみつかった（以下略）。

賢学草紙・日高川草紙
異本である酒井家旧蔵『賢学草子絵巻』（伝・土佐広周筆）では、「姫君」と「賢学（けんがく）」とあり、関連本である武蔵野大学本もまた然りである。この両本は本文において様々な相違がみられるが、ともに「古寺」とあり「道成寺」と明記されない、にもかかわらず、酒井家旧蔵本には「右、道成寺之絵一巻者..」との加証識語が加えられている。この摸本/粉本（ふんぽん）として和歌山県立博物館蔵『日高川草紙』」があり、山沢与平（1886年没）の筆とされる。
「道成寺縁起」の異本にはまた根津美術館蔵の『賢学草子』（または「日高川草紙」と称す）があり、遠江国橋本宿の長者の娘「花ひめ（花姫）」と、三井寺の若き僧「けんかく（賢学）」となっている。賢学は花姫と結ばれる運命だという天啓を夢に見、修行の妨げとなることを恐れて、遠州にいる幼い花姫の胸を刺して逃げる。その後賢学は一目惚れした娘と結ばれるが彼女の胸の傷から成長した花姫その人であると気付き彼女を捨てて熊野へ向かう。花姫は彼を追い、ついに蛇となって日高川を越えて追いすがる。とある寺に逃げこんだ賢学は鐘の中に匿われるが、蛇と化した花姫は鐘にとぐろを巻いてそれを湯のごとく溶かし、賢学を掴みだしたのち、川底へと消えていった。その後弟子たちが二人を供養したという。
『賢学草子』（別名『日高川草紙』）の諸本（酒井家旧蔵本系統・根津美術館本系統のいずれも含む）は、『道成寺縁起』に比べると""宗教色が希薄で「御伽草子」的要素が強い""話筋である。刃傷沙汰による殺人未遂の段こそ欠けるが、酒井家旧蔵本系統の『賢学草子』も、破戒僧であることにかわりはない。ここでは賢学が清水寺に籠っているときに姫を見初め、恋文をやりとりし契りを交わすが。賢学は悔恨して、熊野詣に出、滝に打たれる修行に打ち込むが（異本では那智滝）が姫に見つかり邪魔をされ、道成寺へと逃げ込む展開となる。

安珍・清姫の名の嚆矢
これらのいずれにおいても安珍・清姫の名はまだ見られず、安珍の名の初出は『元亨釈書』（1322年）である。ただし鞍馬寺に居たことになっており、後の奥州白川の僧という設定と異なっている。また、出身はみちのくであるが（現・宮城県角田市藤尾の東光院の山伏・住持）、京都の鞍馬寺で修行したと辻褄を合わせている民話が角田市界隈に伝わる。
安珍を山伏とみるべきか、そうでなしかとみるべきか考察があるが、能楽の『道成寺』で「山伏」と設定されている。草紙では『道成寺縁起』絵巻や『賢学草子』の詞に「山伏」としていないが、挿絵は山伏姿に描かれている。
清姫の名の初出は並木宗輔作の浄瑠璃『道成寺現在蛇鱗』（寛保2/1742年初演）とされる。浄瑠璃『道成寺現在蛇鱗』（宝暦9/1759年）にも清姫の名はみえる。なお、清姫の名は、その父親の名とされる庄司の清次からとられていると目される。
清姫の年齢は文献に拠って13歳, 16歳など様々である。""現行の絵解きでは清姫の年齢には触れないが、二種の絵解き台本には「此の姫十三の時、又僧の参られまして」(『道成寺縁起絵とき手文』)、「清治と申す人の姫で、時に年拾三歳で御座いました」 (千年祭本『道成寺縁起絵とき』)""とみえる。『安鎮清姫略物語』（文政年間の刊行）でも「わらはもはや今年十三歳に及べり」。また、酒井家旧蔵本『賢学草子』等では「姫君十六になり侍るに」とあり、その写本である『道成寺絵詞』でも当然16歳である。""常磐津""だと清姫は「十六七な、白歯の振袖の女の娘」。
草紙では系統に関わらず蛇は""本の所に去""りゆくだけなのに、台本系統では道成寺と八幡山の入江の橋の下に沈んで果てることになっている 。そしてその入江はのちに陸地となり、""田の中にありまする蛇塚（へびつか/じゃつか）""がその標榜だと伝える。

伝承内容の相違
平安時代の古い文献などが伝える伝承と、後の伝説では相違点もうかがえる。
『大日本国法華験記』本は、道成寺で僧を焼き殺す点は一致しているが、蛇道に堕ちた二人を成仏させた僧にも前世からの因縁があったとしている。
また『法華験記』では女が寝屋に籠って蛇となるが、「道成寺縁起」では途上で徐々に蛇に変化していく様子が描かれる。
『今昔物語集』では、あえて「若き」寡婦とされ、また部屋に籠って死んだ後に「五尋ばかりの大蛇」に変身している。

ゆかりの地名の記述
『道成寺縁起』絵巻や、絵解きでは現地の地名がことこまかに説明されることが知られる。
以下、縁起や絵解きで説明される、僧/安珍と蛇姫/清姫の道成寺までの道のりのゆかりの地名を絵巻や台本に沿って説明する。

切目川より
（切目王子～上野～塩屋）
当寺では地元の地名をいくつもからめてこの道中が伝えられる。姫は切目川を渡り、切目五体王子の神社の先（北西）の上野という場所で追いつき、あのときの御房（僧）でないかと声をかける。しかし記憶にない、人違いだと否認したため、姫は激昂して火煙（火炎）を吹きはじめ、安珍は恐怖をなして念仏（「南無金剛童子」、次いで「南無観世音」等）を唱える。その甲斐あって（塩屋に）逃れるが、見失ったことに怒りをつのらせた清姫が、ここで（首から上が）蛇と化する。

日高川
安珍は日高川で渡し船に頼みこみ渡ってしまうが、現代の絵解き（千年祭本）だとここで熊野権現への祈りが通じて、清姫がいわば不動金縛りになった隙に逃げ出す、という脚色があるかわりに、脱衣するという表現をさけて「かような姿になった」と絵を指し示す演出になっているが、もとは清姫が衣服を川辺に脱ぎ捨てて全身もろとも毒蛇となり、日高川を渡る場面となっている。

釣鐘の顛末
解説によっては、隠れ場所につかった道成寺の鐘は、清姫の炎によって融解してしまったと説くが、『道成寺縁起』の文章では、上述したように何時間は燃えていたが水で消火して鐘を除けたことになっているので、鐘が残存したものととれる。
ところが能楽の『道成寺』では、""鐘は即ち湯となつて、終に山伏を取りお終んぬ""という描写になっている。鳥山石燕の妖怪画集『今昔百鬼拾遺』にも「道成寺鐘」と題して伝説の絵図があり、安珍の隠れた鐘は、蛇と化した庄司の娘がまきついて、「鐘とけて湯となるといふ」としている、にもかかわらず、件の鐘は、石燕の時代には妙満寺に納められているという事も併せ述べられている。

後日談
安珍と共に鐘を焼かれた道成寺であるが、四百年ほど経った正平14年（1359年）の春、鐘を再興することにし、逸見万壽丸が寄進した。二度目の鐘が完成した後、女人禁制の鐘供養をしたところ、一人の白拍子（実は清姫の怨霊）が現れて鐘供養を妨害した。白拍子は一瞬にして蛇へ姿を変えて鐘を引きずり降ろし、その中へと消えたのである。清姫の怨霊を恐れた僧たちが一心に祈念したところ、ようやく鐘は鐘楼に上がった。しかし清姫の怨念のためか、新しくできたこの鐘は音が良くない上、付近に災害や疫病が続いたため、山の中へと捨てられた。
さらに二百年ほど後の天正年間。豊臣秀吉による根来攻め（紀州征伐）が行われた際、秀吉の家臣仙石秀久が山中でこの鐘を見つけ、合戦の合図にこの鐘の音を用い、そのまま京都へ鐘を持ち帰り、清姫の怨念を解くため、顕本法華宗の総本山である妙満寺に鐘を納めた。
伝統芸能でも前記「後日談」の部分が用いられることが多く、そのため安珍を直接舞台に出すことなく女性の怨念の物語として世界を展開することができた。

江戸期の伝統芸能
芸能を主に、様々な作品の題材として広く採りあげられた。

能 : 『鐘巻』（廃曲だが復元が試みられている）。これを大幅に省略した謡曲『道成寺』のみが逸失せず伝わる。『鐘巻』については、従来は観阿弥（1384年没）、世阿弥（1443年没）の作とされてきたが、観世小次郎信光（1516年没）（横道萬里雄説）も有力視されており、これだと成立年代もだいぶ下ることになる。
長唄 : 『紀州道成寺』
常磐津：『道成寺伝授ノ睦言』
荻江節 : 『鐘の岬』
義太夫節 : 『日高川』 ※このページの冒頭に表示されている画像は、このお芝居の一場面である。
人形浄瑠璃 : 『日高川入相花王』（ひだかがわいりあいざくら）宝暦9年、大坂竹本座で初演された。四段目「日高川渡し場の段」が特に有名で、この段だけが独立して上演されることも多い。清姫から逃れて日高川に至った安珍は、渡し船で対岸へ渡り、船頭に金をつかませて「あとから追って来た清姫を決して乗せるな」と言い含めた。そうとは知らず血相を変えて追いかけて来た清姫は対岸まで乗せてくれと船頭に懇願するが、安珍に買収されている船頭は聞き入れてくれない。安珍の卑劣さと船頭の頑迷さに激怒した清姫が後先も考えずに日高川へ飛び込むと、忿怒のあまり清姫の身体は大蛇へ変じ、そのまま川を泳ぎ渡る。この変身ぶりが見どころのひとつで。清姫の文楽人形の頭（かしら）は「ガブ」という特殊なものが用いられており、人形遣いが仕掛けの糸を引くと、美しかった清姫の頭に二本の角が生え、目は金色に見開かれ、口が大きく裂けて鋭い牙が剥き出しになる。また、川水に見立てた浪布が舞台上で所狭しとうねり、その中を清姫がある時は人間、またある時は大蛇の姿となって泳ぎ渡ると観客の昂奮はピークに達する。　
歌舞伎 : 『京鹿子娘道成寺』、『奴道成寺』、『二人道成寺』、『男女道成寺』
組踊 : 『執心鐘入』玉城朝薫作、1719年初演。王府奉公のために都へ向かう十四歳の中城若松は、旅の途中に宿泊した家の女主人に激しく求愛されるが拒絶し、宿を逃げ出すと、末吉の寺へ逃げ込んだ。一旦は鐘の中へ隠れた若松だったが、僧の勧めで鐘から出て、別の場所に身を隠した。その後、若松を追って寺まで来た女は、「今に不審やあの鐘」と言うが早いか、鐘の中へ籠り、やがて鬼女となって姿を現す。鬼女が吊られた鐘の中で逆さになり、上半身だけを外に出して僧と対峙するという演出は、人形浄瑠璃『日高川入相花王』や歌舞伎『京鹿子娘道成寺』などにも無い大胆なもので、この演目独自の魅力のひとつである。なお、鬼女は結局のところは、僧たちに祈り伏せられて退散する。

地域の口承文学
また、真砂の里では別の伝説が行われている。大きな相違点を挙げると以下のようになる。

清姫の母親は実は、男やもめであった父が助けた白蛇の精であった。
初め安珍は幼い清姫に「将来結婚してあげる」と言っていたが、清姫の蛇身を見て恐れるようになった。
安珍に逃げられた清姫は絶望し富田川に入水、その怨念が蛇の形をとった。
蛇にならず、従って安珍も殺さず、清姫が入水して終わる話もある。
さらに異説としては、清姫は当時鉱山経営者になっており、安珍が清姫から鉱床秘図を借りたまま返さないので、怒った清姫やその鉱山労働者が安珍を追い詰めたという話がある（「清姫は語る」津名道代〈中辺路出身〉)。
わらべ歌 に 『道成寺』（道成寺のてまり唄。和歌山県。作者不詳）がある：

トントンお寺の道成寺
釣鐘下（お）ろいて 身を隠し
安珍清姫 蛇（じゃ）に化けて
七重（ななよ）に巻かれて 一廻（まわ）り 一廻り

史跡
伝説の舞台となる道成寺には安珍塚がある。
「上野というところ」の北西、旧・名田村大字野島（のしま）（現今の御坊市名田町野島）に清姫が履物を脱いだと史跡と称する草履塚があり、近くには袈裟掛松も生えていた。
また、清姫が入水して果てたのは道成寺と八幡山のあいだの入江であるという地元伝承があり絵解きなどで伝えているが、その入江のあった陸地にある清姫の「蛇塚（じゃつか/へびつか）」""がその名残と伝わる。これとは別に清姫の墓と伝えられる石塔が、清姫の生誕地とされる真砂（現在の熊野古道の中辺路付近）にある、
ほか、清姫渕、衣掛松、清姫のぞき橋、鏡岩など、伝説にまつわる史跡が数多く残されている。
熊野古道潮見峠越えにある田辺市指定天然記念物の大木・捻木ノ杉は、清姫が安珍の逃走を見て口惜しんで身をよじった際、一緒にねじれてしまい、そのまま大木に成長したものといわれる。
妙満寺に納められた道成寺の鐘は、現在でも同寺に安置されており、寺の大僧正の供養により清姫の怨念が解けて美しい音色を放つようになったとされ、霊宝として同寺に伝えられている。毎年春には清姫の霊を慰めるため、鐘供養が行われている。道成寺関連の作品を演じる芸能関係者が舞台安全の祈願に訪れていた時代もあり、芸道精進を祈願して寺を訪ねる芸能関係者も多い。

地域の祭りなど
中辺路では毎年7月頃、安珍・清姫伝説をテーマとした「清姫まつり」が、清姫が入水したとされる富田川の河川敷で開催されており、蛇身となった清姫が火を吐く様子などが再現されている。
和歌山県みなべ町の常福寺の盆踊りに「安珍・清姫伝説」を題材にした盆踊りが行われている。
安珍の生地とされる白河市根田では、安珍の命日とされる3月27日に、墓（後年、村人が供養のために建てたもの）の前で安珍念仏踊り（福島県無形民俗文化財）が奉納されている。

比較文学論・類話
『古事記』の本牟智和気王説話に出雲の肥河における蛇女との婚礼の話に類似性があり、誉津別命が参詣の旅の途中、宿泊先で女を娶ったとときその姿を覗き見て正体が蛇であることに気付き畏れて逃げ出すが、大蛇に海を越えて追いかけられ大和へと逃げ延びるという内容である。
また、『賢学草紙』では、賢学が清水寺で姫を見初める展開になっているが、『清玄桜姫』において恋愛に没落する清玄も清水寺の僧なので関連性が指摘されている。
上田秋成原作『雨月物語』の中に『道成寺』を元にしたと思われる『蛇性の婬』と言う話が載っている。
吹田に伝わる民話に、太左衛門という男が新田で草刈り中に誤って大蛇の首を落としてしまった後、首だけの大蛇に祟られて最期は鐘に隠れたところを焼き殺されるという、道成寺伝説によく似た結末の民話がある。

遠州七不思議の1つに数えられる。

概要
標高約880mの「亀ノ甲山」北側の標高650m付近には、くぼ地が広がっており、普段は何の変哲も無いスギやヒノキが生えた林となっている。ここに、およそ7年周期で夏の終わりに突然池が出現し、数日から20日間というごく短期間のうちに水が引いて、元のくぼ地に戻る。こうしたことから出現した池は幻の池とも言われ、池が出現すると、その神秘的かつ幻想的な光景から毎回多くの観光客で賑わいを見せる。
出現する池の規模は縦70m、横40m、水深1.2mほどである。
池の成因は詳しく解明されておらず、「斜面に降った雨水が、1～2ヵ月後に崖下泉として湧き出してできる」、「草木の保水力によって雨水が集まってできる」などの説があるが、確たる説はない。
なお、アメリカの陸水学者であるジョージ・イヴリン・ハッチンソンによる湖沼の類型化（1957年に75種類の湖沼の型を発表）にも、このような特殊な湖沼についての記述はみられない。
池の出現地点の付近には、水窪観光協会が設置した、池に伝わる言い伝えや伝承について説明する立て看板がある他、この地で没したと伝えられるおかわ御前を祀った祠が建立されている。

池の平の出現日
1954年（昭和29年）
1961年（昭和36年）
1968年（昭和43年）
1975年（昭和50年）8月26日
1982年（昭和57年）8月11日
1989年（平成元年）9月8日
1998年（平成10年）10月2日 - 7年の周期から外れ、前回の出現から9年が経過。
2010年（平成22年）7月20日 - 前回出現時より12年後に出現。
2011年（平成23年）9月11日 - 前回に続き、2年連続で出現。
2020年（令和２年）7月
池の出現する間隔は「7年に一度」と言われているが、異常気象などにより降水量が少ない年には出現しない事がある。近年では、1998年以降連続して周期から外れており、「7年に一度」というのはあくまで目安に過ぎない。なお、1989年以前の出現記録を基準に考えた場合、2010年は7年周期で出現する年に当たる。

池にまつわる伝説
「おかわ御前」の伝説
1569年(永禄12年)、高根城が敵の攻撃を受けた際、城主民部少輔貞益の後室だったおかわ御前は、子供を連れて敵の攻撃を逃れ池の平に逃げ込んだが、子供が泣き出したために追っ手に見つかり、殺害されてしまった。以降、おかわ御前の無念の涙が溢れて水が湧き出すようになった。
竜神の休息伝説
桜ヶ池に住む竜神が諏訪湖に赴く際、池の平で休息するという。

民俗
日本ではイルカを食す地でも、その食を忌む地でも、海豚参詣の民俗が伝わる。地方によっては、宮参り、墓参り、観音参り、磯部様参りなどと呼んでいた。また、イルカの群れが縦一列に並ぶさまを、イルカの千本づれや千匹ガチと呼んでいた地方もある。
元々は、イルカが黒潮に乗って海上を集団で北上する姿が、寺社に集団参詣する人の群れに似ていることから、これを擬人化して「参詣」と称することになったと思われる。
民俗学者の柳田國男は、『海上の道』の末尾に、『知りたいと思う事二、三』を書き残した中のひとつに「海豚参詣のこと」をテーマに掲げ、以下の様に考えた。

当時77歳だった柳田は、学問の新展開を促す目的で上記のような文章を書き、海豚参詣について、「海の彼方との心の行進いが、もとは常識だった名残ではないか」と推察を残した。そして、柳田の弟子の折口信夫は、「常世」（とこよ：海の彼方にある異世界）からやってくる「客人」（まれびと：この場合はイルカ）を通じて、共同体を再生させるというマレビト信仰が古くから日本にあったという論を唱えた。

青森県
青森県青森市の栄町にある諏訪神社に海豚参詣の伝承が伝わる。その伝承は、1786年（天明6年）に工藤白龍が記した『津軽俗説選』に書かれた。内容は、祭日にイルカの群れが堤川を遡り、川のそばにある諏訪神社を参詣するというものである。これを諏訪神社では「海豚の諏訪詣伝説」と称している。
八戸市の鮫の西宮神社に鯨石と言われる石があり、八戸太郎と名付けられた鯨が姿を変えたものだと伝わるが、その伝承の一つの形に、八戸太郎は伊勢参りをしていたとするものが存在する。

岩手県
岩手県大船渡市の赤崎に海豚参詣の民俗が伝わる。大船渡湾にやってきたイルカの群れは、湾の最奥に近い野島という小島の周りを三回まわって再び出て行くといわれ、その理由は、イルカは仲間の霊を弔うためとされていた。民俗学者の中村羊一郎は、これは、海豚参詣の伝承の類例が少ない太平洋側の東北地方における貴重な事例だと指摘している。
岩手県遠野市には、遠野の沢のお不動様の祭祀に川を遡って鮫が参拝に来ると言い伝えられていることが、柳田國男著の『遠野物語拾遺』の33話目に記された。

新潟県
新潟県上越市の五智に「海豚参詣」が伝わる。泉鏡花の『湯女の魂』（ゆなのたましい）では、五智の五智国分寺にある五智如来をイルカが参詣することに触れている。
柏崎市の番神堂にも「いるか番神詣り」が伝わる。柏崎沖を通るイルカの群れを指す。
柳田國男の指摘では、新潟県佐渡市（佐渡島）に海豚参詣は伝わる。佐渡の盆踊りの歌詞の一節に「達者の伝次が焼けた、いるか殺したその罰で」とあり、これをイルカを殺した報いを受けたものだと解釈した。

東京都
伊豆諸島の新島に「海豚の磯部さま参り」の伝承が伝わる。また、式根島に「鯨の富士山参り」の伝承が伝わる。

三重県
三重県四日市市富田の鳥出神社の富田の鯨船のはじまりは、伊勢参りの途中の親子鯨を仕留めたことで、富田の浜に水揚げが無くなる祟りがあったためと伝わる。

三重県志摩市の渡鹿野島（旧志摩郡磯部町域）などに、『七本鮫の磯部参り』という伝承が伝わる。旧磯部町の伊雑宮（いざわのみや）の6月の祭祀に合わせて、7本のサメが参詣に訪れ、渡鹿野島で休息をとるとの伝承が有り、祭祀の当日は、命や目を取られると、漁師は出漁を自粛し、海女は潜水しないものとされていた。この海女の休漁日をゴサイという。

愛媛県
愛媛県宮窪町（現・今治市）の鯛崎島（たいさきじま）の鯛崎鼻に鎮座する石地蔵は、鯨が参りに来る伝承がある。昔、座礁した鯨を石地蔵が助け、以後、鯨は石地蔵に参拝すると伝えられる。この話は『まんが日本昔ばなし』の「クジラのお礼参り」にて知られる。

佐賀県
佐賀県唐津市の呼子町に、大宝山参りの鯨が伝わる。伝承の内容は、夢枕で命乞いをした鯨を捕ってしまった鯨組が嵐で全滅するというものである。

長崎県
長崎県西彼杵郡に、漁師の夢枕に参詣に行く旨を告げた鯨がいた伝承がある。また、平戸市大崎に、志々伎山参りを行う鯨が漁師に打たれ、漁師の孫に銛が刺さる報いを受ける伝承が伝わる。
昔からの捕鯨地の長崎は似た話が多く分布する。佐世保市宇久町（五島列島の宇久島）が舞台の山田紋九郎の鯨伝説が知られている。捕鯨で莫大な富を築いた網元の山田紋九郎に、五島の大宝寺参りに行く親子鯨が夢枕に立ち、命乞いを受けるも、当時飢えていた鯨捕りたちは無視して出漁し、その親子鯨を捕ろうとして、嵐に飲まれ、72人が死に、それがきっかけで山田紋九郎は鯨捕りを止めたという伝説である。

後の創作
宮崎県日南市には紙芝居『油津の大鯨物語』があり、紙芝居では、鯨が伊勢参りをしている設定となっている。しかしながら伝承では、油津の不漁（大嵐とも）が続き、漁民に飢えが起きた時、漂着鯨が有り、それを食べて助かった。鯨は大きく、近隣で分け合った。鯨は体内に子を宿しており、親子どもども供養したら、豊漁となった。村人たちは感謝し、「鯨もち」を作り、鯨魂碑に供えるようになった。という内容であり、伊勢参りのくだりは近世にこの紙芝居を製作した市民団体により創作されたものである。

概要
経蔵の鍵は藤氏長者が代々受け継いで一切経会の日に開扉されるといい、藤氏長者が就任後はじめて訪れる「宇治入り」のとき以外は人の立ち入りが厳重に管理された。渓嵐拾葉集巻九二「雑記部」によれば、藤原頼通は死後に龍神に姿を変えて宇治川に棲んだとされ、丑の刻になると川から姿を現して経蔵を見回ったという。

収蔵品
御伽草子などの書物では、宇治の宝蔵に酒呑童子、玉藻前、大嶽丸の首や遺骸が納められたとされ、これら日本三大妖怪の遺骸や遺骸の一部は宝蔵の所有者が妖怪の霊力に勝る武力・知略・神仏の加護を所有している象徴とされる。他に『源氏物語』「雲隠」なども収蔵されたという。
ただし宇治の宝蔵は空想世界のことであり、現実世界の宇治の宝蔵にはこれら収蔵品が含まれたという記録はない。

概要
最も著名な事例が後述の享和3年（1803年）常陸国のものであるが、それ以外にも寛政8年（1796年）加賀国見屋のこし、元禄12年（1699年）尾張国熱田沖、越後国今町、正徳年間伊予国日振島、明治16年（1883年）神戸沖などの記録がある。
『風姿花伝』によれば、官人としての活動を終えた秦河勝は難波からうつぼ舟に乗り込み坂越に至ったという。
『鸚鵡籠中記』元禄12年（1699年）6月5日条に熱田に漂着したという「空穂船」について以下のような記述がある。ただし同書には後世の加筆部分も存在することが指摘されており、空穂船の描写が後に加筆された可能性もないわけではない。

柳原紀光『閑窓自語』には、寛政8年（1796年）に「加賀見屋のこし」に漂着した異国の小舟の記述がある。

『折口信夫全集』第三巻に収録されている「霊魂の話」（初出は『民俗学』第一巻第三号・郷土研究会講演、 1929年9月）には、折口信夫や柳田國男のうつぼ舟、かがみの舟に対する考察が記載されている。それによると、うつぼ舟、かがみの舟は、「たまのいれもの」、つまり「神の乗り物」である。かがみの舟は、荒ぶる常世浪を掻き分けて本土に到着したと伝わっていることから潜水艇のようなものであったのではないか、と柳田國男は述べている。
また、折口信夫は、うつぼ舟は、他界から来た神がこの世の姿になるまでの間入っている必要があるため「いれもの」のような形になっていると説いている。
虚舟の形状については常陸国の事例の図版が有名であるが、それ以外には虚舟の形状について記述された史料は殆ど存在しない。箱舟と書かれた史料が若干存在するのみである。

常陸国のうつろ舟
虚舟の伝説の中でも最も広く知られているのは、享和3年（1803年）に常陸国に漂着したとされる事例である。江戸の文人や好事家の集まり「兎園会」で語られた奇談・怪談を、会員の一人曲亭馬琴が『兎園小説』（1825年刊行）に『虚舟の蛮女』との題で図版とともに収録され今に知られているほか、兎園会会員だった国学者・屋代弘賢の『弘賢随筆』にも図版がある。この事例に言及した史料は現在までに7つが確認されており、内容には若干の異同がある。
『兎園小説』の記述する内容は以下のようなものである。

享和3年（1803年）2月22日、寄合席・小笠原越中守の知行地・常陸国はらやどりという浜で、沖に舟のようなものが見えたので浦人が小舟を出して浜に引き寄せた。
舟の形は香盒のようにまるく長さ3間余り、上は硝子障子でチャン（松脂）で塗り込め、底は鉄の板がねを段々筋のように張っている。
船中には図（※ページ右上挿図参照）のような蛮字が多数あった。
図のような異様な姿の蛮女がおり、眉と髪は赤く、白く長い入れ髪をしており、言葉は通じず、2尺四方の箱を持ち離そうとしない。
調べると水2升ほど瓶に入っており、敷物や菓子、肉を練ったような食べ物がある。
浦人が議論したところ、古老が「蛮国の王の娘が嫁いだ後に姦夫と密通したため、男は処刑、女は虚舟に乗せられて生死を天に任せたもので、箱の中身は男の首ではないか。昔もこのようなうつろ船に乗せられた蛮女が近くの浜辺に漂着したことがあったと伝わっている」と言い、官府に報告すると雑費もかかるため、もとのように船に乗せて沖へ引き出して流した。
最近浦賀沖に現れたイギリス船にもこのような蛮字があったと言うから、思うに件の蛮女もイギリス、ベンガラ、アメリカなどの蛮王の娘ではないだろうか。
魯西亜聞見録には女の衣服は筒袖で腰から上を細く仕立て、髪の毛に白い粉をかけて結ぶとあるから、魯西亜属国の夫人ではあるまいか（※滝沢馬琴による頭注）。
2014年に発見された『伴家文書』に、兎園小説で書かれた虚船の漂着地「はらやどり」が「常陸原舎り濱」とあり、原舎り濱は現在の神栖市波崎にある舎利浜であることが判明した。
柳田國男は「うつぼ舟の話」（『中央公論』1926年4月初出、『妹の力』1940年所収）において、『兎園小説』の記述に関しては「駄法螺」と断じているものの、作り話であっても人が信じるだけの「何か基づく所」があったとみて、それは常陸国豊良浦に漂着したと伝わる金色姫伝説であるとしている。
うつほ舟に書かれていたとされる文字について、佐藤秀樹は錬金術記号であると指摘している。特に3文字目の「🜣」は「銅サフラン」を表す記号と完全に一致し、他の字も「🜂（「火」を表す）」や「🝨（「浸す」ことを表す）」に別の要素を加えたものだと説明している。なお、錬金術記号は江戸時代の日本でも「蘭学者芝居見立番付」（『芸海余波第一集』所収）で役者番付に見立てた蘭学者の紋所として使用されていることが見える。
佐藤は『藤岡屋日記』に文化4年（1807年）正月16日に下総国海上郡銚子筒賀浦豊浦湊に「金源盛」という名の唐船が漂着した記述があることを指摘する。また平田篤胤は文化露寇・フェートン号事件に関する資料を集めて『千島の白波』（『新修平田篤胤全集補遺5』所収）を編纂しているが、その中に、文化4年（1807年）6月18日の津軽鯵ヶ沢での龍徳丸船頭・吉五郎の談話として、此度のロシアの大将が女性であるという風説に続けて、去年択捉島に小舟で女2、3人が上陸して歩き回っていたため一時牢屋に入れたが、前々から交易のために来ていた女商人だったため許され帰されたという内容が記録されている。佐藤は、元来金色姫伝説の素地がある地域に、現実の唐船の漂着や文化露寇の発生を契機として、ロシアの大将が女性だという風聞やロシア風俗の文献を取り込んで形作られたと説明している。また「うつろ舟」の造形も真後ろから見た西洋船をもとにしていると指摘している。

UFO事件としての調査
一部の古代宇宙飛行士説論者はうつろ舟を地球外や未知の文明由来の産物として取り上げている。うつろ舟の漂着を「江戸時代のUFO飛来事件」、「日本のロズウェル事件」と主張する者もいる。
また一般的な科学的研究と歴史検証を行った事例として、岐阜大学名誉教授であり、量子光学の専門家である田中嘉津夫は、川上仁一の忍術を伝える伴家の古文書から「うつろ舟奇談」に関わる史料を調査し、漂着地の実在地名が「常陸原舎り濱」(現在の神栖市波崎舎利浜）と記されていることから、うつろ舟に関しての記述に具体性があるとの論説を発表した。この論説は地元の新聞社や大手のマスメディアでも取り上げられた。
また「水戸文書」の記録では、円盤型の乗り物には円盤の周囲に謎の文字が標記されていることも確認できる。ロズウェル事件の飛行体にも謎の象形文字が中の操作室に記されていたとの噂や証言も存在することから、ロズウェル事件に酷似しているとの指摘もある。これらの言説がオカルトマニアや海外のUFO研究家の間でも話題を呼んでいる。

対馬のうつぼ舟
対馬にもうつぼ舟やそれに類似する伝承が多く存在する。例えば以下の通りである。

対馬市の久原の伝承では、浜に流れ着いた朝鮮王族の姫から財宝を奪って殺し、その祟りで佐奈豊の村が滅んだというものがある。
久原から程近い女連の佐奈豊には、朝鮮出兵時に某という武将によって対馬に連れて来られた（あるいは不義をして舟で流された）宣祖の娘（李昖王姫）のものとされる墓がある。
上対馬町の三宇田には、「はなみごぜ（花宮御前）」という高貴な女性が財物と共に流れ着いたが、三宇田村の住人に殺害され財物を奪われ、祟りを恐れた住人は花宮御前を祀ったものの、祟りのせいで住人は絶え村は廃村となってしまったという伝承がある。ただし、花宮御前は黒田藩の女性であり、キリシタンとなったため、黒田藩を追い出され三宇田に至ったという伝説も存在する。
豆酘には高皇産霊尊とされる霊石（高雄むすふ）がうつぼ舟に乗って流れ着いたので、神として祀られた（現在も多久頭魂神社内に高御魂神社がある）。
天道法師の母は一般的に内院の照日某の娘とされるが、都にて不義をして懐妊し、対馬に流され着いた女官とする伝承も存在する。
豊玉町貝口には、高貴な姫とその侍女達や宝物が流れ着いたが、住人が姫達を殺害して宝物を奪ったという伝承がある。

その他
茨城県鉾田市大竹海岸（鹿島灘海浜公園）には、虚舟の形をしたモニュメントを兼ねた遊具が設置されていた。

2人の男から求婚された娘が自ら命を絶ち、男達も後を追って死んでしまったというもの。

あらすじ
兵庫県神戸市の東部地域から芦屋市域にかけてが、当時の難波の先の湾の湿地帯に茂る葦（あし）を材として屋根を葺いた家々のあったことに由来する「葦屋（あしのや）」の地名で呼ばれていた頃の話である。
菟原処女（うないおとめ）という可憐な娘がいて、多くの若者から思いを寄せられていた。中でも同じ里の菟原壮士（うないおとこ）と、和泉国から来た茅渟壮士（ちぬおとこ）という二人の立派な男性が彼女を深く愛し、妻に迎えたいと激しく争うようになった。娘はこれを嘆き悲しみ、「卑しい私のために立派な男たちが争うのを見ると、生きていても結婚などできましょうか、黄泉で待ちます」と母に語ると自ら命を絶ってしまった。茅渟壮士はその夜、彼女を夢に見て彼女が愛していたのは自分だと知り、後を追った。菟原壮士も負けるものかと小太刀をとって後を追った。その後、親族たちは集まって、このことを長く語り継ごうと、娘の墓を中央に男の墓を両側に作ったという。

文学
万葉集
奈良時代末期に成立した『万葉集』では、田辺福麻呂歌集（「過葦屋処女墓時作歌一首」9-1801～2）、高橋虫麻呂歌集（「見菟原処女墓歌一首」9-1809～11）、および、福麻呂・虫麻呂に追和した大伴家持の歌（「追同処女墓歌一首」9-4211～12）の3組が、いずれも菟原処女墓（うないおとめのはか）について詠んだ短歌として知られている。
高橋虫麻呂の本歌「見菟原処女墓時作歌一首 并短歌」と反歌を以下に挙げる。

大和物語
平安時代に書かれた『大和物語』ではこの伝説が脚色され、舞台は生田川となり、娘の親が男たちに難題を出し、3人の死後に墓を作ることについて争いが起きたとされている。

求塚
観阿弥または世阿弥の作と伝えられる謡曲『求塚』では、男たちは刺し違えて死んだことになっている。
人形アニメーション作家・川本喜八郎は、1979年（昭和54年）、この謡曲を基に上映時間19分の人形アニメーション映画『火宅』を製作している。

戯曲『生田川』
明治時代の文豪・森鷗外は、この伝説を題材として戯曲『生田川』を書き、1910年（明治43年）5月28日・29日、自由劇場の小山内薫・二代目市川左團次らによって有楽座で上演された。

その他
川端康成の『たんぽぽ』では、「生田町」「生田病院」「生田川」が舞台地となり、この伝説との関わりを指摘され、三島由紀夫の『獣の戯れ』では、三角関係の共同生活に、『求塚』では死後として描かれる「火宅」が暗示されるなど、小説のモチーフに影響を与えている。

旧跡
神戸市東灘区御影塚町にある処女塚は、娘「菟原処女」の墓、付近にある西求女塚（灘区都通に所在）と東求女塚（東灘区住吉宮町に所在）は2人の求婚者の墓と伝えられる。しかし実際の築造時期はそれぞれ異なっており、発掘調査によって、いずれも三世紀後半から四世紀後半にかけて作られた古墳であり、伝説のように菟原処女と二人の荘子の死を受けて同時に築かれたものではない。しかし万葉集の時代にはこれらの古墳群は海岸沿いにあったことを考えればこの伝説が海から見た古墳の景から生まれたという説がある程度の説得力を持つのではないかと大谷歩は論じている。

本項では温羅の解説とともに、温羅と吉備津彦命に関する「温羅伝説」についても解説する。

概要
温羅とは伝承上の鬼・人物で、古代吉備地方の統治者であったとされる。「鬼神」「吉備冠者（きびのかじゃ）」という異称があり、伝承によると吉備には吉備津彦命（きびつひこのみこと）が派遣され退治されたという。
伝承は遅くとも室町時代末期には現在の形で成立したものと見られ、文書には数種類の縁起が伝えられている。また、この鬼退治伝説は桃太郎伝説の原型に当たるとの説もある。

内容
伝承によると、吉備の人々は都へ出向いて窮状を訴えたが、温羅はヤマト王権が派遣した武将から逃げおおせて倒せなかった。このため崇神天皇（第10代）は孝霊天皇（第7代）の子で四道将軍の1人の五十狭芹彦命を派遣した。
討伐に際し、五十狭芹彦命は現在の吉備津神社の地に本陣を構えた。温羅に対して矢を1本ずつ射たが温羅はその都度石を投げて撃ち落とした。そこで命が2本同時に射たところ、1本は撃ち落とされたが、もう1本は温羅の左眼を射抜いた。すると温羅は雉に化けて逃げたので、五十狭芹彦命は鷹に化けて追った。さらに温羅は鯉に身を変えて逃げたので、五十狭芹彦命は鵜に変化してついに捕らえたところ温羅は降参し「吉備冠者」の名を五十狭芹彦命に献上した。これにより五十狭芹彦命は吉備津彦命と呼ばれるようになった。
討たれた温羅の首はさらされることになったが、討たれてなお首には生気があり、時折目を見開いてはうなり声を上げた。気味悪く思った人々は吉備津彦命に相談し、吉備津彦命は犬飼武命に命じて犬に首を食わせて骨としたが、静まることはなかった。次に吉備津彦命は吉備津宮の釜殿の竈の地中深くに骨を埋めたが、13年間うなり声は止まず、周辺に鳴り響いた。ある日、吉備津彦命の夢の中に温羅が現れ、温羅の妻の阿曽媛に釜殿の神饌を炊かせるよう告げた。このことを人々に伝えて神事を執り行うと、うなり声は鎮まった。その後、温羅は吉凶を占う存在となったという（吉備津神社の鳴釜神事）。この釜殿の精霊のことを「丑寅みさき」と呼ぶ。

考証
伝承では、温羅は討伐される側の人物として記述される。一方で、製鉄技術をもたらして吉備を繁栄させた渡来人であるとする見方、鉄文化を象徴する人物とする見方もある。吉備は「真金（まかね）吹く吉備」という言葉にも見えるように古くから鉄の産地として知られており、阿曽媛の出身地の阿曽郷（鬼ノ城東麓）には製鉄遺跡も見つかっている。また、鬼ノ城から流れる血吸川の赤さは、鉄分によるものともいわれる。
また、吉備津神社の本来の祭神を温羅であると見る説もある。この中で、ヤマト王権に吉備が服属する以前の同社には吉備の祖神、すなわち温羅が祀られていたとし、服属により祭神が入れ替わったと推察されている。

概要
現代において、日本で広く普及する浦島太郎の御伽話は、明治から昭和にかけて読まれた国定教科書版に近い内容である。これは童話作家の巖谷小波が1896年に発表した『日本昔噺』版に、生徒向けに手を加えて短縮したもので、玉手箱を開けて老人化してしまうことで約束を破ると悪いことが起こると伝えようとしたためである。
上代の原話では「浦島子」（浦島子伝説）で、万葉、日本書紀、丹後国風土記に記述がある。異界は龍宮でなく蓬山（蓬萊山）・常世（とこよ）の併称で呼ばれる。
現代版にみられる「竜宮」「乙姫」「玉手箱」などの呼称や、浦島が亀を買いとって助ける設定は、中世の御伽草子に由来するが、版本として知名度が高い御伽文庫版のそれではなく、異本（I類系）に見られる。浦島子伝説では、「蓬萊（とこよのくに）」の名のない女性が「玉匣（たまくしげ）」を渡す。しかし海上の竜宮図を使いながら、文章では海底であるとする江戸時代の戯作（1782年）や、また赤本絵本の模写絵だが、文章では海底とする英訳（1886年）もある
現代版にいたると亀と姫は同一でなくなるが、浦島子伝説・御伽草子では、浦島が釣って逃がした亀は乙姫（蓬莱の女性）の化身である。御伽文庫では、最後に浦島も死ぬ代わりに鶴に変身する。

普及版
現在一般的に普及しているストーリーは、教科書を通じて広く国民に知れわたったもので、概ね以下のような内容である。

浦島太郎という人（あるいは漁師）は、浜で子供達が亀をいじめているところに遭遇。その亀を買いとって保護し、海に放してやる（太郎は子供達をわざとつついて「お前たちは亀に同じことをしたんだぞ？」と叱る場合もある。）。2、3日後、亀が現れ、礼として太郎を背に乗せ、海中の竜宮に連れて行く。竜宮では乙姫が太郎を歓待。しばらくして太郎が帰る意思を伝えると、乙姫は「決して蓋を開けてはならない」としつつ玉手箱を渡す。太郎が亀に乗って元の浜に帰ると、地上では700年もの年月が経過していて、太郎が知っている人は誰一人いない。太郎が忠告を忘れて玉手箱を開けると、中から白い煙が発生し、太郎は実年齢の白髪で皺だらけの老人の姿に変化する。（尋常小学国語読本、巻3）。
経緯
上のあらすじは、特に広く親しまれた教科書だと評価される第3期国定教科書第3巻「うらしま太郎」から取った。この教科書は別名『尋常小学国語読本』、通称『ハナハト読本』という。大正～昭和の1918-1932年に使用された。
明治時代には、その元となった第2期国定教科書所収「ウラシマノハナシ」が登場している。このいわゆる「国民童話」版は、明治政府が教科書向きに書き換えたものであるが、童話作家の巌谷小波著『日本昔噺』所収の「浦島太郎」に若干の手を加えて短縮したものだと目されている。
竜宮城に行ってからの浦島太郎の行状は、子供に伝えるにふさわしくない「結婚生活」の内容が含まれているので、童話においてはこの部分は改変（もしくは省略）された。
いじめていた子供達の態度も、映像作品や出版社によって異なる（太郎に叱られて蜘蛛の子を散らすように逃げ去る、亀に進んで謝罪したうえで優しく海に放すなど）。

唱歌
文部省唱歌「浦島太郎」には、次の二つがある。

1900年の『幼年唱歌』に掲載された「うらしまたろう」（作詞・石原和三郎、作曲・田村虎蔵）
1911年の『尋常小学唱歌』（第二学年第10曲）に掲載された「浦島太郎」（作詞・乙骨三郎、作曲者不明）

変遷
浦島説話は、おおまかに古代（上代～鎌倉時代）、中世（絵巻、奈良絵本、御伽草紙）、近代の系統に分類される。
古代においては「浦島子」が、亀に身をやつした異郷の姫に出会い、夫婦になる縁といわれ、異郷にいざなわれる展開である。""神女のおしかけ女房的な話""などと形容される。異郷で3年暮らして望郷の念にかられるが、陸の世界に戻ると300年がたっており、開けるなと禁じられた箱を開けると体が消滅してしまうというのは、ほぼ近代版どおりである。
名称は時代によってことなり、異郷は蓬山・常世（→竜宮城）、人物は浦島子（→浦島）、亀比女（→乙姫）、箱は玉匣（→玉手箱）のように変遷する。
亀を漁師の浦島が助けてやるという発端は、中世（御伽草紙）にくわわるが、亀はすなわち竜宮の姫のままであり、自分が救われた理由で夫婦になる。動物報恩譚の様相をとるともされる。
古代・中世とも浦島と姫は船で異郷にたどりつく。しかし江戸時代、浦島が亀の上に乗って竜宮に行き来するのが図像化される。その嚆矢は17世紀末（元禄時代）頃とも18世紀半ばともされる。亀に乗る浦島図は、多くの草双紙などに描かれようになったが、相変わらず竜宮が波上に描かれるのも一般的であった。明治の赤本絵本（1880年代）や月岡芳年の「漫画」（1886年）では、海上の楼閣に見えるが、詳述がない。
既述の比較論文では、近代版の標準テキストとしては大正期の絵本と、昭和期の教科書（読本）であり、これらでは竜宮ははっきりと海中にもぐって到達する場所とされる。
近代版における、乗物と化した亀はもはや姫の化身ではなくなり、亀は姫の""眷族""と呼ばれる。姫その下僕を救われた恩返しに、蛸や魚などの踊り子にも命じて、浦島をもてなすが、夫婦にはならない。助けられた亀についても、報恩譚が成立するといえなくもないが、単に交通手段として浦島を送り迎えするだけの恩返しにとどまるのである。

その他の近代版
明治期の赤本
明治期の近代赤本として『浦嶋物がたり』（明治13/1880年）、『浦島弌代記』（一代記）」（1883年）、『浦島物がたり』」（1885年）が挙げられる。

明治・大正期の活版本
『田村将軍一代記・小野篁一代記・浦島太郎一代記』（銀花堂、明治22/1889年）は活版印刷されており、この明治20年代頃が木版本から活版本への過渡期とみなされる
また森林太郎（森鷗外）ら四名の編纂による『標準於伽文庫』（大正9/1920-1921年）があり、近代版の代表例のひとつとして某論文でつかわれる。

関敬吾撰
関敬吾編『日本の昔ばなし』（岩波文庫）に所収される、香川県仲多度郡で採集された話がある。これは「北前の大浦」を舞台とする。漁師の浦島太郎は、いかだ船で釣りに出かけるが亀が何度もかかるばかりで、その都度放してやる。釣果はなしに帰途につくと、渡海舟がやってきて、乙姫のいる海中の竜宮界に連れて行かれる。結末は御伽草子と同様だが、玉手箱が三段重ねで、一段目には鶴の羽があり、二段目で白煙があがって老人となり、三段目に鏡が出て浦島太郎が自分の変わり果てようを目にすると、鶴の羽が触れて鳥の姿になって飛び回る。その浦島をみようと、乙姫が亀に変身して浜にあがってくる。この話は英訳もされている。

英訳
明治期にはいくつかの英訳やドイツ訳がなされている。
バジル・ホール・チェンバレン英訳The Fisher-Boy Urashima（1886年）は、『日本昔噺』（ちりめん本）シリーズの一篇として長谷川武次郎により刊行された（挿絵は無銘だが小林永濯の作とされる）。チェンバレン訳は、記紀・丹後国風土記・万葉集など古典の設定を取り入れた混成話であり、龍宮は海中でなく海を遠く隔た離島にあるとし、二人して船を漕いで到達する設定になっている。
1897年にはラフカディオ・ハーンの「夏の日の夢」（『東の国から Out of the East』所収）によっても紹介されている。

考察
近代版の浦島太郎には、善行を行えば報われるという、「仏教的な因果応報思想」が意図的に盛り込まれるとの解説がある。近代版には、亀が「おれいに竜宮へおつれしましょう」と語っているので、報恩の意志ははっきりしている。
しかし、近代版では理不尽にも浦島の結末は短く竜宮で楽しんだ後は老人となってしまう。結果的に自身が不幸に陥ることになるので、報恩といえるかどうか、疑問視もされ、「アンチ報恩譚」とのレッテルを張る論文すらある。お伽噺として理不尽で不合理な教訓をもたらすことになっているのではないかというものだ。また古い浦島子伝説では報恩の要素は見いだせないとされる。
中世（『御伽草子』、後述）の場合は、主人公が単に老化してあるいは死んで終わるのではなく、鶴と化して「めでたき」結末となっているので、より報恩譚として成立する。これについては逆に、亀の放生を行った程度で容易に無限の宝を得られるでは釣り合わない、との批判がみられる。鶴になる結末は何を伝えたいのかわからないとの向きもある。もっとも鶴と亀は長寿の象徴でもあるので、短命の人間から姿が変じたことは吉兆である可能性もある。
精神分析学の岸田秀は、浦島が亀に乗って入る、時の流れのない楽園である竜宮城を、抑圧も欲望の不満もない子宮のメタファーとし、軽率に竜宮城を出た浦島が玉手箱を開けることで時間の中に組み込まれる物語は、性的欲望に仮託した子宮復帰願望の物語であり、何の不安もなかった幼い日々を失った嘆きの物語と解釈した。

竜宮
常世の女性が、ワタツミ（海神）の娘だということが付記されるのは、『万葉集』の長歌に詠まれる浦島子伝説においてである。
このワタツミを竜神や竜王と同一視できるかについては、浦島子伝説は既に中国の唐代に流行していた竜生九子伝説の影響を受けていたもので、すなわち奈良時代の浦島子伝説でも、亀姫は竜王の姫だったという解釈がある。また唐の『竜女伝』を元の素材として、亀姫は東海竜王の娘の竜女であるとする、より具体性のある見解を藤沢衛彦は打ち出している。
しかし仮説になりたった解釈を抜きにすれば、『御伽草子』において初めて、異郷が明確に「竜宮」となり、その異郷の女性が「乙姫」という名の竜王の娘として登場する。この竜王が竜族かを問えば、柳田国男によれば「日本の昔話の竜宮には竜はいない」とされる。

御伽草子
「浦島太郎」として伝わる話の型が定まったのは、室町時代に成立した短編物語『御伽草子』による。その後は良く知られた昔話として様々な媒体で流通することになる。亀の恩返し（報恩）と言うモチーフを取るようになったのも『御伽草子』以降のことで、乙姫、竜宮城、玉手箱が登場するのも中世であり、『御伽草子』の出現は浦島物語にとって大きな変換点であった。
「御伽草子」の稿本といえば、普通「御伽文庫」版を指すことが慣習的となっている。こちらは江戸時代に版本にされて多くの部数が普及したからである。

御伽文庫
御伽文庫の稿本の原文は、「昔丹後の國に浦島といふもの侍りしに、其の子に浦島太郎と申して、年のよはひ二十四五の男ありけり」と始まる。

丹後の国に浦島という者がおり、その息子で、浦島太郎という、年の頃24、5の男がいた。太郎は漁師をして両親を養っていたが、ある日「ゑじまが磯」というところで亀を釣りあげ、「亀は万年と言うのにここで殺してしまうのはかわいそうだ。恩を忘れるなよ」と逃がしてやった。数日後、一人の女人が舟で浜に辿り着き、漂着したと称して、なんとか本国に連れ帰してくれと請願する。実はこれは逃がしてもらった亀の化身であった。二人が舟で龍宮城に到着すると、女性は太郎と夫婦になろうと言い出す。龍宮城は、東西南北の戸を開けると四季の草木と眺めがみえるように作られていた。ここで共に三年暮す頃、太郎は残してきた両親が心配になり帰りたいと申し出た。姫は自分が助けられた亀であったことを明かし、開けることを禁じたうえで「かたみの筥（はこ）」（または「箱」、挿入歌では「玉手箱あけて悔しき」と詠まれる）を手渡した。太郎は元の浜に着き、老人に浦島（太郎の父）の行方を尋ねるが、それは七百年も昔の人で、近くにある古い塚がその墓だと教えられる。龍宮城の三年の間に、地上では七百年もの年月が経っていたのであった。絶望した太郎が箱を開けると、三筋の紫の雲が立ち昇り、太郎はたちまち老人になった。太郎は鶴になり蓬萊山へ向かって飛び去った。同時に乙姫も亀になって蓬莱山へ向かった。丹後では太郎と乙姫は夫婦の明神となって祀られた。
一説に、ここから「亀は万年の齢を経、鶴は千代をや重ぬらん」と謡う能楽『鶴亀』などに受け継がれ、さらに、鶴亀を縁起物とする習俗がひろがったとする。
『御伽草子』では竜宮城は海中ではなく、島か大陸にあるように描写され、絵巻や絵本の挿絵もそうなっている。春の庭、夏の庭、秋の庭、冬の庭の話はメインストーリーの付け足し程度に書かれている。

異本と系統
浦島太郎の御伽草子の諸本は、実際には50種以上存在する。それらをテキストの類似性で分類すると、おおよそ4つの系統に分かれる。御伽文庫は、IV類系統に該当する。

近代版に近い系統
「御伽文庫」版は御伽草子の定番だが、現代の「浦島太郎」のおとぎ話とは、筋書きや名称のうえで違いが多い。御伽文庫では、太郎は亀を買いとることはせず、背中にも乗らない。
I類系統の本が、現代版により近く、浦島太郎が宝を渡して亀を買い取る要素が含まれている。また、相手の女性を無名とせず、「乙姫」（「亀の乙姫」）と特定するものが含まれる。また本文でも「玉手箱」という言葉が使われる。
オックスフォード大学ボドリアン図書館所蔵の絵巻もI類に所属する。
林晃平は、I類を性格づける要素として、1) 亀の買い取り 2) 迎えの舟 3) 四季の間に郷愁をなだめる効果、4) 村人が長寿を認めて荼毘に付す（修行僧の役割）、5) 玉手箱の煙が蓬莱に到達し、乙姫が悲しむ、の五つを挙げている。

浦島子伝説
「浦島太郎」という名前は中世の物語から登場し、それ以前の文献では「浦島子」の伝説として記録される。この浦島子にはモデルが実在しており、複数の史書にその名が見える。浦島子は日下部首の先祖であるとされる。
浦島子の伝説は、上代の文献である『丹後国風土記逸文』『日本書紀』や『万葉集』巻九にあり、成立年代は近いとされるが、順序については異説がある。
浦島子が誘われる場所は蓬萊（とこよのくに）なので、これら伝説は異郷淹留譚（仙境淹留譚）に分類される。
蓬萊山は、中国における不老不死の理想郷で、道教の中核にある神仙思想の産物である。浦島子伝説には、こうした神仙思想的（道教的）要素が見いだせる。ただそのことについては、現地の伝説を取材したが原作者の漢籍癖が出たためとも、唐伝来の話の翻案であるから、とも論じられる。

丹後国風土記逸文
8世紀に成立した『丹後国風土記』（現在は逸文のみが残存）にある「筒川嶼子」「水江浦嶼子」は、浦島太郎の物語の原型と解されている。ほぼ同時代の『日本書紀』『万葉集』にも記述が見られるが、『丹後国風土記』逸文が内容的に一番詳しい。
内容は次の通り：

冒頭は「與謝郡日置里、この里に筒川村あり」とし、その村の筒川嶼子（つつかわのしまこ）は、容姿と風流が際立ち、別名「水江浦嶼子」といい、日下部首（くさかべのおびと）の先祖だとしている。
長谷（はつせ）の朝倉宮の御世、つまり雄略天皇の時代。嶼子（島子）が一人船で海に出るが、3日間魚は釣れず、五色の亀が取れる。船で寝入る間に亀は美女の姿に変わっている。いきなり現れた女性の素性を訪ねると、「天上の仙(ひじり)の家」の者だとの返答。島子と語らいたくなってやって来たという。舟を漕いで女性の住む「蓬山」を訪れるが、海上の島であった。門に立つと、7人の童子、ついで8人の童子に「亀比売（かめひめ）の夫がいらした」と出迎えられるが、これらは昴七星と畢星の星団であった。浦島は饗宴を受け、女性と男女の契りを交わす。
三年がたち、島子に里心がつくと、女性は悲しむが、彼女との再会を望むなら決して開けてはならない玉匣（たまくしげ）（箱）を授けて送りだす。郷里を訪ねると家族の消息は得られず、水江の浦の島子という人が300年前に失踪したと伝わる、と教えられる。約束を忘れて箱を開けると、何か美しい姿が雲をともない天上に飛び去って行った。そこで島子は女性と再会できなくなったことを悟るのである。
しかし、何らかの力で二人は歌を詠みかわすことができ、3首が万葉仮名で引用されている。後世より贈られたという2首も引かれているが、これら贈答歌は、『丹後国風土記』より後の時代に追加されたとの説がある。

伊余部馬養の作という説
『丹後国風土記』逸文は、収録された話は、連（むらじ）の伊豫部馬養（いよべのうまかい）という人物が書いた記録と突き合わせても差異がなかったとしている。すなわち馬養が丹波の国宰だった頃の文章は風土記以前に成立しており、馬養が浦島伝説の最初の筆者であるとの説がある。
馬養は7世紀後半の学者官僚で『律令』選定、史書編纂に係わって皇太子学士を勤め、『懐風藻』に神仙思想を基にした漢詩を残す当代一級の知識人であった。そのことを踏まえても、馬養の著作の源が日本の伝承だったのか、中国の説話なのか疑問が残る。現地に元々あった伝承を採集しそれを中国の神仙譚風に編集、脚色したという見解と、中国の類話の舞台を丹波/丹後に移して翻案した作品との見解とで対立している。

三浦の解釈
三浦佑之の論旨に従えば、『丹後国風土記』を基にして解釈すれば、主人公は風流な男である浦島子と、神仙世界の美女であり、その二人の恋が官能的に描かれて異界（蓬莱山）と人間界との3年対300年という時間観念を鮮明に持つ。その語り口は、古代にあっては非常に真新しい思想と表現であり、神婚神話や海幸山幸神話などとはまったく異質であり、結末が老や死ではなく肉体が地上から消え去るという神仙的な尸解譚になっているのもそのためである。

日本書紀
浦島太郎（浦嶋子）の記述は、『日本書紀』「雄略紀」の雄略天皇22年（478年）秋7月の条に見える。こちらは事件の日付だとして具体的な年・月付で記されるわけで、次のような内容である:

丹波国餘社郡（現・京都府与謝郡）の住人である浦嶋子は舟に乗って釣りに出たが、捕らえたのは大亀だった。するとこの大亀はたちまち女人に化け、浦嶋子は女人亀に感じるところあってこれを妻としてしまう。そして二人は海中に入って蓬萊山（とこよのくに）へ赴き、遍歴して仙人たち(仙衆（ひじり）)に会ってまわった。

万葉集巻九
8世紀半ば以降に成立した『万葉集』巻九の高橋虫麻呂作の長歌（歌番号1740）に「詠水江浦嶋子一首」として、浦島太郎の原型というべき以下の内容が歌われている。「春日之 霞時尓 墨吉之 岸尓出居而（春の日の 霞める時に 住吉の[""すみのえ""の] 岸に出で居て）..」という読み手の現実に始まり、そこから連想される浦島の故事に触れる。大意は次のようなものである：

水の江の浦島の子が7日も帰らず鯛や鰹を釣りをしていると、海境（うなさか）を超えて漕いでいて行き交った海神（わたつみ）の娘と語り合うようになり、そして結婚する。常世にある海神の宮で暮らすこととなったが、愚かな男は里帰りを言い出す。妻は、この常世の国に戻りたいと願うなら決してこれを開くなと、篋（くしげ）を手渡す。
水江に帰ってみると、家を出てから3年しかたっていないと思っていたのにその家は跡形も無い。箱を開ければ元の家などが戻ると思い開けたところ白い雲がたなびいて常世にむかい、うろたえて叫び、地団太を踏むと、気絶した。浦島の子は皺だらけの白髪の老人の様になり、ついには息絶えてしまった。
詠み手が長歌で「水江の浦島子の家」の跡が見えると締めくくっている。その舞台の「墨吉」は「すみのえ」と仮名振りされており、従来は丹後地方の網野町に比定されていたが、武田祐吉が摂津国住吉郡墨江村であると提唱した。澤瀉久孝『萬葉集注繹』では、虫麻呂はおそらく摂津の住吉にいたのだろうが、浦島伝説の舞台をここに移し変えて「創作」したのだとしている。
異郷淹留の場所がワタツミの神の国となり、仙女がその海神の娘になっているのは、この萬葉歌での加筆部分であるが、これもおそらく虫麻呂の創作であろうと考えられている。

平安以降
平安時代以降も漢文伝として書き継がれてきた：

10世紀初頭：『続浦島子伝記』
11世紀後半：「浦島子伝」（『本朝神仙伝』 所収）
11世紀末：「浦島子伝」（『扶桑略記』 所収）
13世紀初期：「浦島子伝」（『古事談』 所収） など。
12世紀以降になると、『俊頼髄脳』をはじめ『奥儀抄』、『和歌童蒙抄』など歌論書に浦島物語が仮名書きで写され、宮廷や貴族達の、より幅広い層に浦島物語が広く浸透した。
中世になると、『御伽草子』の「浦島太郎」をはじめ絵巻・能・狂言の題材になり、読者・観客を得て大衆化していき、江戸時代に受け継がれた。

地域伝承
長崎県壱岐に伝わる話
長崎県壱岐郡にあった郷ノ浦町（ごうのうらちょう）の華光寺にある古い書には、渡良半島の嫦娥島（じょうがじま）を竜宮城と記してある。

神奈川県横浜市神奈川区に伝わる話
神奈川県にある通称「浦島寺」と結びつく伝説は次のようなものである：

昔、相模国三浦に浦島太夫とよばれる人がおり、彼は仕事のため丹後国に赴任していた。その息子である太郎は、亀が浜辺で子供達にいじめられているところに出会う。（全国版と同じなので中略）竜宮の乙姫から授かった玉手箱と観音像を持って太郎が丹後に帰ると、そこに両親のゆかりの跡はなく、太郎は両親の墓は武蔵国白幡（現・横浜市神奈川区の東部）にあると聞かされる。
老人となった太郎は、白幡の峰に行き、両親の墓を探したが、なかなか見つけられない。それを見かねた乙姫は、松枝に明かりを照らして場所を示した。やっとのことで墓を見つけた太郎はその地に庵を結び、観音像を安置した。太郎の死後、その庵は観福寺（浦島院観福寿寺）となった。
観福寺は、江戸末期の神奈川宿火災で焼失して廃寺となるが、明治5年（1872年）に石井直方（神奈川本陣）が、神奈川区の慶運寺に一宇を増築させて併合させた。聖観世音菩薩像は残り、こちらに安置されている。この聖観世音菩薩像と、慶運寺および同区内の蓮法寺が所有する塔・碑は、「浦島太郎伝説関係資料」として横浜市登録の地域有形民俗文化財となっている。

長野県木曽の浦島伝説
長野県木曽の山中に、浦島太郎がここに住んでいたという伝説が、室町後期から江戸時代の頃に成立している。
創作であるが、古浄瑠璃『浦嶋太郎』では、舞台を上松の宿場の界隈として、浦島太郎の民話を作り変えている。すなわち信濃国に住む子宝に恵まれない夫婦が戸隠明神に祈願して授かったのが主人公の浦嶋太郎とする。その相手も、もとは「うんのの将監」の娘の「玉より姫」で、浦嶋と恋仲になるが現世では添い遂げられず、伊奈川（木曽川の支流）に身投げするが、超自然的な女性に生まれ変わる。彼女は亀に案内され、竜宮界の館のきんなら王に仕える「とうなんくわ女」となるのである。拝領した「うろこの衣」は、これを脱げば亀の姿から人間に戻るという霊物だった。姫は亀の姿となって伊奈川にいるところを浦嶋太郎に釣られ、再会を果たす。浦島は姫の船に乗り、竜宮へ案内される。

伝説がまとめられた経緯
詫間町荘内半島における浦島太郎伝説は諸大龍王の墓碑建立1847年（弘化4年）より前からあったとされる。荘内半島各地の地名が浦島伝説に由来するのではないかと詫間町出身の彫刻家新田藤太郎が提案し、郷土史家の三倉重太郎が半島各地の地名と伝説の関連性を調査し、物語として昭和23年にまとめた。

日向の海彦・山彦神話
日向（宮崎県）には記紀以来、「海幸彦と山幸彦」の神話が伝わり、これが浦島太郎もモデルになっているといわれる。

南薩地域に伝わる話
九州・薩摩半島南端の指宿市を中心とした南薩地域にも浦島伝説が伝わっており、市内長崎鼻には龍宮神社があり、指宿市が観光に利用しているだけではなく、九州旅客鉄道も「指宿のたまて箱列車」（鹿児島中央駅・指宿駅間）を運営している。南薩地域の浦島伝説で興味あるのは、鹿児島県が用意した観光客用パンフレットには「海彦と山彦」の伝説が載っており、この伝説から浦島太郎伝説への影響がありとしていて、また山彦が訪れた龍宮は琉球であるともしていて、この地域と沖縄との強い結びつきが感じられる。

沖縄に伝わる話
沖縄の伝承としては、『遺老説伝』の第103話「与那覇村の人竜宮に遊ぶこと」と浦島伝説との類似性が指摘される。粗筋は次のようなものである。

「南風原（はえばる）の与那覇村（よなはむら）の男が、与那久浜（よなくばま）で髢（かもじ。髪の毛）を拾う。探しているそぶりの美女に返すと感謝され、竜宮に招待したいと言われる。男が（手を）引かれて歩くと海が二つに割れて道が開け、竜宮に通じていた。その美女は神であり、男と竜宮で歓待の日々を過ごすことになる。三ヵ月ほど経つと男は故郷が恋しくなり帰郷を思い立つ。神女は、元の世を去ってからすでに三十三代経っており、男には子孫もいないと諭すが、断念させられない。そこで向かう所に道が開けるという（しかし絶対に開けてはいけない）紙包みを渡し里帰りさせる。男が郷里に帰り着くと辺りは変わり果て、自宅を指さし家族について尋ねるが、嘲笑され癩人扱いされる。なすすべなくなった男は丘に登り桑の杖を突きたてて穏作根（坐って休み）。ふと、何か良策が出るかと思って紙包みを開いたが、中に入っているのは白髪だけで、それが飛びついて体に付着すると、老爺と化し動けなくなって死んだ。地元の者が老爺をその場所に神として祀ったのが、穏作根嶽（うさんにだき）であるという。
この説話の主人公は無名だが、設定はおおむね浦島子伝説と合致する。本土のものと道具立てが異なり、玉匣（たまくしげ）は開けてはならぬ紙包みに置き変わり、その包みのなかの白髪が接触することで老化現象がおこる。
また、桑の木は、杖から生えてくるまで島には伝来していなかったとするので、神の国か伐られたものと推察できる。異話では、竜宮まで戻る道を開ける手段は、（紙包とは別に与えられた）桑の木の杖を海に投じることであった。
同系の話の分布としては、宮古島などにも伝わっている。柳田國男は、「竜宮」と南の島々のニルヤ（ニライカナイ）は同源だとみている。
『遺老説伝』にはまた、竜宮譚ではないが類似する第42話、善縄大屋子（よしなわうふやこ）の話が所収される。主人公は、出現した女性の言われるままに大亀を家に運ぶが咬まれて大怪我を負い、埋葬される。しかし実際は死して死なざる存在となったという展開である。

概要
後記の『豊府紀聞』など古記録に収められた伝説や昔話を基にすると、瓜生島は別府湾の九州本土（現在の大分市）から400-500メートル沖、大分川の現河口付近にあり、島の周囲は約12キロメートル、人口約5,000人だったと推定される。島の 蛭子（えびす）神社にあった 蛭子像の顔を不心得者が赤く塗った祟りで、島が沈んだとされる。幕末に阿部淡斎が編纂した『雉城雑誌』は別名を「沖の浜」といい、全国から船が出入りする約1000軒もあった港町で、寺社や島津勝久の居館が並んでいたと記す。同じく幕末に書かれた『豊陽古事談』には瓜生島と、その北にあったとされる久光島などが別府湾を覆い尽くすように存在していたとする地図を載せている。
瓜生島という名称が最初に使われたと言われるのが、1699年の戸倉貞則『豊府聞書』である。同書及びその写本または異本とされる『豊府紀聞』によれば、瓜生島は1596年9月4日（文禄5年閏7月12日）の地震（慶長豊後地震）によって沈んだとされている。この地震については、ルイス・フロイスが、「九州にある太閤の海港が地震によって被害を受けた」と言及している。この地震が実際に起きたことは 現在までの研究で判明しており、震源地は別府湾南東部で、マグニチュード7.0程度と推測されている。
沖の浜については、寛永13年（1636年）頃に成立したとみられる『徒然草嫌（もどき）評判』に、南海にあった沈島「万里が瀬」の記述に続いて「日本にも秀吉公いまだ御存生なるうちに、豊後沖の浜といへる海津、にはかに沈海と成て数百人死ける。遥なる岡に有ける楠の大木、沖に成て、近年まで潮の干ける時には木末見えし」という記述がある。
現在、大分市勢家町には「瓜生山威徳寺」という寺院が存在するが、『豊後国志』によればこの寺院は大友氏19代当主大友義長の弟、大友義正が永正10年（1513年）に瓜生島に開いたもので、沈没後に現在地に再建されたものと伝えられる。
実在したかどうかについては諸説あり、島があったとされる場所は湾の最深位置であるとして存在を否定する説、島ではなく半島だったのではないかとする説、別府市または大分市にあたる位置にあった村だったとする説など、大分川河口沖の海底に残る地すべり跡から土砂が堆積してできた島が地震による液状化と津波、その後の浸食で消失したとする説など、研究者によって見解が分かれている。また、村だったとする説のひとつとして、実在した沖の浜という港町が地震で海没し、後世に瓜生島という別名が付けられたとする説もある。
別府湾内には、瓜生島の隣に久光島という島があって、瓜生島と同時または2年後に沈んだとされる。このほか日本国内では、高麗島（長崎県五島列島）や万里ヶ島（鹿児島県甑島列島）に関して、瓜生島と類似した島の沈没伝説が残っている。
一夜にして沈んだ共通点を持つことから、日本のアトランティスと称されることもある。

概要
「島の名」としての用語の初出は、平安時代の歌人藤原公任の千載集に載せられた歌、「おぼつかなうるまの島の人なれやわが言の葉を知らず顔なる（心もとないことだ。うるまの島の人だからだろうか、わたしの贈った和歌に知らぬ顔をしているのは）」とされる。
この場合「うるまの島の人のここに放たれて来てここの人の物言ふを聞きも知らでなんあるといふ頃返事せぬ女に遣はしける（うるまの島の人が日本に漂流してきて、日本人の言葉を聞いてもわからないでいるという評判の頃に、返歌をしない女に送った歌）」と前書されてあり、ここでの「うるま」が朝鮮半島の鬱陵島（ウルルンド）であることは、すでに明治時代中期には佐々木弘綱・佐佐木信綱父子が朝鮮半島の属島と明記し、後述の古典籍の記述からも、古典文学、和歌研究者の間での定説となっている。
『大日本史』（巻234）によれば、【藤原行成の『権記』に寛弘元年（1004年）高麗人の因幡漂着が記述され、『本朝麗藻』によれば食料を与え帰国させたとあり、この漂流者は『大納言公任集』によれば新羅宇流麻島人で、『東国通鑑』では芋陵島人である（本朝麗藻では「迂陵島」）】と記述されている。日本語の通用しない相手としての「うるま」としては、同じく平安時代の『狭衣物語』にも「こはいかにとよ うるまの島の人とも覚え侍るかな（どうしたものか、言葉の通じないうるまの島の人のようにこちらの心が通じない）」と使われている。
『千載集』（1188年）に採択される前に編纂された私家版の『公任集』（1041年頃）の詞書（前書）には「しらぎのうるまの島の人」とあるものが、千載集では国名が省略されてしまったため、これが後に何処とも知れぬ辺境の異邦人の島の代名詞となり、異郷の島の呼び名となった。
なお、「うるま」の言葉自体は藤原仲文の歌、「ゆきかよひ定めがたさは旅人の心うるまのわたりなりけり」が初めとされるが、こちらは美濃の宇留間（岐阜県各務原市鵜沼）のことである
。
室町時代には、当時の琉球国が室町幕府に遣使し本土との交易を行ったころから、辺境の島としての「うるま」が沖縄を指すようになった。文献上は宗碩の連歌用語辞典『藻塩草』（1513年頃）に「宇留間島（非日本か一説をきなふを云と）」とあるのが最古である。安土桃山時代に里村紹巴が『狭衣物語』の注釈書『下紐』に「琉球をうるまの島と云と也」と書いてこれが定着したものと考えられ、江戸時代前期に成立した和歌用語辞典『和歌呉竹集』には「うるまのしま国 又うるまの国ともいふ 琉球国の事也」と明記されている。連歌用語辞書『匠材集』（1597年）では「うるまの國 りうきうなり」、「うるまのしま えそか嶋也」と沖縄と北海道が並べられ、「言葉の通じない異郷の地」の意味合いで「うるま」という名は認識されていた。
琉球側文献では、古語も多く含まれる古歌謡集『おもろさうし』（1623年）にも「うるま」の記述はない。17世紀末に識名盛命（唐名は毛起龍）が和文体の紀行文『思出草』（1700年）に薩摩と日本本土での琉球の別称として記したことから、琉球人の間でも知られるようになったが、知識人以外の一般への定着はならなかった。
もっとも、江戸時代中から「うるま」と琉球国の関係については疑問が呈されており、『古事類苑』に引用される嘉永3年（1850年）の山崎美成『琉球入貢紀略』では、『下紐』の記述からそう言われているが「うるまは新羅（今の朝鮮なり）の属島にして琉球にはあらず」「うるまは迂陵の韓音なりといへり」と断言されている。
海外においては李氏朝鮮の『海東諸国紀』（1501年）や、中国明朝・清朝の冊封使が遺した『使琉球録』各書などに当時の単語・会話文が収集されているが、それらの中でも「うるま」に該当する言及は無い。ようやく『琉球説略』（1877年）に「琉球古云宇留間島 起於日本西海道薩摩国之南百四十里海中」とあるが、すでに明治政府により日清修好条規が結ばれ、日本国内の情報も広まった段階であった。
20世紀に入り、大正時代以降に本土の文人が沖縄の美称として「うるま」と呼ぶようになったことから、沖縄県民の間にも広がるようになる。昭和10年（1935年）には明仁親王の乗馬として宮古馬が選定され、右流間（うるま）と名付けられた。戦後は煙草の銘柄としてうるまが販売され、逆に本土でも沖縄の雅称として有名となり、県民の間にも名称が定着して、ついには地方自治体としてうるま市が誕生する次第となった。
近年は「うるま」の語源は沖縄方言で「珊瑚の島」（「ウル（珊瑚）」「マ（島）」）とされるが、民間語源に過ぎない。
沖縄方言語源説は波照間島の名の由来としての「ハテウルマ」説から始まっている。笹森儀助の『南嶋探験』に「極南端ニアル波照間島ノ義ハ「ハテウルマ」の転語ニシテ古ヨリ我カ国境タルコト其名称ニ依テ明也云々右西氏ノ物語ナリ」とあり、明治26年（1893年）に西常央（長崎県出身、明治中期に八重山役所長や首里役所長）が提唱したのが端緒とされる。
「ハテウルマ」が沖縄古語であるとの前提でそのままこの説が取り入れられ、柳田国男は『海南小記』で「波照間の島はすなわちハテウルマで、うるまの島々の南の果て、の意味であろうということだ」とし、宮良當壯は『南島叢考』で「『ウル』は海石（珊瑚石）或いはその砕けた砂礫をいい『マ』は島の『マ』と同じく場所を表すのであろうと思われるから、ハテウルマは日本の端の砂礫からなる島と云う意味であろう」としていた。
現状の語源説では「ウル」は珊瑚の意味ということが独り歩きしているが、宮良が指摘するように沖縄方言での「ウル」は本来（珊瑚の砕けた）粗砂を意味し、「シマ」が「マ」に変化したという点も言語学上の変遷の根拠に欠ける。また、この「うるま沖縄方言説」は戦前より、伊波普猷、東恩納寛惇らによる本土・沖縄の古典記述を元にした論考で批判を受けていた。
現在「うるま」は沖縄の歴史と文化の独自性を表す言葉として多用されているが、結果として本土の文化との強いつながりを示すこととなった。

七不思議は様々な内容が語り継がれており、高橋克庵の『北遊紀行』では22個、『北越名所旧跡奇物名産地理案内之全図』では49個の不思議が紹介されている。中でも親鸞の伝説にかかわる7つが代表的な不思議である。越後国は親鸞の流刑地であり、浄土真宗が盛んであったため、動植物の珍種を親鸞の起こした奇瑞として伝えたものであると考えられている。

代表的な七不思議
逆さ竹（さかさだけ）
新潟市中央区鳥屋野の西方寺に現存する。国指定の天然記念物。
天然記念物指定名称は鳥屋野逆ダケの藪（とやのさかさだけのやぶ）。
枝が下向きに生える枝垂れタケ。親鸞が竹杖を逆さに土に挿したものに根が生えたと伝える。逆さ竹はハチクが枝垂れる変異種であるが、竹の枝垂れは他にほとんど例がなく、極めて珍しい奇形であることから1922年（大正）11年10月12日に国指定の天然記念物に指定された。近隣に所在するゆかりの寺である西方寺には、標本が保存されている。
竹が枝垂れる原因については、長期間にわたって狭い範囲に密生して生育することによる影響や、豪雪による積雪量の多い期間が長いことによる中空の竹枝の耐久性などの因果関係が議論されてきたが、未だに確定的なものはない。

焼鮒（やきふな）
新潟市西区山田の山王神社（現在の山田神社）での出来事。
1211年（建暦元年）11月、親鸞が赦免され当地を去る際に催された酒宴の肴に、焼いたフナが用意されたが、親鸞が傍らの榎に纏っていた袈裟を掛け「わが真宗の御法、仏意にかない、念仏往生間違いなくんば、この鮒必ず生き返るべし」と唱えてから池に放したところ、生き返り泳ぎだしたという。それ以来、当地では体に黒い焦げ目模様のあるフナが獲れるようになったと伝えられている。1796年（寛政8年）には親鸞が袈裟を掛けたとされる榎の枝が折れたため、その枝を挽くと切り口の一方に親鸞の姿、もう一方に鮒の形が現れた。
この2つの木の盤を山王神社の神官であった田代家で厨子にいれて安置していたが、親鸞の盤は火災で焼け焦げてしまっている。
神社近くの焼鮒駅は、この伝説にちなんで名付けられた。

八房の梅（やつふさのうめ）
阿賀野市小島の梅護寺に現存する。
ひとつの花に八つの実がなる八重咲きのウメ。親鸞が「のちの世の しるしのために 残し置く 彌陀頼む身の たよりともがな」と詠み、梅干の種を植えて育った梅であると伝えられている。
八房の梅は全国にあり、座論梅や品字梅とも呼ばれる。山梨県の洞雲寺、岐阜県の聖蓮寺にある八房の梅はそれぞれ県指定の天然記念物となっており、宮崎県児湯郡新富町の湯ノ宮の座論梅は国指定の天然記念物となっている。

珠数掛桜（じゅずかけざくら）
阿賀野市小島の梅護寺に後継樹がある。国指定の天然記念物であるが、原木は枯死している。
天然記念物指定名称は梅護寺の珠数掛ザクラ（ばいごじのじゅずかけざくら）。
サトザクラの栽培品種である。親鸞が桜の枝に数珠を掛け仏法を説いたところ、数珠のように花がつながり咲くようになったと伝えられている。また、花房が10cm以上になるという特徴もある。
梅護寺の桜の花は紅色で約80枚の花びらで構成され、八重桜の中でも特に美しいことから、昭和2年4月8日に国指定の天然記念物に指定された。
2002年に原木がならたけ病に感染し、後継樹を作るため組織培養を開始した。2006年・2007年に培養が成功した後継樹2本を含む12本が梅護寺に移植された。

三度栗（さんどぐり）
阿賀野市保田の孝順寺にあるが、当時の三度栗は枯れ、現在は新しい三度栗が植えられている。
一年に三度花が咲き、六月・九月・十一月に実を結ぶという栗。親鸞が植えた焼栗から育ったと伝えられている。

繋ぎ榧（つなぎがや）
南蒲原郡田上町大字田上丙の了玄寺に現存する。国指定の天然記念物。
天然記念物指定名称は了玄庵のツナギガヤ（りょうげんあんのつなぎがや）。
糸を通したような穴のある実がなるカヤの木である。親鸞が植えた食膳のカヤの実から育ったと伝えられている。また、親鸞が護摩堂山で法話をした際に護摩堂城主から貰い受けた、農民が年貢代わりに納めた糸でつないだ榧の実を、植えたものであるとも伝えられている。
榧の実の穴は種子が発芽する際に幼根が出る為のものだが、了玄寺の榧の実はその穴が顕著に現れるという。
了玄寺の近くには、国指定の天然記念物・田上村ツナギガヤ自生地があり、了玄庵のツナギガヤはこの自生地から移植されたものである。

片葉の芦（かたはのあし）
上越市五智の居多神社に現存する。
アシ科の植物は通常、葉が互生するのに、それが片側一方向にだけ伸びるアシ。親鸞が神社に参詣し念じたところ、池に生えるアシが一夜にして「片葉」になったと伝えられている。また、親鸞が池に映る自分自身の顔を像にしようと彫刻をしていた際の伝承も残っている。彫刻をしていたある日、心を安らげる葦笛の音が聞こえ、ふと見上げると麗しい乙女がほほえみかけてきたという。芦笛の音が何日も続き、像が完成したときすべての芦が片葉になっており、乙女により片葉が摘み取られていたという。それ以来「片葉」になったとも伝えられている。
直江津の居多ヶ浜で船を降りた親鸞が越後の地に第一歩を記した記念に、上越市国府に七不思議第1番として「片葉の葦の石碑」が立っている。
片葉の芦は全国にあり、本所七不思議のひとつの片葉の葦や遠州七不思議の妙日寺の片葉の葦がある。地形や水流などの影響で、片葉になるという。

八珍柿
八珍柿（はっちんがき）は渋柿の品種。正式名は平核無柿（ヒラタネナシガキ）。実の中に種のできないカキの変種。
越後七不思議の次に珍しい、種がない柿という意味から「八珍」とも言われている。
原木は新潟市秋葉区古田にあり、樹齢約300年、高さ16m、幹周り200cmの巨木で県指定の天然記念物になっている。明治20年頃、鶴岡市の鈴木重作が栽培していた八珍柿を庄内藩家老職の酒井調良が気に入り、栽培を広げたものが庄内柿と呼ばれるようになり、昭和初期になって佐渡郡羽茂村（のちの羽茂町、現在の佐渡市）の杉田清が佐渡島で産地化をすすめたものがおけさ柿である。

伝説
前橋市を貫流する利根川の流路は時代により変遷がある。今でこそ池にあるお艶が岩も、昔は利根川の流れの西側にあった。そんな昔、利根川の西側の村にお艶という大変美しい娘がいた。お艶が18歳のとき、対岸の村の男と恋におちた。彼女にとって初恋である。ある日お艶は、川を渡り男の住むという村を訪ねた。ところが、いくら探しても男は見つからない。ついに気が狂ったお艶は利根川に面した褐赤色の巨石の上で毎日のように男の名を呼ぶようになるが、最終的にこの岩から利根川に飛び込んで命を絶った。後のお艶が岩である。
これとは少し異なる伝説を記す文献もある。当時は橋などもなく、女性が川を渡るのは大変だろうと対岸の村の男は川を渡ってお艶に逢いに来てくれた。ところが秋風が吹くころ、男は姿を現さなくなった。お艶には川を渡る体力もなく、河原で男が来るのを待つことしかできなかったという。
また別の伝説によると、お艶は淀君の変名であるという。淀君といえば大坂夏の陣（1615年）の際自害したという説が有力であるが、捕らえられて前橋城に連れてこられたという説もある。連れてきたのは総社城主の秋元長朝。淀君は総社城で辛い日々を送る。城主は何とかして淀君を自分のものにすべく努力をするが、思うようにいかない。ついにキレた城主は淀君を蛇攻めの拷問にかけたうえこの岩の下を流れる利根川に沈めてしまった。淀君は世をはかなんでこの岩から利根の流れに身を投げたとする文献もある。以後、この岩の上に淀君の幽霊が現れるようになった。元景寺には淀君の墓とされるものが現存する。「心窓院殿華月芳永大姉」と刻まれた墓石がそれである。墓石には「泰朝の乳母」であるとも記されている。
これとは別に、お艶は淀君ではなく大阪城からもらってきたお縁という女中とする伝説もある（佐藤寅雄による）。

あらすじ
ある時、主人公が赤沼でおしどりを見つけ、これを狩る。するとその夜、夢の中で美女が現れて「なぜ夫を殺したのか」と泣きながら主人公を責める。
翌日、主人公がおしどりを狩った場所に行ってみると、雌のおしどりが主人公に向かって近づいてきて、目の前で自分の体を引き裂いて死んでしまう。主人公は出家して僧になる。

原典
同様の伝説が日本の各地に伝わる他、今昔物語集にも同様の話がみられる。
小泉八雲の「怪談」に収録されたものは陸奥国田村の郷という地名が書いてあることから、福島県郡山市中田町赤沼、あるいは秋田県横手市大雄赤沼に伝わるもののいずれかが原型と思われる。
無住の「沙石集」に収録されたものは下野国アソ沼という地名があり、栃木県宇都宮市の求喰沼（あさりぬま）または同県佐野市の安蘇沼（あそぬま）に比定する。ただしアソ沼を求喰沼と解釈するには無理があることから、宇都宮説を郷土史家は否定的に見ている。
その他、千葉県八千代市・富里市、長野県伊那市などにもほぼ同様の話が伝わる。

概要
源頼朝が千葉城に立ち寄った際に、千葉常胤がこの井戸から水を汲んでお茶を進めたら、殊の外賞味されたのでこの名があるとする説がある。また、徳川家康が鷹狩に来た際、喉を潤したとも言われる。
現在井戸は枯れているが、水道水が引かれ記念碑が建てられている。

伝説・説話
大分県
『豊後国風土記』の記述として、「玖倍利（くべり）湯の井」という名の温泉があり、不意に大声を出して何かを言うと、驚き鳴って2丈あまりわき上がった。この伝承が、最も古く、後世で多様化した。
後世、仏教と共に念仏が流行したことにより、泉に向かって僧侶が念仏をとなえるというパターンが増えたと柳田國男は指摘しており、僧侶が日本各地へ回る以前の時代では、神聖な泉を祀っていた説話とも考えている。
同国（現大分県）には、「念仏水」という小池があり、「なむあみだぶつ」ととなえると、水も応じて泡を立て、ぶつぶつとものを言った。
宮城県
岩出山の近くの「うとう坂」のそばにあった池は、「なむあみだぶつ」ととなえて手を打てば、しばらくの間、わき上がることが止んだとされる（岩出山町伝承）。
多くの場合、念仏をとなえると泉がわき出したといったパターンの説話が多いが、この話は正反対の事例となっている。
新潟県
越後国蓮華寺村の「姨（おば）が井」と呼ばれる古井戸は、そばに近寄って、大声で「おば」と呼ぶと、井戸の底から泡が浮かんできて、声に応じるようであった。疑う者が、「兄」や「妹」と呼んでも、知らぬ顔をして反応しなかった（大津村伝承）。
同国曾地峠には、「おまんが井」があり、そばにより、「おまん」と呼ぶと、水面にさざ波が起こったとされる。おまんは、この井の近くに住んでいた某（なにがし）という武士（さむらい）の女房であったが、夫に憎まれ、殺されたあげく、この井に投げ落とされた。その恨みが水中に残っているとされる（中通村伝承）。
これらは、駿河国（現静岡県）の「姥（うば）が池」と同様、身投げした霊が水中にとどまったものと考えられている。
群馬県
上野国伊勢崎近くの書上原には、「阿満が池」という小さな池があり、その岸に立って「あま」と呼ぶと、その声に応じて、下からわき上がり、「しばしば呼べば、しばしば出づ」と答えたとされる。
栃木県
下野国那須の温泉の湯本から三町ばかり離れた所に「教伝地獄」というのがあり、「教伝かいない」と大声で怒鳴ると、たちまちぐらぐらと湯がわいた。その昔、教伝という男が山へ薪取りに行く時、朝飯が遅くなり、友達が先に行くのに腹を立て、母親を踏み倒して出かけたので、その罰で魂がこんな所にいるのだとされる（那須村伝承）。
静岡県
伊豆国の熱海には、「平左衛門湯」というのがあり、「平左衛門かいない」とからかうと湯がわくとされた。
兵庫県
摂津国有馬の温泉には、人が近くへより、大声で悪口を言うと、たちまちわき上がる湯口があり、これを「後妻湯（うわなりのゆ）」と呼んでいた。また、若い娘が美しく化粧をして、そばに行っても、怒ってわき立つと評判になったため、「妬みの湯」と呼ぶ人もいた（有馬町伝承）。

その他
間欠泉の存在を知らない子に大人が銭を渡し、「○○と呼んでみろ」といった、からかいともとれる話も見られる。

人物像
『古今和歌集』序文において六歌仙の一人に挙げられており、文屋康秀や僧正遍昭、凡河内躬恒、在原業平、安倍道行、小野貞樹らと和歌の贈答を行っている。

出自
出自は明らかでないが、通説では出羽国郡司小野良真の娘とされている。ほかに、小野篁自身の娘、あるいは小野滝雄の娘とする説もある。
「小野」については地名とする説や氏姓とする説があるが、氏姓とする説が有力である。その論拠として大江朝綱「男女婚姻賦」（『本朝文粋』巻第一）に小野小町の氏姓を省略した例がみられ、このような氏姓の省略が多くの文書で見られるのに対して地名は省略しないことが挙げられる。
「小町」については、民俗学の立場から小野氏の采女がもつ世襲の霊媒職名とする説、後宮に仕える女性の通称とする説、本名であるとする説がある。この論点については勅撰集である『古今和歌集』や『後撰和歌集』にみえる小野小町の姉や孫（ただし『後撰和歌集』では伝本によって姉が従姉になったり孫が姪になったりしている）を根拠として挙げるものもある。一説には小町姉が実在するという前提で、出羽国の郡司の小野一族の娘で姉妹揃って宮仕えする際に姉は「小野町」と名付けられたのに対し、妹である小町は「年若い方の“町”」という意味で「小野小町」と名付けられたという説がある。
『続日本後紀』で承和九年正月八日に正六位上を授けられたとされる小野吉子と関連づける説もあり、小野吉子と同一人物であるとする説（角田文衛説）や小野吉子は姉の「小野の町」なる人物にあたるとする説（岡一男説）がある。この角田説や岡説では『古今和歌集』の「三条町（紀静子）」や「三国町（仁明天皇皇子貞登の母）」と「町」を同様に論じるが、両者は地名に由来すると考えられ氏姓名の小野小町とは同様には論じられないとする異論もある。
一方、勅撰集の作者表記の例や、先述の勅撰集の姉や孫の表記（「小町が姉」や「小町が孫」）のような例では前部に実名がくる（「～が母」の場合には前部に実名がくる）ことから「小町」は本名であるとする説がある。

生誕地に纏わる伝承
秋田県湯沢市小野とする説 - 誕生の地として桐木田の井戸が残り、後世に菅江真澄が小町伝説の聞き取りを行っている。
福島県小野町とする説 - 小野篁と愛子（めずらこ、珍敷御前）の娘の比古姫が小野小町であるとする伝承がある。
神奈川県厚木市小野とする説。
千葉県東金市小野 - 地元の貴船神社の「貴船大明神縁起」に小町の名がある。
滋賀県彦根市小野町とする説 - 小野美実（好美）が出羽に赴任する際に小野宿で宿泊した際、生後間もない女児を養女に迎えたという伝承がある。
福井県越前市とする説
熊本県熊本市北区植木町小野とする説

晩年に纏わる伝承
前述の秋田県湯沢市小野には晩年に住んだという伝承のある岩屋堂遺跡がある。また、京都市山科区小野は小野氏の栄えた土地とされ、小町は晩年ここの随心院で過ごしたとの説がある。
なお、亡くなったとする伝承のある地に小町の墓がある例もある（茨城県新治郡新治村小野（現土浦市）など）。以下の墓所を参照。

墓所
小野小町の物とされる墓も、全国に点在している。

秋田県湯沢市小野には深草少将と小野小町の墳墓と伝わる二ツ森がある。
宮城県登米市東和町米川に『小町塚』と称する墓があり、付近には「小町桜」と呼ばれる桜の木があった他「小町峠」という地名や、小町を慕ってやってきたという某大納言の碑も残っている。

岡山県総社市清音黒田にも、小野小町の墓がある。この地の伝承としては、小町が「四方の峰流れ落ちくる五月雨の黒田の蛭祈りますらん」とよむと、当地の蛭は吸い付かなくなったという蛭封じの歌が伝えられている。
山口県下関市豊浦町川棚中小野にも、小野小町の墓がある。

世界三大美人
日本では一般にクレオパトラ、楊貴妃と共に小野小町が「世界三大美人」（または世界三大美女）の一人に数えられている。小野小町の代わりにヘレネー、楊貴妃の代わりに虞美人を加える場合もある。
明治中期、日本国内でナショナリズムが高まると、世界三大英雄（カエサル、ナポレオン、織田信長）ら日本人を世界の偉人にしようという動きが生まれ、小野小町もメディアに登場するようになったのが始まりとされている。

作品
『古今和歌集』の18首や『後撰和歌集』の4首など勅撰集に六十数首の和歌が収められている。また『小町集』が伝わる。ただし、これらの中には他人の歌や後人の偽作も含まれているともいわれる。歌風は情熱的で奔放な恋歌であり、そこから小野小町に関する多くの説話や伝説が生み出された。

次の歌からも美女であった事が窺える。これは、百人一首にも選ばれている。

小野小町にちなむ作品
小野小町を題材とした作品を総称して「小町物」という。

能
小野小町を題材にした七つの謡曲、『草紙洗小町』『通小町』『鸚鵡小町』『関寺小町』『卒都婆小町』『雨乞小町』『清水小町』の「七小町」がある。これらは和歌の名手として小野小町を讃えたり深草少将の百夜通いを題材にしたものと、年老いて乞食となった小野小町に題材にしたものに大別される。後者は能作者らによって徐々に形作られていった「衰老落魄説話」として中世社会に幅広く流布した。

歌舞伎
『積恋雪関扉』（つもるこい ゆきの せきのと） 通称「関の扉」、歌舞伎舞踊（常磐津）、天明4年 (1784) 江戸桐座初演
『去程恋重荷』（さるほどに こいのおもに）  通称「恋の重荷」、歌舞伎舞踊（常磐津）、文政2年 (1819) 江戸中村座初演

美術
鎌倉時代に描かれた、野晒しにされた美女の死体が動物に食い荒らされ、蛆虫がわき、腐敗して風化する様を描いた九相詩絵巻は別名を「小野小町九相図」と呼ばれる。モデルとしては他に檀林皇后も知られ、両人とも「我死なば焼くな埋むな野に捨てて 痩せたる（飢ゑたる）犬の腹を肥やせ（よ）」の歌の作者とされた。

裁縫用具
裁縫に使う「待ち針」の語源は小野小町にちなむという俗説がある。言い寄ってくる多くの男に小野小町がなびくことがなかったため、穴（膣）のない女と噂されたという伝説に基づき、穴のない針のことを「小町針」と呼んだことから来ているというものである。
横溝正史の推理小説『悪魔の手毬唄』に登場する手毬唄では、「穴がない女性」という意味で「小町」の語が用いられている。

舞台
『夜会』Vol.5（1993年）
中島みゆきの舞台。サブタイトルが「花の色は うつりにけりな いたづらに わが身世にふる ながめせし間に」である。ポスターには十二単を着て小野小町に扮した中島みゆきが後姿で写っている。ストーリーは小野小町の伝承と、上田秋成の雨月物語の中の浅茅が宿をモチーフにしている。
『ミュージカル小野小町』
わらび座2007年上演の舞台。内舘牧子脚本、椿千代主演）は小町が残した「我死なば 焼くな埋むな 野にさらせ 痩せたる犬の 腹を肥やせよ」の歌から、自分の人生を生ききった美しいだけではない強い女性として小町を描いている。
『小町の千年情話』

小説
『小説 小野小町「吉子の恋」』
三枝和子著。小野小町の本名が「小野吉子」で、文徳天皇の更衣だったとする説を採用して、その一生を描いている。

アニメ
『超訳百人一首 うた恋い。』
六歌仙のひとりとして3話から5話にかけて登場。声を演じたのは遠藤綾。

『君の名は。』
原作者であり監督の新海誠は、小町の古今和歌集の和歌から着想を得て、この作品をつくったとしている。

ドラマ
『京都妖怪地図』の第2作「きらら坂に住む400歳の氷女」（1981年）
小野小町と深草少将の「百夜通い」の如く、公家の裏切りに傷ついた白拍子への想いを証明しようとした面打師・孫四郎（演 - 名高達郎）は九十九夜を最後に通いは途絶えた。時は流れ、転生した孫四郎は現代の京都で低温科学研究所に勤務する青年・山村三郎（演 - 名高達郎）として幸福な結婚をするが、前世の恋人が死ぬことなく400歳の妖怪「氷女」と化して真夏の上に異常気象で酷暑に見舞われる「きらら坂」に現れて男性を次々と死なせる事件を引き起こし、「百日行」の残り一日を目前にした修行僧・日信（演 - 小林芳宏）や三郎の父・山村孝吉（演 - 芦屋小雁）も犠牲になった。京都府警の早川六助（演 - 遠藤太津朗）は捜査の過程で、記録にあるだけでも戦後から5件も同様の怪事件が起きていることを知り困惑する。更には、妻・民子（演 - 村田みゆき）も「氷女」を目撃したショックで眼が見えなくなり入院してしまう。その一方で、「氷女」の前に非業の死を遂げた日信の怨霊が出没して恨み言をぶつける。真夏の凍死事件の記事を読んだ三郎は父が恋い焦がれた着物デザイナーの九条沙織（演 - 宇津宮雅代）が人間の法律では裁けぬ妖怪だと確信して罠を仕掛け、背後から忍び寄った「氷女」にナイフを突き刺して致命傷を与えるが、彼女は三郎の前世である孫四郎の恋人であり、三郎の妻は沙織の妹の転生だった。死に際、妹を幸せにしてやって下さいと言い残し、沙織は呪われた人生の幕を閉じた。その直後、民子は眼が見えるようになる。

人物
室町時代後期成立の『尊卑分脈』の「小野氏系図」には名前があり、さらに「一本（別の本には）」と注記して「当澄」および「常澄」の別名が記される。
『尊卑分脈』に記されている官位は出羽守である。これは中世には、小町を出羽郡司の娘とする説があったが、小野篁と系譜をつなげる際に、公卿である篁の子が、郡司であるのは違和感があることからなされた改変であろう。また、小町は篁の孫にしては時代が合わない。
なお、「良真が出羽郡司として赴任中に、地元の娘との間に出来たのが小町」とする記述が、存在するが、郡司はその地の有力者が世襲的に任命されるものであり、国司との混同であろう。
良実の存在を記す『尊卑分脈』は基本、女子を記さないが、良実の娘のみを特に記す。これは、良実の存在が、小野小町を説く際に行われた歌学の伝承によるものである証拠だと思われる。

概要
井手町に伝わる伝承では、小野小町は、晩年を井提寺（円提寺）に住み、玉川堤を散策したと伝えられる。小町の墓と伝えられる塚は、玉津岡神社参道の右脇にあり、周囲を石垣で囲った土壇上の礎石の上に、ほぼ立方体をした自然石を四個積み重ねている。この塚石は、井提寺（円提寺）の礎石とも伝えられる。
1143年（康治2年）「山城国井堤郷旧地全図」（模写1326年、1803年）で、現在の場所に建立されているのが描かれている。ただし、この模写は「椿井文書」ではないかと指摘されており、定かではない。　　　
背面に「清林」と刻まれており、建碑者の法名と考えられる。

伝承
小野小町が晩年を井手町で過ごしたとされる伝承の根拠としては、9世紀後半に成立したとされる小野小町の家集『小町集』や『新後拾遺和歌集』に「色も香もなつかしきかな蛙鳴く井出のわたりの山吹の花」と詠まれていることから、井手町に小野小町が実際に訪れていたことがうかがえる。また、鎌倉時代に成立したとされる『冷泉家流伊勢物語抄』やその記述に由来する近世の『山城名勝志』『和漢三才図絵』等によると、小野小町は、晩年、井提寺（円提寺）の別当の妻になり、69歳で井提寺にて没したとされる。

概説
室町時代の御伽草子。作者、成立年不詳。藤原秀衡より、北の国の都に「かねひら大王」が住み、『大日の法』と称する兵法書があることを聞いた、頼朝挙兵以前の青年時代の御曹子義経は、蝦夷（えぞ）の千島喜見城に鬼の大王に会う事を決意する。四国土佐の湊から船出して喜見城の内裏へ向かう。途中、「馬人」（うまびと）の住む「王せん島」、裸の者ばかりの「裸島」、女ばかりが住む「女護（にようご）の島」、背丈が扇ほどの者が住む「小さ子の島」などを経めぐった後、「蝦夷が島」（北海道）に至り、内裏に赴いて大王に会う。 そこへ行くまでに様々な怪異体験をするが最後には大王の娘と結婚し、兵法書を書き写し手にいれるが天女（大王の娘）は死んでしまう。

背景
「御曹子島渡」説話は、当時渡党など蝦夷地を舞台に活躍する集団の存在や予想以上に活発だった北方海域の交易の様相が広く中央にも知られるようになった事実を反映しているものと考えられる。
江戸時代には義経北行伝説が成立するが、その原型となった説話が室町時代の御伽草子にみられる。「御曹子島渡」説話とよばれる話がそれである。治承・寿永の乱は、源平合戦であると同時に王朝国家に対する武士の組織立った抵抗ないし自立化の希求という側面を有し、この抵抗を通じて東国政権である鎌倉幕府が成立してゆく過程でもあった。その組織の頂点にあったのが征夷大将軍となった源頼朝であり、梶原景時はその良き補佐役、そして義経に付された軍監であった。ところが、義経は頼朝の名代であり、武士でありながら、頼朝の軍律には違反し、平家を倒すと云う宿願を果たした義経は法皇から戦勝を讃える勅使を受け、一ノ谷の戦い、屋島の戦いの大功を成した立役者として、平氏から取り戻した鏡璽を奉じて京都に凱旋した。
激怒した頼朝は、血の繋がった弟であるにも拘らず、義経を謀反者として討伐するよう部下に命じた。義経は立役者からお尋ね者の身に転落する。義経ら一行は東北の奥州藤原氏を頼り、秘密裏に逃亡するが、泰衡らの裏切りにより死す。
この歴史事件を、庶民は、頼朝を権力者、景時を讒言者、義経を悲劇の英雄と捉えた。このような理解のうえに、反権力という立場からの共感、讒言者への憎しみ、冷酷な兄に対する健気な弟に対する同情、あるいは「滅びの美学」とも呼ぶべき独特の美意識が加わって、「判官びいき」が生まれた。王朝国家の側に立つ畿内の文化人の多くが義経びいきだったことも、こうした風潮を後押しし、「御曹司島渡」が生まれる。
判官びいきは、早くも南北朝時代から室町時代初期に成立したと考えられる軍記物語『義経記』にあらわれている。五味文彦（日本中世史）は鎌倉時代成立の『曽我物語』が御霊信仰の影響の強い作品であるのに対し、『義経記』にはそれが希薄であることを指摘している。五味は、それを根拠に『義経記』の鎌倉時代成立説に疑義を呈し、鎌倉幕府治下において義経の活躍を描くにはいたらなかったであろうと推測している。また、南北朝時代にはいって、室町幕府創業に大きく寄与したのが足利尊氏・直義の兄弟であったことから、頼朝・義経兄弟の活動に目が向けられたのではないか、としている。
『義経記』は、能や幸若舞曲、御伽草子、浮世草子、歌舞伎、人形浄瑠璃など、後世の多くの文芸や演劇に影響を与え、今日の義経やその周辺の人間像は、この物語に準拠しているとされる。義経主従など登場人物の感情が生き生きと描かれ、人物の描写にすぐれているとされる。しかし、義経死後200年を経過してからの成立と考えられるため、『義経記』の作者は当事者たちの人柄を、直接的にも間接的にも知っていたとは考えられない。また、軍記物語の下地となりうる軍注記を利用したとも考えられていない。さらに、作中の行動のあちこちに矛盾が生じていることも指摘されており、歴史資料としてではなく物語として扱うのが妥当とされる。なお、『弁慶物語』の成立も応永から永享にかけての時期（1394年-1440年）と考えられている。
文治5年（1189年）閏4月30日に義経が藤原泰衡に襲撃され奥州衣川で自害し、藤原泰衡は、そのことを5月22日に報告し、義経の首は6月13日に鎌倉の頼朝のもとに届けられたと『吾妻鏡』には記述されているが、つまり、当時としても遅すぎる感があり、これは義経の本当の首ではないのではないかという憶測を生んだのであり、さらに義経は高舘では自刃していないという伝説を生んだ。これを義経不死伝説と呼んでいる。

海東村の口碑・傳説
1952年（昭和27年）発行の海東村史より、海東村の口碑・傳説の全文。海東村史には、10の逸話が記載されている。

九万ケ迫
北海東白岩区内にあり、四面山をめぐらす小山畠の地で古戦場と言い傳へらる。或時九万の大軍此の地に会戦し互に入り乱れて混戦乱闘、一大修羅場と化し屍山血河の惨状を呈した跡とか、後世此の地を開墾するに人骨諸所に出て耕人の胆を寒からしめたこと再三であつたといふ。若し今此地に一人立たんか松籟風々として往時を偲ばしむる時何処からともなく憂々たる馬蹄の響き、甲冑の音右往左往する中に火花を散らして切結ぶ劔戟の気勢までも目の辺りに聞え果ては山震い・地揺るゝような喊声を聞くことがあると言い傳ふ。

虎御前（とらごせ）
九万ケ迫から程遠からぬ所に一つの小塚がある、虎御前といふ。
九万ケ迫の会戦に一人の女房あり。敵味方の激戦を女の身の如何ともする事が出来ず物陰にかくれて只管味方の勝利を神佛に祈念したが、味方の軍容整はず浮足立つて見えたので、あら「腑甲斐ない味方の兵」と太刀振りかざして敵中に躍り入らうとした時、何処からともなく流れ来た矢に当り哀れ此の地の土と化した跡を弔ふ所の塚と言ふ。

城（じよう）
南海東早迫区にあり、小川町との村境に近く砂川のまさに隘所を曲りて小川に入らんとする所、川に臨んで高さ数丈の絶壁をなし自然の城廊を形作つてゐる。
往時源為朝此の地に城を構えようとした所と言ひ傳ふ。然るに或日為朝試に対岸の嫐迫堀切りの辺りから矢頃を計つた結果居城に適せずとして工事を取り止めた跡といふ。
又一説には同じく矢頃を計る為八丁峠に至り此の矢彼の地に達しなければ居城にしようと言つて矢を放つた処矢は遠く小川町六本杉に達したので工事を取り止めた跡とも言ふ。前説が真に近いようである。

塔之瀬
砂川の中流。西海東と南海東の接する辺り一大堰堤を作つて砂川の水を下流数十町歩の田地の灌漑用に引く。
往時此の堰の工事を思い立ち之に着手したが甚しい難工事で思ふ通りに砂川を堰く事が出来ず徒らに多大の日数費用人力を費やすのみであつた。思案の末或時其の工事の最難所に附近の正覚寺門内の一塔を懇ろに供養した後之を運んで堰の最難所に埋草とし一心に成就を祈つた処不思議にさしもの難工事も遂に成就したといふ。故に初めは塔の堰と言つてゐたのを後世塔の瀬と言ひ慣したものと言ひ伝へる。

舟橋（ふなばせ）
西海東西区上流橋附近をいふ。
砂川と言へば砂を思ひ、河床年々浅くなり、小やかな流れを思ふ。しかも小川町を距る一里の上流なる此の地々此の地名あるは如何にも奇しき思ひがするのである。
即ち此の小流砂川も往昔は川口から大小の船舶を通じ此の辺りまで舟行の便あり、此の地を舟泊所としたといふ。
砂川の舟運に就ては小川町東小川の砂川沿いに舟岩（ふないわ）といふがあり、昔難破船があり此処にその舟人の霊を祀るという小祠あり。
八代郡吉野村赤迫附近の貝塚、小川町と小野部田村境の田圃中に残る通称沖の塘、旧宮原街道、小野部田道等の状況等考察する時往時小川附近まで海であつたこと明で砂川の舟運の便、舟橋の伝説亦強ち南強附会とのみ言ふことは出来ないであらう。

八つ江の堤 西海東嫐迫
昔此の堤の中に棲んでゐた大蛇が美人に化げ此の附近に醫を業とする男と夫婦になり玉のやうな男の子が生れたと傳ふ。

七つ瀬
昔悪い大蛇がゐたので、篠原公が大蛇をずたずた七つ切りにして右の肩にかつがれたといふ地名の由来傳。

嫐迫の由来
昔此の地に一軒家があつて息子に嫁を貰つたが、外からも女を世話するもがあつてお祝ひの最中七人白装束が躍り込み、皿を打ち割つてしまつたので、此の家を嫐（わなり）と呼ぶことから地名となる。

やくさん原の次郎狐
小川に出るやくさん原の山越しに狐が沢山居た。次郎狐は川上次郎と名のつて参宮、だましの秘伝を習つたが、下岳のわしゆじから、おさん狐が嫁入つてきたといふ。

彼岸の川原祭由来
海東神社の御前、野添から宮園へ出る附近は今より六、七百年前は青々とした広い渕があつて、沢山の河童共がゐて、人や牛馬を寄つてたかつて渕の中に引込んでいた。
其の頃御宮の附近にゐた濱右衛門といふ力士の子供が河童から命を取られたといふので、敵打ちに河原に行つて「河童ども角力取りに来たぞ」と呼んだので、河童大将が数多の家来を連れて、やつて来たので、憤激してゐた力士は片つ端から河童を投げたが何の事もなく、癪にさわつて、蹴飛ばしても手ごたへがなく後では、さすがの力士も力及ばす却つて命があぶなくなつたので「自分の命をやるので村人や牛馬の命は取つてくれるな」と頼んだので河童共は其れを聞き、大きな力士の身体を渕の中に引き込んで行つたが、此の後絶えて水難がないので村人は濱右衛門殿「濱殿（ハマドン）」とあがめ、毎年春彼岸の終り日に御宮の真正面の河原に祭場を設け、力士の慰霊祭があり、御宮では團子投げの神事がある。
此の祭典は受持区域野添、鳥越、城、若市、嫐迫、日岳、和田、宮園、竹之中、講中である。

略史
帰雲城は当地の武将である内ヶ島氏の居城であった。寛正年間（1461年 - 1466年）の1462年頃、内ヶ島為氏により築城された。
天正13年11月29日（1585年1月18日）に天正地震が起き、帰雲山の崩壊で埋没。被害は埋没した家300戸以上､圧死者500人以上とされる。当日城内で祝宴が行なわれており、難を逃れたのは所用のため不在だったわずか4人と言われる。城主の内ヶ島氏理ら一族は全て死に絶えてしまい、この瞬間をもって内ヶ島氏は滅亡した。

立地
城のあった正確な位置は現在も特定されていない。保木脇に帰雲城趾の碑が建っている。この一帯では過去に土砂崩れがあったことは地質調査で判明しているが、碑の下に帰雲城が埋まっていると確認されているわけではない。
現在にかけて、幾度となく埋没した城を位置を特定しようとする試みが行われている。1972年（昭和47年）には、郷土史家などの手により「白川帰雲城・発掘保存準備委員会」が発足。近隣の神岡鉱山（三井金属鉱業）の技術支援を得ることも検討されたが、特定には至らなかった。
1993年（平成5年）に発足した「白川郷埋没帰雲城調査会」は、江戸時代の地誌や古地図から帰雲川左岸のいずれかにあったと推定しており、2027年に試験的な発掘調査を予定している。
保木脇集落は帰雲城城下町の名残ではなく、庄川水系でのダム建設に伴う移転先として昭和30年代（1955-65年）に形成された。庄川近くで採石場を営む建設会社の社長の夢に帰雲城の武将が現れたとして、帰雲山の崩壊跡を望む地に武将を祀る観音像や神社などを建て、地元住民も協力して公園化した。

貝塚御座所日記の記述
本願寺門主顕如の側近で、当時大坂にいた宇野主水が記した「貝塚御座所日記」（宇野主水日記）には、天正地震での各地の被害情報が記されているが、帰雲城について以下の記述がある。

他、『越中国名跡志』という史料にも同様の記述がある。

埋蔵金伝説
内ヶ島氏の領内に金山があったことから、地震で帰雲城の崩壊とともに金が地中に埋まったとされる埋蔵金伝説がある。しかし、この埋蔵金伝説は古くから白川地域に伝わっていたわけではなく、実際は1970年（昭和45年）頃に内ヶ島氏の末裔を称した白川村出身の人物が喧伝した話を、『大阪日日新聞』などが紙面に掲載したところから拡散したものであるということが指摘されている。
なお、テレビ愛知は帰雲城の埋蔵金伝説を調査追求する番組『消えた戦国の城』シリーズを2019年から放送している。

人物
出自・系譜
柿本臣は、孝昭天皇後裔を称する春日臣の庶流に当たる。人麻呂の出自については不明である。生前や死没直後の史料には出自・官途についても記載がなく、確実なことは不明である。

経歴
彼の経歴は『続日本紀』等の史書にも記載がないことから定かではなく、『万葉集』の詠歌とそれに附随する題詞・左注などが唯一の資料である。一般には天武天皇9年（680年）には出仕していたとみられ、天武朝から歌人としての活動を始め、持統朝に花開いたとみられる。ただし、近江朝に仕えた宮女の死を悼む挽歌を詠んでいることから、近江朝にも出仕していたとする見解もある。
江戸時代、賀茂真淵によって草壁皇子に舎人として仕えたとされ、この見解は支持されることも多いが、決定的な根拠はない。複数の皇子・皇女（弓削皇子、舎人親王、新田部親王など）に歌を奉っているので、特定の皇子に仕えていたのではないかとも思われる。近時は宮廷歌人であったと目されることが多いが、宮廷歌人という職掌が持統朝にはなく、結局は不明である。ただし、確実に年代の判明している人麻呂の歌は持統天皇の即位からその崩御にほぼ重なっており、この女帝の存在が人麻呂の活動の原動力であったとみるのは不当ではないと思われる。歌道の秘伝化や人麻呂に対する尊崇・神格化が進んだ平安後期から中世、近世にかけては、『人丸秘密抄』のように持統天皇の愛人であったと記す書籍や、山部赤人と同一人物とする論も現れるが、創作や想像による俗説・伝承である。
『万葉集』巻2に讃岐で死人を嘆く歌が載り、また石見国の鴨山における辞世歌と、彼の死を哀悼する挽歌が残されているため、官人となって各地を転々とし最後に石見国で亡くなったとみられることも多い。この辞世歌については、人麻呂が自身の死を演じた歌謡劇であるとの理解や、後人の仮託であるとの見解も有力である。また、文武天皇4年（700年）に薨去した明日香皇女への挽歌が残されていることからみて、草壁皇子の薨去後も都にとどまっていたことは間違いない。藤原京時代の後半や、平城京遷都後の確実な作品が残らないことから、平城京遷都前には死去したものと思われる。

歌風
彼は『万葉集』第一の歌人といわれ、長歌19首・短歌75首が掲載されている。その歌風は枕詞、序詞、押韻などを駆使して格調高い歌風である。また、「敷島の 大和の国は 言霊の 助くる国ぞ まさきくありこそ」という言霊信仰に関する歌も詠んでいる。長歌では複雑で多様な対句を用い、長歌の完成者とまで呼ばれるほどであった。また短歌では140種あまりの枕詞を使ったが、そのうち半数は人麻呂以前には見られないものである点が彼の独創性を表している。
人麻呂の歌は、讃歌と挽歌、そして恋歌に特徴がある。賛歌・挽歌については、「大君は 神にしませば」「神ながら 神さびせすと」「高照らす 日の皇子」のような天皇即神の表現などをもって高らかに賛美、事績を表現する。この天皇即神の表現については、記紀の歌謡などにもわずかながら例がないわけではないが、人麻呂の作に圧倒的に多い。また人麻呂以降には急速に衰えていく表現で、天武朝から持統朝という律令国家制定期におけるエネルギーの生み出した、時代に規制される表現であると言える。

恋歌に関しては、複数の女性への長歌を残しており、かつては多くの妻妾を抱えていたものと思われていた（斎藤茂吉などによる見解）。近時は恋物語を詠んだもので、人麻呂の実体験を歌にしたものではないとの理解が大勢である。ただし、人麻呂の恋歌的表現は共寝をはじめ性的な表現が少なくなく、窪田空穂が人麻呂は夫婦生活というものを重視した人であるとの旨を述べている（『万葉集評釈』）のは、歌の内容が事実・虚構であることの有無を別にして、人麻呂の表現のありかたをとらえたものである。
次の歌は枕詞、序詞を巧みに駆使しており、百人一首にも載せられている。ただし、これに類似する歌は『万葉集』巻11・2802の異伝歌であり、人麻呂作との明証はない。『拾遺和歌集』にも採られているので、平安以降の人麻呂の多くの歌がそうであるように、人麻呂に擬せられた歌であろう。

また、『古今和歌集』（7首）以下の勅撰和歌集に248首が入集している。

人麻呂の謎
官位について
同時代の各種史書上に人麻呂に関する記載がなく、その生涯については謎とされていた。古くは『古今和歌集』の真名序では五位以上を示す大夫を付して「柿本大夫」と記され、仮名序に正三位である「おほきみつのくらゐ」と書かれている。また、皇室讃歌や皇子・皇女の挽歌を歌うという仕事の内容や重要性からみても、高官であったと受け取られていた。
江戸時代、契沖や賀茂真淵らが史料に基づき、以下の理由から人麻呂は六位以下の下級官吏で生涯を終えたと唱えた。以降、現在に至るまで歴史学上の通説となっている。

五位以上の身分の者の事跡については、正史に記載されるはずであるが、人麻呂の名は正史に見られない。
死去に関して律令には、三位以上は薨、四位と五位は卒、六位以下は死と表記することとなっていた。『万葉集』の人麻呂の死去に関する歌の詞書には「死」と記されている。

梅原猛による異説
「人麻呂は下級官吏として生涯を送り、湯抱鴨山で没した」との従来説に対して、梅原猛は『水底の歌－柿本人麻呂論』において大胆な論考を行い、人麻呂は高官であったが政争に巻き込まれ、鴨島沖で刑死させられたとの「人麻呂流人刑死説」を唱え、話題となった。また、梅原は人麻呂と、伝説的な歌人・猿丸大夫が同一人物であった可能性を指摘した。しかし、学会において受け入れられるに至ってはいない。古代律令の律に梅原が想定するような水死刑は存在していないこと、また梅原が言うように人麻呂が高官であったのなら、それが『続日本紀』などに何一つ記されていない点などに問題があるからである。なお、この梅原説を参考にして、井沢元彦が著したデビュー作が『猿丸幻視行』である（ただし作中人物によって、益田勝実による批判が紹介されており、梅原説を肯定はしていない）。
『続日本紀』元明天皇の和銅元年（708年）4月20日の項に柿本猨（かきのもと の さる）の死亡記事がある。この人物こそが、政争に巻き込まれて皇族の怒りを買い、和気清麻呂のように変名させられた人麻呂ではないかと梅原らは唱えた。しかし当時、藤原馬養（のち宇合に改名）、高橋虫麻呂をはじめ、名に動物・虫など語を含んだ貴人が幾人もおり、「サル」という名前が蔑称であるとは言えないという指摘もある。柿本猨と人麻呂の関係については、ほぼ同時代を生きた同族という以上のことは明らかでない。益田勝実は、梅原が、人麻呂は処罰として名前を変えられ、位階も下げられたとし、死ぬまでには許されており位階ももとに戻ったため正史に記載されたとしていることから、それなら名前が猨のままなのはおかしいと指摘し、梅原はついに答えることができなかった。

旧跡
終焉の地
その終焉の地も定かではない。有力な説とされているのが、現在の島根県益田市（旧・石見国）である。地元では人麻呂の終焉の地としては既成事実としてとらえ、高津柿本神社としてその偉業を称えている。しかし人麻呂が没したとされる場所は、益田市沖合にあったとされる、鴨島である。「あった」とされるのは、現代にはその鴨島が存在していないからである。そのため、後世から鴨島伝説として伝えられた。鴨島があったとされる場所は、中世に地震（万寿地震）と津波があり、水没したといわれる。この伝承と人麻呂の死地との関係性はいずれも伝承の中にあり、県内諸処の説も複雑に絡み合っているため、いわゆる伝説の域を出るものではない。
その他にも、石見に帰る際、島根県安来市の港より船を出したが、近くの仏島で座礁し亡くなったという伝承がある。この島は現在の亀島と言われる小島であるという説や、河砂の堆積により消滅し日立金属安来工場の敷地内にあるとされる説があり、正確な位置は不明になっている。また他にも同県邑智郡美郷町にある湯抱鴨山の地という斎藤茂吉の説があり、益田説を支持した梅原猛の著作（前述）で反論の的になっている。

神社
平安時代後期以降、人麻呂は歌人として称えられるだけでなく、和歌の上達などに霊験がある存在として崇拝されるようになった。歌会に、人麻呂の絵姿と歌（人麻呂作と考えられた「ほのぼのと 明石の浦の朝霧に 島隠れ行く 舟をしぞ思ふ」）を掲げて、歌の上達を祈願する人麿影供（えいぐ）が行われるようになった。『十訓抄』などによると、藤原兼房が夢に現れた人麻呂を絵に描かせ、後に藤原顕季がこれを模写して影供を始めたという。
人麻呂を神として祀る神社や祠も各地に建てられた。高津柿本神社や柿本神社 (明石市)が著名である。「ひとまる」から「火止まる」「人産まる」と連想されて、庶民に防火・安全の神とされた例もある。

粕尾地方に居た名医中野智玄（録事法眼、略して録事尊とも）の雷神治療伝説と関連づけて語られる、鹿沼市中粕尾・上粕尾の思川沿いに伝わる珍しい事柄を集めたもの。『粕尾の民俗』では16個の不思議が紹介されている。

代表的な七不思議
雷によるケガの被害がない。
思川の川筋が変らない。
思川の川越えをする地点が変らない。
この3つは、平安時代末期から鎌倉時代の名医中野智玄が治療した雷神からの恩返し伝説の主要部分で理由付けられている。地元の寺院・常楽寺に残る『録事尊縁起』によれば、後鳥羽上皇の病を治して録事法眼の号を受けた中野智玄の所へ、あるとき病に難渋する雷神がやってきて治療をして貰い完治した。そこで御礼に、この地域へ雷害が無い事を約束するとともに、雷神の神力による降雨により、思川の治水工事を完成させ、思川の流れや形が末代まで変らないようにさせたと言う。その為、下・中・上粕尾では、人工的な治水工事が行なわれなかったにもかかわらず、水害が無いと言う。なお、一説には、中粕尾の中で布施谷地区から森地区までの間だけは、前記雷神の事業から除外され、治水の効力は概ね粕尾城跡より上流の地域か、常楽寺のある下粕尾かに分断されているとの『但し書き伝説』もある。

川沿草地の雑草の背丈が低く、チチコグサが生えない。
中野智玄と雷神との約束と、同じく雷神の神力により、田畑作の作業を阻害する、雑草の生育が悪く、成長しないようになっているとの言伝えがある。なお、チチコグサがはびこった時、洪水のサインになっているとの話も有る。

ノミのたかった猫が居ない。
中野智玄はノミのたかった猫に、彼の配合した駆除の薬を浴びせると、それ以後その猫にはノミがたからなくなった。なお中野智玄は雷神を完治させたおり、雷神より『龍起雷論』という医学書を賜ったとされている。この地域には以後も、ノミのたかった猫は居なくなった。彼の治療はその猫の子孫にも効き目があり、ノミのたかった別の地域の猫から、この地域の猫がノミをうつされる事も無かったという事になる。

ウズラがここでは鳴かない。
中野智玄の飼っていたウズラが、あるとき檻から逃げ出し、近くでウズラの鳴き声がした。「逃げたばかりか馬鹿にして鳴きやがって。」と智玄が怒った所、鳴いていたウズラが鳴くのを止めたという。このウズラばかりだけでなく、その後渡って来たウズラも、この地域では鳴かなくなったと言う。

クツワムシやスズムシの鳴き声が小さい。
クツワムシやスズムシの鳴き声が大きく、人の話が良く聞き取れないので、中野智玄が「うるさく鳴くな。」と怒った所、これらの虫の鳴声が、他の地域より小さくなったと言う。なお「異変を知らせる為なら、大声で鳴いてもよい。」と言い含めてあるとも言われている。

注記
粕尾七不思議は、中野智玄に関連するという特徴がある。また中身が、気象現象や地形の他、ある動物種や植物種全体に関するもので、稀な一匹・一株だけに限られたものではない点に特徴がある。ただしこれらの由来は、科学的な解明をされていない。

伝説のあらまし
『日本書紀』による片岡山伝説のあらすじは次のようなものである。
推古天皇21年（西暦613年）12月庚午朔、聖徳太子が片岡（片岡山）に遊行したとき、飢えた人が道に臥していたので、姓名を問うたが返事がなかった。太子はこれを見て飲食物を与え、また、自分の衣服を脱いでその人を覆い「安らかに寝ていなさい」と語りかけ、次の歌を詠んだ。

翌日、太子が使者を遣わしてその人を見に行かせたところ、使者は戻って飢者がすでに死んでいたことを告げた。太子は大いに悲しんで、飢人の遺体をその場所に埋葬して墓を固く封じさせた。数日後に太子は、近習の者を召して「過日埋葬した人は普通の人ではない。きっと真人（ひじり）にちがいない」と語り、墓を見に行かせた。使いが戻って来て「墓を動かした様子はありませんでしたが、棺を開いてみると屍も骨もありませんでした。ただ棺の上に衣服だけがたたんで置いてありました」と告げた。太子は再び使者を遣わして、自分がかつて与えたその衣服を持ち帰らせ、以前のように身に着けた。人々は大変不思議に思い、「聖（ひじり）は聖を知るというのは、真実だったのだ」と語って、ますます太子を畏敬した。

歴史的分析
多面的な聖人性
『万葉集』415番には「上宮聖德皇子竹原井に出遊のとき、竜田山の死人を見て悲しみ傷みて作れる歌」として次の歌が掲げられている。

『万葉集』では片岡山ではなく、より河内国（大阪府東部）との国境に近い竜田山となっており、いずれも行き倒れの旅人を傷むものとなっている。当時、道に倒れ、あるいは、溝に転落して落命する旅人は必ずしも稀ではなく、それだけに太子は旅人の境遇や家族の悲しみにも思いを馳せて歌を詠んだものであろうと思われる。
それだけであれば、聖徳太子は聖にして徳のある慈愛あふれる皇子であり、見知らぬ人に対しても忠恕の念をいだく儒教的な聖太子ということにすぎない。しかし、ここで注目されるのは、この説話における「聖人」（聖・真人）の概念の多面的・重層的な性格である。第一に「ひじり」はもともと日本古来の古代宗教（古い形態の神道）における霊的能力者を意味していたのであるが、そこに中国の「聖」の概念が重ねられる。「聖人」はまた、儒教における絶対的な帝王であり、仁を身につけ礼の実践に努める「君子」よりさらに上の、最高の道徳的人格者である。さらに「聖人」はまた仏教にあっては絶対者であるブッダ、すなわち悟りをひらいた仏の姿にほかならない。
そのうえ、「凡人に非し、必ず真人ならむ」や「聖の聖を知る、それ実なるかな」などの記述にみられるように、道教における「真人」、すなわち道の奥義（宇宙の根源）を悟り、自由の境地を得て仙人となった理想的人間像が重ねられる。「真人」はまた仏教にあっては仏陀である。さらに、墓をみたら死体がなかったという逸話は、神仙思想における「尸解」にかかわりをもっている。いったん死んだ様態を呈して墓から抜けて昇天するのは、不老不死を得た仙人すなわち「尸解仙」なのであり、これまた道教に深いかかわりを有している。
要するに、以上述べたような多面的・重層的な聖人性こそが太子にふさわしいものと考えられ、どの宗派や教義の立場からしても太子が聖人であるということを説話は示しているのである。

説話の付加
この説話に対して後世、実は、この飢人こそ、禅宗の始祖として知られる達磨その人であったという話が付加される。これは一見、はるか後の禅宗の徒による牽強付会のようにもみえるが、実は奈良時代末に敬明によって編まれた『上宮太子伝』に注記として記されたものであり、同時にこれは、太子が隋の南嶽慧思の生まれ変わりであるという説と密接にからんでいる。南嶽慧思は天台宗を開いた天台智顗の師であり、天台宗では第二祖とされる高僧で、特異の禅定と法華信仰をもって知られるが、その慧思が日本の王家に生まれ変わって太子となったという説が奈良時代末期の文献にみられる。そして慧思に日本への生まれ変わりを勧めたのが当時インドより中国にやって来た達磨であるとされる。とするならば、片岡山での邂逅はこの2人の再会であったという意味が付託される。

太子が用明天皇の皇子として飛鳥の地に誕生した時点においては慧思はまだ中国に生存していたのであるから、「生まれ変わり」はありえないわけではあるが、この説をさかんに普及させたのは唐からの渡来僧として著名な鑑真の弟子たち、すなわち唐より鑑真に同行した思託らをはじめとする律宗教団の人びとであったと考えられる。そして、最澄以降、天台宗が日本に定着していく過程で、この説は大きな役割を果たしたと考えられる。また、小野妹子が太子の命により遣隋使として煬帝のもとに派遣されたとき、太子の命で太子が未だ慧思であった際に用いた『法華経』を受け取りに出かけたという説もこれに加わる。
方岡山飢人説話は、9世紀初頭に薬師寺の僧景戒によって編纂された仏教説話集『日本霊異記』上巻でも確認されており、当時から広く知られた説話であったことがうかがわれる。同書の説話の末尾には「誠に知る聖人は聖を知り、凡夫は知らず、凡夫の肉眼には賤しき人と見え、聖人の通眼には隠身と見ゆ」と付言され、『日本書紀』記述の説話以上に仏教色の強い内容となっている。
ところで『日本書紀』においては、太子の仏教上の師である高句麗僧の慧慈が、太子の死をしきりに悼み、また「聖なる人」「大聖」と述べているが、さらに「三宝を恭み敬いて、黎元の厄を救う、是実の大聖なり」と述べたことを記している。ここにおける「聖」とは、上述のとおり解脱して悟りを得た者（仏）を意味しており、単に能力・識見にすぐれた人物というだけでなしに、平安時代には救世観音の化身であるという説も生じるなど、常人を越えた異能の人として崇敬されている。こうした諸説が成立する背景としては、太子が日本仏教の興隆に深くかかわったという歴史的事実を踏まえていることは言うまでもないが、一方ではすでに『日本書紀』の段階で異能の人として書き記されていることと無縁ではないと考慮される。
なお、聖徳太子伝説は以上のようなかたちで膨らんでゆくが、太子の伝説的な伝記は延喜17年（917年）成立といわれる『聖徳太子伝暦』に集大成されている。

説話の政治性と太子信仰の形成
聖徳太子の活躍は、古代日本が律令国家として発展していく第一歩を踏み出した時期であり、推古天皇の摂政兼皇太子として朝廷権力の中枢にあって諸改革を進めた時期に相当している。しかし、『日本書紀』の記述では、太子の政治活動は推古朝の前半期に偏っており、必ずしも後半期には充分に及んでいない。これについて、米田雄介は、聖徳太子の後半期の政治的社会的地位が前半期に比較して相対的に低下しているのではなく、太子は蘇我氏に擁されながらも、一方では蘇我氏に屈服していないという立場と目され、反蘇我氏の諸勢力のなかからも蘇我氏を統制しうる象徴的な存在としておおいに期待され、それゆえに脱世俗的な存在として聖化されたものであろうと推定している。
聖徳太子伝説の形成により、太子に対する崇拝・信仰は時代が下るとともにさかんになっていった。摂津国の四天王寺や河内国磯長（大阪府南河内郡太子町）の「太子廟」などは古くより数多の参詣者を集める一種の聖地である。太子信仰の実例については枚挙にいとまがないが、鎌倉時代、浄土真宗の開祖とされる親鸞が仏教者として初めて公然と妻帯することを決意したのも聖徳太子からの夢告によるものと信じられている。

古典文学における片岡山伝説
平安時代中期の11世紀初頭に成立したと考えられる勅撰和歌集『拾遺和歌集』には聖徳太子作として次の歌がある（『拾遺和歌集』巻20 哀傷1350）。

この歌と返し歌をもって『拾遺和歌集』最終巻は終わっている。返し歌は、

である。
なお、紫式部『源氏物語』第20帖「朝顔（あさかほ）」において、光源氏が老婆となった今も才色の衰えぬ源典侍にかけた言葉、

は、この歌をふまえたものであった。

伝承にゆかりのある土地
太子が遊行したという片岡山は、大和国葛下郡王寺（奈良県北葛城郡王寺町）周辺にあったといわれ、近くに畿内有数の古墳群である馬見古墳群がある。そこは、太子の居所があった斑鳩宮から大和・河内の国境に近い竜田山へと向かう途中にあり、それはまた、難波へとつらなる道筋に立地していた。現在、そこには片岡王寺伝承跡がのこっている。また、片岡山達磨寺が臨済宗南禅寺派の寺として現存しており、同寺の所蔵品として室町時代作の「達磨大師像」が知られる。

概要
小坂の金右衛門という者の家の前に小さな板橋があり、峠を越えて隣村へ行くためにさかんに利用されていた。
ある夜。金右衛門が家にいると、ガタガタと橋をわたる大きな音が聞こえ、ひそひそと人の声が聞こえた。こんな夜に峠越えは危険だと思って外を見ると、人影はまったく見えない。こうした不思議なことが毎晩続き、やがて雨の夜には橋をわたる音に混じって、悲しそうな泣き声が聞こえるようになった。
気味悪く思った金右衛門が占い師に占ってもらったところ、彼の家の前は隣村を越えて越中（現・富山県）立山まで続いており、立山にはさまざまな地獄があるので、地獄へ墜ちる亡者たちが橋を通っているとのことだった。
これを聞いた金右衛門は、家の者たちとともに橋から離れた場所へ引っ越すとともに、亡者たちを供養し、橋のそばには経塚を立てた。以来、これまでのような怪異はなくなったという。
なお、このほかにも音を伴った橋の名は「がたがた橋」「ドウドウ橋」「ドタドタ橋」など多くあり、川の流れが橋や橋桁にあたる音から想像されたものと考えられている。そのために飛騨の「がたがた橋」についても、同様に川の流れの音から「がたがた橋」と名づけられていたものが「立山地獄へ向かう亡者たちが境に架けられた橋の上をわたる音」と後付けの解釈を施されたもの、とする説もある。
立山地獄への通り道にまつわる類話として、岐阜や愛知県の亡者たちが立山地獄へ向かう途中、乗鞍岳山頂の千町ヶ原の沼で水を飲むという伝説があり、「精霊田（しょうらいだ）」と呼ばれた。

鹿角三姫の由来
吉祥姫（きっしょうひめ）：だんぶり（とんぼ）の導きにより、どんな病気も治る霊酒を手にし長者となった夫婦に一人娘の大変美しい桂子姫がいた。その美しさゆえ天皇（継体天皇）の后として宮中に召され吉祥姫と名を改めた。時はすぎ、長者夫婦もこの世を去り、京にいて両親の逝去を聞いた吉祥姫は、天皇のおぼしめしにより、長者が崇拝した大日神の社を古里に建立された。これが小豆沢にある大日堂である。その後、吉祥姫も不帰の人となり、ふるさとの土中に埋めてほしいという遺言により大日堂のそばに埋没された。墓のある寺を吉祥院という。
政子姫（まさこひめ）：鈴木地区に、郡司（貴族）の娘で政子姫という美しい姫がいた。姫は狭布の細布を織ることが上手であった。草木には、錦木は別名、仲人木といい恋文のかわりでもあった。市で見かけた美しい姫に心を奪われた若者は、毎日毎日、政子姫の門前に錦木をたてた。いつしか、姫も若者の心をあわれむようになったが、姫は、里の子どもたちを大鷲から守るため鳥の毛を混ぜた織物を織らねばならず、若者の心を受け入れることができなかった。あと一束で千束になるという日に若者は帰らぬ人となり、姫もその数日後、若者の後を追うようにこの世を去った。姫の父は二人をあわれに思い、千束の錦木とともに1つの墓に夫婦として葬った。その墓を錦木塚という。
芦名姫（あしなひめ）：むかし、芦名沢地区の長者の跡取り息子と豪族の一人娘の美しい姫が恋仲となったが、長者と豪族は仲が悪く、二人の結婚は許されそうになかった。美しい姫は、長者の息子恋しさに病になり、床に伏すようになった。息子も姫が病気と聞き一目会いたいと豪族の館のまわりを歩いていたが、怪しい曲者と捕らえられてしまった。豪族の家では、曲者（息子）を捕らえて打ち首にし、姫もその曲者に殺されたと言いふらして二人を遠くに旅立たせ、身代わりに馬二頭を埋没した。旅の途中で長者の息子は病に倒れ、一人故郷に戻った姫は、自分たちの身代わりになった二頭の馬を哀れに思い冥福を祈りながら、この世を去った。月日が経ち、事の真相を知った長者は金光明寺十一面観音堂を建て観世音菩薩像を祀り供養をした。その後、馬の神様として多くの絵馬が奉納されているのが芦名神社である。

概要
河童の妙薬の伝説に多くみられるあらすじは、河童が人間や馬に悪戯をし、その人間、もしくは馬の持ち主に懲らしめられ、詫びの印として薬を渡すというものである。河童が悪戯を懲らしめられる際に手を切り落とされ、後にその手を返してもらいに現れ、手を繋ぐ良い薬があるといって、手を返してもらう代わりにその薬を渡したり、調薬の方法を教えたりすることもある。薬の種類には、骨接ぎ、打ち身、熱傷に効く薬などがある。河童は相撲が好きで、怪我が多いためにこうした薬を持っていると考えられ、水の妖怪である河童が金属を嫌う性質から、刃物による切創に効果が高いなどともいわれる。
茨城県小美玉市与沢にある手接神社も、こうした伝説上の河童を祀ったものであり、伝説にちなんで手の負傷や病気に利益があるといわれ、手の治療を願う者は手の形をした絵馬を奉納する風習がある。また、隣町の同県行方市玉造には、この河童が悪戯の際に手を斬り落とされたといわれる川の橋に「手奪橋」の名が残されている。
日本各地の郷土地誌によれば、かつては伝説にちなむ薬が家伝薬として実際に販売されていた。代表的なものとして、茨城県那珂郡大宮町（現・常陸大宮市）の万能家伝薬「岩瀬万応薬」、新潟市の猫山宮尾病院の湿布薬「猫山アイス」等がある。後にはこうした家伝薬の販売はすべて廃れているが、これは薬事法が改正されたため、および明治時代に入って医学が漢方医学から西洋医学へ移行し、薬の販売が売薬本舗から製薬業へ移行したためと考えられている。
悪戯の詫びの際に、河童が薬ではなく骨接ぎの方法を教えるという伝説もあり、骨接ぎで知られる新潟県阿賀野市の猫山病院など、代々続く接骨医が河童から接骨法を伝授されたと称していることも多い。伝説にちなみ、接骨院が河童をシンボルキャラクターに掲げていることもある。

類例
変わった類例として、岡山県の郷土史家・岡長平の著書『岡山太平記』に「狸伝膏（ばけものこう）」という話がある。河童ではなくタヌキが人間に悪戯をし、河童の伝説同様に腕を切り落とされ、その腕を返してもらうかわりに骨接ぎの薬を渡すという伝説である。また延宝時代の怪談集『宿直草』にも「たぬき薬の事」と題し、同様に悪戯をしたタヌキが、切り落とされた手と引き換えに妙薬の製法を教える話がある。河童の妙薬の話はこの『宿直草』の時代よりも後に民間に登場しているため、「たぬき薬の事」が改変されて河童の伝説が生まれたとも考えられている。

御伽草子版
『宝物集』で記された金礫の説話が御伽草子『鈴鹿の草子』『田村の草子』などの田村語りに採り入れられると、金礫を打つこの化生の名前として、こんざう、りゃうせん（りょうせん）などがみえる。『田村の草子』によるあらすじは次のとおりである。
大和国奈良坂に金礫を打つりょうせんという化生の者が現れて都への貢ぎ物や多くの人の命を奪ったので、帝は稲瀬五郎坂上俊宗に鬼退治の宣旨を下した。俊宗は500騎の兵を連れて奈良坂へと向かい、良い小袖を木々の枝に掛け並べてりょうせんを待った。すると背丈が2丈（約6メートル）もある異様な風体の法師が現れ、並び立てた着物を置いていけと大笑いする声が聞こえた。俊宗が着物を渡すわけにはいかないというと、法師は三郎礫と名付けられた金の礫を打ち、俊宗は扇で落とした。続けて次郎礫が打たれるが、これも俊宗に打ち落とされ、最後に太郎礫を打つも鐙の端で蹴落とされた。りょうせんは山へと逃げはじめるが、俊宗が三代に渡って受け継いできた神通の鏑矢を射放つと7日7夜に渡ってりょうせんを追い続け、りょうせんはついに降伏する。りょうせんを捕縛した俊宗は都へと凱旋して御門に閲覧し、りょうせんは船岡山で処刑されることとなった。その首は8人ががりで切り落とされて獄門にかけられ、行き交う者たちにさらされた。

武器としての金礫
『田村の草子』では、りょうせんが金礫を打つ腕前は唐土にて500年、高麗国にて500年、日本で80年、奈良坂で3年かかって磨いたものであったという。また太郎礫、次郎礫、三郎礫という3つの金礫を使い、太郎礫は600両の金を使い山を盾にしようとも微塵に打ち崩してしまうほどの金の礫で、三郎礫は300両の金の礫である。

概要
葬式の列を雷雨と共に襲った妖怪が、一蓮寺の和尚によって懲らしめられ、二度と雷を落とさないという誓いの証しとして唐傘に手形を捺していった。寺に残されている唐傘がそれだと語られていたという。
江戸時代の甲府勤番の武士だった野田成方の日記である『裏見寒話』に書かれている一蓮寺の記事中に、「手形傘」としてその由来が記されている。妖怪が手形を捺していったのは、日傘として用いる長柄の唐傘で、捺されている手形は、大きなネコの足跡のような形状だと記載されている。
雷雲から現れた妖怪は、『裏見寒話』に記載された由来のなかでは「怪物」や「怪獣」とあり、おそろしい獣のような姿だったとされる。

あらすじ
昔、一蓮寺で葬式が行われていたところ、突然に雷雲が現れて激しい雷雨になり、参列者たちは大いに恐れおののいた。一蓮寺の和尚は本堂にある龕（厨子）にのぼって少しもひるむことなく読経をつづけたが、そこに雷が落ち、雷雲の中から毛だらけの大きな手が出て来て和尚をつかもうとした。和尚は手を伸ばして怪物の腕をつかみ返し、しばらくの力比べの後、怪物は雲の中から引きずり下ろされた。怪物は「雲が消えては天へ帰れない」と命乞いをしたところ、和尚は「寺や檀家を嵐や雷で襲ったりしないと誓うなら、許しても良い」と言った。怪物が承知したところ、和尚は証文を書くようにと硯箱を出した。怪物は「私は怪物なので字を知らない。証文だけは勘弁してほしい」と頼んだ。和尚は「ならばこの墨をてのひらにつけて、日傘に手形を捺せ」と命じたので、怪物は言われる通り、傘に手形を捺した。以来、和尚は葬式のときにはその手形の押された唐傘を日傘として差すようになり、怪物が雷を落とすことは二度となかった。甲斐国中の人々はこの和尚の剛力を尊敬し「朝比奈和尚」と称したという。

朝比奈和尚
持前の剛力で怪物退治をしたとされる一蓮寺の和尚は、その怪力を褒め讃えて人々から朝比奈和尚と称されていたという。「朝比奈」は怪力で知られる伝説の武将・朝比奈三郎からの呼び名で、『裏見寒話』には具体的な和尚の代数や実名は登場していない。

伝承
益田川河口から500メートルないし1キロメートル沖合にあったとされる。東西約2キロメートル・南北約300メートルで、本土とは砂州でつながった陸繋島であり、岩盤の上に砂が堆積しただけの低い砂丘の島であったと考えられている。また、鴨島の東には同規模の鍋島があり、さらに東の遠田沖には柏島があった。伝承によれば、在りし日の鴨島は外浜と内浜にそれぞれ良港を持ち、日本海を行き交う船は必ず立ち寄るほど繁盛した島であったという。島には「鴨山」と呼ばれる小高い地があって、柿本人麻呂はそこで没し、後の神亀年間に聖武天皇の勅命によって人麻呂神社とその別当寺「人丸寺」が建立されたとされる。他に、千福寺・万福寺の2寺があった。
しかし、1026年6月16日（万寿3年5月23日）深夜に発生したとされる万寿地震によって一夜にして海中に没し、人麻呂神社・人丸寺・千福寺・万福寺の1社3寺と約500軒の民家は悉く流出し壊滅した。鍋島・柏島も同じくこの時に陥没したと伝えられている。

また、このとき流された人麻呂神社の神体であった神像が対岸の松崎に漂着したため、その地に改めて柿本神社と人丸寺が再建されたという。現在の高津柿本神社は、1681年（延宝9年）に風水害を懸念した津和野藩主亀井茲親によって松崎から現在地に移転されたものである。
現在、地元で「大瀬」と呼ぶ暗礁が鴨島の、「三瀬」と呼ぶ暗礁が鍋島の陥没した跡だとされている。「大瀬」は、浅いところで水深3メートルから6メートル、深いところで水深12メートルから13メートルで、短径300メートル面積20万平方メートルの楕円形をしており、波の荒れた日には「大瀬」の上に白波が立つのを見ることができる。
その「大瀬」で1901年（明治34年）8月21日に地元の漁師が海中から引き上げた漢鏡や双盤が、中須の福王寺に保存されている。

伝承に対する疑義
一方、これらの伝承は専ら口碑によるものであり、鴨島や地震・津波について述べた同時代史料は存在しない。万寿地震とその被害を指すと思われる記述が確認できるのは400年以上後の1430年（永享2年）に著された『徹書記物語』が初出であるし、それ以降に記された書物についても、多くは荒唐無稽な伝説を記しているのみで史料としての信頼性は高いものではない。さらに、それら史料にもはっきりと「地震」と記述されたものはない。また、そもそもこの地域では、暴風雨による高潮こそ発生することはあるものの、地震による津波の被害は少ない。

こうした事実から、柿本人麻呂の終焉地をめぐる論争も関わって、鴨島に関する伝承について懐疑的な見方も存在する。柿本人麻呂の辞世の句とされる「鴨山の岩根し枕けるわれをかも知らにと妹が待ちつつあるらむ」（『万葉集』233）の「鴨山」がどこであったのか、すなわち柿本人麻呂の終焉地がどこであるのかについて、前述のとおり地元では鴨島にあった鴨山を終焉地とみなしているが、江戸末期から明治期の国学者である藤井宗雄は、著書『石見国名跡考』で浜田の亀山を支持する立場から、高津鴨島説に対して「万寿の海溢に托して、遁辞せるなり。」と述べてこれを否定した。また、歌人の斎藤茂吉も1936年（昭和11年）に発表した著書『柿本人麻呂』の中で「それが万寿の海嘯でなくなったとしても、どういふ作用でなくなったか、もっと科学的に説明が欲しい。さういふ研究論文の有無を知らぬのである。」と高津鴨島説を非科学的と否定した上で、新たに邑智郡粕淵村（現在の美郷町）湯抱の鴨山であるとする説を立てた。
これらの疑義に対して、地元の郷土史家矢富熊一郎は、1964年（昭和39年）に『柿本人麻呂と鴨山』を著し、地理的な考察を以てこれに反論した。また、伝承から推測される地盤の隆起・沈降のパターンは1872年（明治5年）に発生した浜田地震によるパターンと一致すると指摘されている。

学術調査
梅原猛による調査
1972年（昭和47年）から、哲学者の梅原猛は雑誌『すばる』に「水底の歌（柿本人麻呂）」を連載して柿本人麻呂終焉の地として高津鴨島説を支持し、流刑説を唱えた。翌1973年（昭和48年）には『水底の歌-柿本人麿論』として出版され、鴨島伝説は再び議論の的となった。
1977年（昭和52年）、梅原は自ら団長となり7月16日から7月26日にかけて「大瀬」の海底調査を行った。調査チームはプロのダイバーや水中カメラマンをはじめ、NHKの撮影チームも同行する大規模なものとなった。この調査では、「大瀬」の岩盤とは異なる安山岩からなる直径20センチメートルから30センチメートルの砲丸のような礫が多数発見され、波蝕によって形成されたと思われる高さ1.2メートルと2メートルの2つの典型的な茸状岩（きのこ岩）や海蝕甌穴3か所など特徴的な微地形が確認されている。円礫は暗礁である「大瀬」に自然に乗り上げたと考えるのは困難であったし、いかに波の強い日本海とはいえ水深8メートルから11メートルの海底で茸状岩や海蝕甌穴を形成するほど波蝕が進むとも考えられない。これらから調査チームは、「大瀬」は過去の一時期島ないし半島であり、その後急速に水没したと推定したが、それが地震や津波によるものであったのか、また、いつの頃のことであるのかまでは確定することができなかった。

松井孝典による調査
1993年（平成5年）2月、地球物理学者の松井孝典を団長、同じく地球物理学者の竹内均を副団長とする「鴨島海底学術調査団」が結成され、翌1994年（平成6年）にかけて最新のレーダーなどを用いた益田市沖の海底検査や陸地でのトレンチ調査などが実施された。
まず、海底音波探査によって、海底に地殻変動による横ずれ断層が確認された。そして、益田川沿いでかつて沼地であったと思われる地点を選んで行われたトレンチ調査では、特徴的な砂の層が認められた。その砂層は河口域で特徴的に見られる珪藻の殻を含み、下層の泥質層との間は水分を含んだ泥の上に急激に砂がたまった際に見られる顕著な火炎状構造を示していたことから、この砂層は益田川を遡った津波によってもたらされたものと考えられた。そして、その砂層直下の泥質層の放射性炭素年代測定を行ったところ BP 930 ± 80 となり、万寿年間に津波が発生したとする伝説を裏付ける結果となった。
こうした調査結果を受けて、鴨島海底学術調査団は益田市内で記者会見を開き、「鴨島の存在の大前提となる万寿の地震と津波は確かにあった。伝承が正しかったと科学的にいえるのではないか」と報告した。ただし、これらによっても大津波の存在が裏付けられたに過ぎず、鴨島跡を特定するまでには至っていない。

あらすじ
筑前国の武将、加藤左衛門尉繁氏は、妻と妾の醜い嫉妬心（上辺は親し気に振る舞いながら髪の毛が蛇と化して絡み合う様子）を見て世の無常を感じ、領地と家族を捨てて出家し、寂昭坊等阿法師、苅萱道心（かるかやどうしん）と号して、源空上人（法然）の下で学び、二度と自分の家族に会わず仏道の修行だけに生涯を捧げる棄恩入無為の誓いを立てて高野山に登った。
その息子である石童丸(いしどうまる)は父親の顔を知らずに育ったが、十四歳の時、出家した父親の話を聞き、母と共に父親探しの旅に出る。旅の途中に出会った僧侶から父親らしい僧が高野山に居ると聞くが、高野山は女人禁制のため、石童丸は母を麓の宿に置いて一人で山に登り、偶然出会った僧侶に父親の行方を尋ねる。その僧侶こそは石童丸の父親である刈萱道心その人であったが、刈萱道心は目の前の少年が自分の息子であることに気付きながらも、棄恩入無為の誓いのために、自分が父親だと名乗ることはできず、「そなたの父親はすでに死んだ」と嘘をつき、それを聞いた石童丸は涙ながらに山を下った。石童丸が高野山から戻ると、母は長旅の疲れが原因ですでに他界していた。頼る身内を失った石童丸は再び高野山に登り、刈萱道心の弟子となって共同生活を始めたが、道心はその後も死ぬまで真実を語ることはなく、石童丸も道心を父親だとは知らないまま生涯を終えたという哀話。

成立
苅萱物語は高野山萱堂（刈萱堂）を中心とする萱堂聖と呼ばれる聖集団によって生み出され、伝承されてきたと言われる。その原型となる遁世説話が中世にはいくつかあり、『西行物語』序盤の西行が出家に至るくだりや、『平家物語』の斎藤時頼出家の逸話も、そのひとつに挙げられる。室町時代に入り、それらの原型となる説話から謡曲、説教の『苅萱』が作られた。
江戸時代中期に説教を元に、浄瑠璃『石童丸』、『苅萱道心物語』が作られ、歌舞伎『苅萱桑門筑紫いえづと』（1735年）へと発展した。また、日本各地の苅萱伝説を集成した勧化本『苅萱道心行状記』（1749年）が作られ、以来、妻と妾の争いなど従来にないエピソードの追加や、二人の出家後の房号法名など新たな設定が盛り込まれるなど、物語が整えられていった。

伝説
崇徳天皇の頃、博多の守護職だった苅萱道心の父、加藤繁昌は子宝に恵まれず、香椎宮に祈願したところ「石堂口付近に玉のような温石があり、それを妻に与えると男子が出生する」とお告げがあり、探してみたところ古い地蔵尊の左手に卵のような形の光を放つ石をみつけた。やがて妻は懐胎し、生まれた子供に石堂丸と名付けた。温石のあった石堂地蔵は博多にあった七堂のひとつであり、刈萱地蔵、子授け地蔵と呼ばれている。成長した石堂丸は加藤左衛門尉繁氏として父の守護職を継ぎ、太宰府の刈萱の関の関守となった。太宰府市坂本(坂本八幡宮近く)には刈萱の関跡の標柱があり、伝説のゆかりの地とされている。
高野山に去った繁氏を追った妻の千里は播磨国の太山寺で石童丸を出産したと伝えられ、神戸市西区には石童丸産湯の井戸がある。
高野山北麓の参詣口にあたる学文路に至った石童丸母子は玉屋という宿屋に逗留したが、千里はこの地で亡くなったという。橋本市学文路の苅萱堂仁徳寺には、苅萱親子を祀る親子地蔵と千里の墓がある。

芸能・文学上の「苅萱」
中世に起源をもつ「苅萱」の物語は当時を生きる人の胸をうち、以来、多くの芸能や文学で扱われる重要なテーマとなってきた。以下にその代表例を掲げる。

平成以降の現代においても、それらにちなんだ神事や祭事が日本各地で開催されている。

怪火としての「狐の嫁入り」
宝暦時代の越後国（現・新潟県）の地誌『越後名寄』には、怪火としての「狐の嫁入り」の様子が以下のように述べられている。

ここでは夜間の怪火が4キロメートル近く並んで見えることを「狐の婚」と呼ぶことが述べられており、同様に新潟県中頚城郡や同県魚沼地方、秋田県、茨城県桜川市桜川市、同県西茨城郡七会村（現・城里町）、同県常陸太田市、埼玉県越谷市や同県秩父郡東秩父村、東京都多摩地域、群馬県、栃木県、山梨県北杜市武川村、三重県、奈良県橿原市、鳥取県西伯郡南部町などで、夜間の山野に怪火（狐火）が連なって見えるものを「狐の嫁入り」と呼ぶ。
かつて江戸の豊島村（現・東京都北区豊島、同区王子）でも、暗闇に怪火が連続してゆらゆらと揺れるものが「狐の嫁入り」と呼ばれており、これは同村に伝わる「豊島七不思議」の一つにも数えられている。
地方によっては様々な呼び名があり、同様のものを埼玉県草加市や石川県鳳至郡能都町（現・鳳珠郡能登町）では「狐の嫁取り（きつねのよめとり）」といい、静岡県沼津市などでは「狐の祝言（きつねのしゅうげん）」とも呼ぶ。徳島県では、こうした怪火を嫁入りではなく狐の葬式とし、死者の出る予兆としている。
日本で結婚式場の普及していなかった昭和中期頃までは、結婚式においては結婚先に嫁いでゆく嫁が夕刻に提灯行列で迎えられるのが普通であり、連なる怪火の様子が松明を連ねた婚礼行列の様子に似ているため、または狐が婚礼のために灯す提灯と見なされたためにこう呼ばれたものと考えられている。嫁入りする者が狐と見なされたのは、嫁入りのような様子が見えるにもかかわらず実際にはどこにも嫁入りがないことを、人を化かすといわれる狐と結び付けて名づけられた、または、遠くから見ると灯りが見えるが、近づくと見えなくなってしまい、あたかも狐に化かされたようなため、などの説がある。
新潟県の麒麟山にも狐が多く住み、夜には提灯を下げた嫁入り行列があったといわれるが、この新潟や奈良県磯城郡などでは狐の嫁入りは農業と結び付けて考えられており、怪火の数が多い年は豊年、少ない年は不作といわれた。これについては、狐火がリンの発光と考えられていたことから（狐火#正体も参照）、狐火の多い時期には、農作物の生育に必要不可欠なリンが土中に多く生成されていたとも考えられている。
これらの怪火の正体については、実際の灯を誤って見たか、異常屈折の光を錯覚したものとも考えられている。また、戦前の日本では「虫送り」といって、農作物を病害から守るため、田植えの後に松明を灯して田の畦道を歩き回る行事があり、狐の嫁入りが田植えの後の夏に出現する、水田を潰すと見えなくなったという話が多いことから、虫送りの灯を見誤ったとする可能性も示唆されている。

	狐の嫁入り

天候に関する言い伝え
関東地方、中部地方、近畿地方、中国地方、四国、九州など、日本各地で天気雨のことを「狐の嫁入り」と呼ぶ。
怪火と同様、地方によっては様々な呼び名があり、青森県南部地方では「狐の嫁取り」、神奈川県茅ヶ崎市芹沢や徳島県麻植郡山類では「狐雨（きつねあめ）」、千葉県東夷隅郡では同様に「狐の祝言」という。千葉県東葛飾郡でも青森同様に「狐の嫁取り雨（きつねのよめどりあめ）」というが、これは、かつてこの地域の農家では嫁は労働力と見なされ、一家の繁栄のために子孫を生む存在として嫁を「取る」ものと考えられていたことに由来する。
天気雨をこう呼ぶのは、晴れていても雨が降るという嘘のような状態を、何かに化かされているような感覚を感じて呼んだものと考えられており、かつて狐には妖怪のような不思議な力があるといわれていたことから、狐の仕業と見なして「狐の嫁入り」と呼んだともいう。ほかにも、天気雨のときには狐の嫁入りが行なわれているとも、山のふもとは晴れていても山の上ばかり雨が降る天気雨が多いことから、山の上を行く狐の行列を人目につかせないようにするため、狐が雨を降らせると考えられたとも、めでたい日にもかかわらず涙をこぼす嫁もいたであろうことから、妙な天気である天気雨をこう呼んだとも、日照りに雨がふるという異様さを、前述の怪火の異様さを転用して呼んだともいう。
狐の嫁入りと天候との関連は地方によって異なることもあり、熊本県では虹が出たとき、愛知県では霰が降ったときに狐の嫁入りがあるという。

古典・伝説での「狐の嫁入り」
前述までのように嫁入りを思わせる自然現象だけではなく、江戸時代の古書や、地域によっては伝説上にも、実際に嫁入りの痕跡が見られるという話がある。埼玉県行田市では、谷郷の春日神社に狐の嫁入りがよく現れるといい、そのときには実際に道のあちこちに狐の糞があったという。岐阜県武儀郡洞戸村（現・関市）では、怪火が見えるだけではなく、竹が燃えて裂ける音が聞こえるなどが数日続き、確かめてもそんな痕跡はないといわれた。
寛永時代の随筆『今昔妖談集』には江戸の本所竹町、文政時代の草紙『江戸塵拾』には同じく江戸の八丁堀、寛政時代の怪談集『怪談老の杖』には上州（現・群馬県）神田村で、それぞれ奇妙な嫁入り行列が目撃され、それが実は狐だったという話がある。
このように狐同士の婚礼をそれとなく人間たちに見せる話は、全国的に分布している。一例として民間の伝承においては、埼玉県草加市の伝承で、戦国時代、ある女性が恋人と結婚を約束したにもかかわらず病死してしまい、その無念さが狐に乗り移り、女性の葬られた場所の付近で狐の嫁入り行列が見られるようになったという伝説がある。また信濃国（現・長野県）の民話では、ある老人が子狐を助けたところ、やがて成長した狐が婚礼を迎え、老人に礼として引出物を持参したという話がある。こうした嫁入りの話では、前述までのような自然現象および超自然の「狐の嫁入り」が舞台装置のように機能しており、日中の嫁入りは天気雨の中、夜間の嫁入りは怪火の中で行なわれることが多い。
特定の動作を行なうことで狐の嫁入りが見えるという伝承も各地にあり、福島県では旧暦10月10日の夕方にすり鉢を頭にかぶり、腰にすりこぎをさしてマメガキの下に立つ、愛知県では井戸に唾を吐き、指を組み合わせてその穴から覗くと、狐の嫁入りが見えるという。
江戸時代頃には、こうした「狐の嫁入り」の伝承が信じられていたことから、人間が狐に仮装して「狐の嫁入り」を演じたとしても、庶民にはそれを見破ることができなかったとして、人為的な仕掛けであった可能性も示唆されている。

狐同士の結婚ではなく、人間の男性のもとに雌の狐が嫁ぐ話もあり、代表的なものとしては、人形浄瑠璃にもなり、平安時代の陰陽師・安倍晴明の出生にまつわるものとしても知られる『葛の葉』が挙げられる。このほかにも『日本現報善悪霊異記』や、1857年（安政4年）の地誌『利根川図志』などに同様の話がある。後者は、関東の諸葛孔明と喩えられる実在の武将・栗林義長にまつわるもので、茨城県牛久市の女化町の名の由来でもあり、同県龍ケ崎市に女化神社として狐が祀られている。
また『今昔物語集』や、1689年（元禄2年）の『本朝故事因縁集』、1696年（元禄9年）の怪談集『玉掃木』には、既婚の男のもとに、狐がその妻に化けて現れる話がある。ちなみに1677年（延宝5年）の怪談集『宿直草』では逆に、雄の狐が人間の女性に惚れ、その女の夫に化けて契り、異形の子供が生まれる話がある。

関連作品
江戸時代の浮世絵師・葛飾北斎による『狐の嫁入図』では、天気雨のときには狐の嫁入りがあるという俗信に基き、狐の嫁入り行列と、突然の天気雨に驚いて農作物を取り込む人々の様子が描かれている（画像参照）。このように、空想上の情景として狐たちと現実の農村風俗とを同時に絵画の中に描くことは珍しい例と指摘されている。
同時代の俳諧師・小林一茶の句にも「秋の火や山は狐の嫁入雨」とある。明治時代の俳人・歌人である正岡子規は短歌で「青空にむら雨すぐる馬時狐の大王妻めすらんか」と読んでいる。
人形浄瑠璃『壇浦兜軍記』（1732年初演）でも「たつた今までくわんくわんした天気であったが、ええ聞こえた、狐の嫁入のそばえ雨」とあり、戦後では時代小説『鬼平犯科帳』に「狐雨」と題した1篇がある。

そのほかに1785年（天明5年）の『無物喰狐婿入』（北尾政美画）、1796年（寛政8年）の『昔語狐娶入』（北尾重政画）、1799年（寛政11年）の『穴賢狐縁組』（十返舎一九画）などの江戸時代の草双紙や黄表紙、『祝言狐のむこ入』『絵本あつめ草』といった江戸時代の上方絵本にも、擬人化された狐が嫁入りを行なう「狐の嫁入り」が描かれている。これらは擬人化された動物の嫁入りを描いた「嫁入り物」と呼ばれる種類の作品だが、狐たちに江戸の具体的な稲荷神の名前が付けられているという特徴がある。このことは、稲荷信仰と嫁入り物の双方が江戸の庶民に深く浸透していたことを示すものと見られている。
民間では、高知県の赤岡町（現・香南市）などで、「日和に雨が降りゃ 狐の嫁入り」という童歌があり、天気雨の日には実際に狐の嫁入り行列が見られるといわれた。

関連行事
前述の新潟県の麒麟山の嫁入り行列に由来する祭事として、同県東蒲原郡阿賀町津川地区では「狐の嫁入り行列」が行われている。もとは狐火の名所として、昭和27年頃から狐火に関するイベントが行われており、一度は途絶えたこのイベントが、1990年に嫁入り行列を主体とした観光イベントとして復活されたもので、毎年4万人もの観光客で賑わっている（詳細は狐の嫁入り行列を参照）。
山口県下松市の花岡福徳稲荷社でも、毎年11月3日の稲穂祭で「きつねの嫁入り」が行われている。こちらは同神社で古くから行なわれていた豊作祈願の稲穂祭が、戦後の混乱期に途絶えていたところを、地元の有志たちが、同神社で白い狐の夫婦が失せ物捜しや五穀豊穣・商売繁盛の神として祀られていたことを参考にして、狐夫婦の結婚式を再現したものとも、江戸時代に寺の住職が、夢枕に現れた白い狐夫婦の依頼で供養をしたところ、紛失していた数珠が見つかったという伝説にちなんで、1950年（昭和25年）から始まったともいう。下松市民の中から狐夫婦を演じる市民が選ばれるが、新婦役となった女性は良縁に恵まれることから、同神社は縁結びの利益もあるといわれている。
三重県四日市市海山道の海山道稲荷神社でも、毎年節分に「狐の嫁入り道中」の神事が行われる。こちらも江戸時代に追儺として行われていたものが、やはり戦後に甦ったもので、その年の厄年の男女が、神使の総本家での子狐と、海山道稲荷神社の神使の家の娘の狐に扮し、嫁入りの様子が再現され、大勢の参拝客の賑わいを見せている。

解説
宇都宮市には「昔天然痘が流行った時に、黄色いフナが市中心部の田川で釣れ、病人がその身を食べたところ治癒した」という伝説がある。きぶなを食べた人は病気にならなかったが、きぶなを釣るのは難しかったため、フナを模した縁起物の張り子を作って正月に軒下に吊るしたり、神棚に供えたりする習慣が生まれた。きぶなは長さ約30センチメートルの細い竹竿に吊り下げられた張り子で、頭部は赤色、ひれは黒色、胴体が黄色、尻尾が緑色と色鮮やかである。
昔は宇都宮市南新町の農家の副業として多くの人が制作していたが、その後西原町の浅川仁太郎（1906年1月30日生）と次男の浅川俊夫（1945年12月25日生）の2人だけが技術を継承した。仁太郎の死後はかんぴょうやふくべ（ユウガオの実）の細工を手掛ける小川昌信が、きぶなの消失を危惧する人々の勧めで技術を継承し、従来の張り子にとどまらない商品展開を行った。小川の店は「ふくべ洞」といい、宇都宮市大通り2-4-8にある。
制作の手順をおおまかに記すと、きぶなの木型に和紙を張りつけて1日半ほど乾燥させる。きぶなの腹部を切って木型を取り出して切り口に紙を張る。ニカワできぶなのひれを付け半日ほど乾燥させてからひれを整型する。胡粉をぬり半日ほど乾燥させる。赤・黄色などの絵の具で着色する。
毎年1月11日の初市に上河原の初市会場と宇都宮二荒山神社の参道で販売されてきた。宇都宮市内の物産店でも販売するようになった。通常は張り子や土鈴であるが、ストラップ、キーホルダー、ハンチング帽、こいのぼりなどの派生品もある。黄鮒を模した最中やご当地キティや日本酒の銘柄としても使用される。
きぶなにちなんだキャラクターの「郷土玩具怪獣 キブナドン」（郷土を守る優しい怪獣）が2014年頃から登場した。

新型コロナウイルスときぶな
2020年（令和2年）の新型コロナウイルス感染症の日本での流行を受け、ソーシャル・ネットワーキング・サービス（SNS）では妖怪のアマビエに関心が集まる一方、宇都宮市ではきぶなへの関心が高まっている。伝統的に行われてきたように、玄関先にきぶなを吊るして無病息災を祈願する人や、きぶなグッズを買い求める人、SNSで「黄ぶな運動」を展開する人、きぶなのお守りを作り医療従事者に届ける人、「黄ぶな体操」を広める人、新たにきぶなを描いたTシャツを販売する店が現れた。
黄ぶな運動とはSNSでハッシュタグ「#黄ぶな運動」を付けて、黄ぶな関連情報、健康管理のための情報、お店のテイクアウト情報、新型コロナウイルス関連助成金制度の情報や中止・延期となったイベントに関する情報など共有できる有益な情報発信するという運動である。イラストをSNSに投稿することも黄ぶな運動に含まれる。この運動をきっかけにきぶな周知に大きく貢献した。また、宇都宮市出身の漫画家・湯沢としひとは、黄ぶな運動の影響を受けSNSできぶなを主人公とする「黄ぶな係長」という漫画の連載を開始した。2021年のこいのぼりシーズンには、静岡県沼津市のオフィスグルーが運営するオリジナルこいのぼり製作チーム「ミセスミシン」が、きぶな型のこいのぼり「きぶなのぼり」を製作している。
これを機により一層の浸しみをもってもらおうと９月２７日を「黄ぶなの日」として活動もはじまった。（きぶな欄内記念日を参照）
宇都宮市立南図書館では、図書館での長期滞在による感染拡大を防止する観点から、職員が選んだおすすめの本をセットにした「きぶなぶっく!」を準備した。しかし図書館は臨時休館を余儀なくされた。一方、きぶなへの関心の高まりから、図書館が所蔵する立松和平著の絵本『黄ぶな物語』への注目も高まった。貸し出しが不可能なため、『黄ぶな物語』を朗読する動画を映画監督の安孫子亘が撮影し、南図書館が配信することになった。
宇都宮市の宗教界では、光琳寺が2020年（令和2年）9月よりきぶなを描いたお守りの配布を開始し、宇都宮二荒山神社では9月12日からきぶなをあしらった御朱印の頒布を開始した。その後12月には黄ぶなデザインのお守りも授与している。光琳寺はお守りから得られた収益を医療従事者への寄付や前年の台風19号の復旧義援金に充てるとしている。このほか、宮の市実行委員会は同会が主催する宮の市が中止になった代わりの事業としてうつのみや表参道スクエアに「黄ぶな大明神」と称する神社を期間限定で設置した。2023年現在黄ぶな大明神はうつのみや表参道スクエア2階宇都宮観光コンベンション協会に設置されている。

記念日
2021年(令和3年)9月27日。語呂合わせで９(き)２７(ぶ)(な)。医療従事者の方への日頃の感謝を含め,宇都宮民話伝承,歴史伝承周知の日として『黄ぶなの日』を設け街の活性化に繋げる商業イベントを開催している。
　賛同する商店街が大きな黄ぶなのフラッグを掲げる他、各賛同するお店が新生活様式を用いてコロナ感染対策を徹底した上、黄ぶなの日に合わせて、オリジナルイベントを開催。今泉八坂神社でも活動に賛同し「黄ぶなの日」限定御朱印を授与した。
2022年(令和4年)には、「#黄ぶな運動」や「『黄ぶなの日』記念日制定」発案者でもある関口慶介氏(この他宇都宮二荒山神社の御用達看板も発案している)を中心に、宇都宮市内の商店や神社仏閣,商店街や団体で構成された『黄ぶな推進協議会』が設立された。
翌年2023年(令和5年)4月14日。黄ぶな推進協議会は一般社団法人日本記念日協会の中で初の郷土玩具記念日として認定を受けている。

行基の地図作成伝説
現存する「行基図」には“行基菩薩”作と記されているものが多いが、六国史や仏教史書では行基による地図作成については触れていない。また、最古の「行基図」は、延暦24年（805年）に下鴨神社に納められたものであるとされているが、現存しているものは江戸時代の書写であり、内容も明らかに延暦年間当時の状況の反映でない（延暦期にはなかった加賀国が記載されている）。
そもそも行基が生きていた時代の「行基図」が実在するならば、都は大和国平城京（数年の例外はあっても）にあったのだから、大和国を中心とした地図の筈であるが、こうした地図は見つかってはいない。このため、本当に行基が地図を作ったのかを疑問視し、「後世の人々が作者を行基に仮託したのが伝説化したものではないか」とする見方もある。
なお、中世に成立した『渓嵐拾葉集』に引用された『行基菩薩記』には、「行基が全国を回ったことで諸国の境界が定まって開墾が進み、行基がその結果を図にして日本を独鈷の形で描いたことで仏法が栄えた」とする伝承を載せている。

中世における行基図
前述のように最古の行基図とされているのは、延暦24年作成と伝えられているが、原図は既になく、現在伝わるものは江戸時代の有職故実研究家藤貞幹（藤井・藤原とも、1732年－1797年）の写しのものであり、かつ延暦24年の実情と不一致の加筆が見られる（これが藤貞幹によるものか、それ以前からのものなのかは不詳）。
大治3年（1128年）に三善為康が書いたものを原典として鎌倉時代にまとめられたとされる『二中歴』や南北朝時代に洞院公賢により書かれたとされる『拾芥抄』にも行基図が添付されているが、書かれた当時のものは残っておらず、現存のものは室町時代以後のものである。
現存しかつ最古のものは鎌倉時代の嘉元3年（1305年）の銘がある京都仁和寺所蔵の『日本図』でありこちらは西日本の部分が欠けている。また同時期に他の所有者の地図から転写されたと推定されている称名寺所蔵（神奈川県金沢文庫保管）のものであるがこちらは東日本の部分が欠けている。両者は大きく違い別系統に属すると考えられ、前者は典型的な行基図の体裁であるが、後者は元寇以後の軍事的緊迫下にある鎌倉近郊で用いられた事情を反映したものか、日本列島は龍らしき生物に囲まれてその外側に唐土・蒙古などの海外の国々や雁道・羅刹国などの空想上の国々が描かれている。
東日本および西日本が揃っているもので最古のものは14世紀半ば作と見られる『日本扶桑国之図』（にほんふそうこくのず）があり、2018年（平成30年）6月16日に広島県立歴史博物館が公表したものである。
戦国時代の弘治3年（1557年）に描かれたとされる『南贍部洲大日本国正統図』（伝香寺旧蔵、現唐招提寺所蔵）は、日本地図の周辺の外枠に郡名などの情報が記載されている。この図あるいは同一スタイルの地図が江戸時代の行基図の基本となっていく。また、この時代には屏風絵の背景などにも行基図が採用された。安土桃山時代の作とされる福井県小浜市発心寺の屏風絵などがその代表作である。
なお、室町時代以後に行基図が朝鮮半島や中国、遠くヨーロッパまでも伝わって、日本地図を描く時の材料にされたといわれている（『海東諸国記』・『日本一鑑』など）。

江戸時代の行基図
江戸時代に入ると、印刷技術の発達により大量印刷された行基図が登場する。その殆どが『拾芥抄』あるいは『南贍部洲大日本国正統図』の系統をひく地図だが、社会の安定に伴う交通の発達で、より実際の日本地図に近い地形が描かれるようになった。慶安・承応・明暦年間に刊行された行基図が現在も残されている。
だが『正保日本図』刊行以後、交通手段や測量技術の発達などにより、より緻密な日本地図が作成・刊行されるようになり、行基図は実用利用・商業出版の場からは姿を消していった。
もっとも教育・芸術分野では、行基図が後々までに使われてきた。文政年間の九谷焼や天保年間の伊万里焼などに描かれた行基図付の「地図皿」は日本国外にも輸出された。

概要
所在地：京都市 下京区 綾小路通西洞院東入新釜座町728京都・四条通を南の綾小路通りへ少し下がった路地に民家の軒下に埋め込まれるように祀られている。所在する新釜座町の地は、平安時代当時は左京五条三坊一保一町の町中であったが、後には 太政大臣・藤原頼忠の四条宮となった。その後再び町屋になったという、市内でも古い町である。2010年（平成22年）2月に行われた改修工事以前は、民家軒下の壁が路地にせり出しており、上部には格子の中に古い廚子が納められ、下部には壁の中に石が塗りこまれていた。その後、祠は民家の中に移設され、下部にあった石と共に祀られるようになった。

歴史
築土神社が祀られた頃、当時“市聖”とあがめられていた高僧の空也上人は京の都において、将門の首が晒された地に堂を建て手厚く供養したという。いつしか「空也供養の道場」と呼ばれるようになり、後にこれがクウヤクヨウ…がなまってコウヤク、細い路地に位置することから“膏薬の辻子（こうやくのずし）”として地名になったと伝わっている。明治2年に南北に分かれていた膏薬辻子を合併し、現在の町名（新釜座町）に変えられるまではこの名で呼ばれていた。江戸時代の地誌類にはいくつかに掲げられている。『京雀』「かうやくの辻子」のくだりには「又此町の南にて行當神田明神の社有」と記載されている。 『拾遺都名所図会〜巻一〜』においても「天慶3年に平将門の首を晒したところであり、それよりこの地に家を建てると祟りがある」「空也上人は将門の亡霊をここに供養し、石を建てて印とした」という内容が書かれている。 明治に入ってからの、『京都日出新聞』では将門の首塚を発見したという記事が載ったが、大正初年の『京都坊目誌』には将門との縁を否定する文が残されている。ここが東京の神田明神の本家であるという説もあるが、裏付ける資料は見つかっていない。

交通アクセス
四条烏丸（南西角）を西方面へ進み、四条通南側新町と西洞院の間の路地を入った先に所在する。京都市営地下鉄烏丸線 四条駅より徒歩6分、阪急京都本線 烏丸駅 26番出口より徒歩5分ほどの距離にある。
市バス「四条西洞院」より徒歩1分。路地を入り、史蹟将門塚保存会の幟が立てられているのが目印。

源義経が師事した流派という伝説もあり、様々な人物伝や伝記などの伝承がある。

歴史・伝承
源義経
九郎判官・源義経は京に生まれ、幼少期に鞍馬寺において剣術を学んだとされる。この義経が学んだ流派が京八流、またはその一派ではないかと言われる。義経の剣術は「敏捷性を生かし、短い刀を用いて素早く敵の懐に入る剣術」だったとされ、義経が源平合戦において実際に使用したとされる車太刀は短く（53cm）反りの大きい刀であり、義経の剣術が伝承通りであった事をうかがわせるものである。

念流
兵法三大源流の一つとされる「念流」を創始した念阿弥慈恩は禅宗の僧であり、京の鞍馬山で修行して剣の技を極めた。
鞍馬山で「異形の人」と出会い剣術の妙技を教わったとされるために、「念流」は「奥山念流」あるいは「判官流」と呼ばれ、京八流の流れを汲む剣術とも言われる。

中条流
室町時代に中条長秀が京で創始した「中条流」は「中条家伝来の剣術」と上記の「念流」を合わせて完成した剣術である。中条流は短い太刀（小太刀）を重用する流派ということで、古くから源義経の剣術との類似が指摘されており、また「中条家伝来の剣術」が京八流の末流という説がある事と、「念流」にも鞍馬山との関係が見受けられることから中条流こそ京八流の直系流派であるという考察がある。中条流は後の一刀流、冨田流（戸田流、當田流、巌流）など、多くの有名流派の母体となり、また中条流の系譜には鐘捲自斎、伊藤一刀斎、佐々木小次郎などの有名剣豪が連なることから、中条流が京八流の末流だとする伝承は大いに学者の興味を湧き立たせる。

京流
「山本勘助」は甲斐国の武田信玄に仕えた軍師であるが、彼の使った剣術・兵法は「京流」とされている。これが京八流であるかは定かではないが、彼の剣技の腕前については次のような記述がある。

「天文17年（1548年）に南部下野守が家臣の石井藤三郎を成敗しようとして失敗。この藤三郎を勘助が心張り棒を使って倒し下野守に引き渡した。」
 - 甲陽軍鑑

おそらく新当流を修め、かつ真剣を持った藤三郎を棒で倒した技術は見事であり、逸話が事実ならこの「京流」は優れた剣術であったことが分かる。また、同じく武田信玄に仕えた軍師「前原筑前守」も「京流」の達人とされる。

「上野先方侍である前原筑前守は剣術・京流の達人で、投げられた複数の扇子を続けざまに切り落とすなど優れた剣の腕を持つ」
 - 本朝武芸小伝

これらの文献には「京流」が明確に登場しているが、この「京流」は「京八流」の一派なのか、上記の「中条流」のような京の剣術全般を指しているのかは定かではない。

吉岡流
吉岡憲法直元が創始した吉岡流も、京八流の末流という説がある、吉岡流の剣士としては江戸時代初期に宮本武蔵と争った吉岡清十郎、吉岡伝七郎が有名であるが、当の吉岡一門が断絶しており、文献が残されていない。

その他
その他、鞍馬流、義経流などが京八流に源流を持つとされるが、文献が消失しており関係性は不明である。
以上のように、京八流及びその系譜とされる剣術のほとんどは近世以降に失伝しているが、「剣術の源流」「始祖が鬼一法眼」という京八流の伝承は広く親しまれており、現代に至るまでさまざまな演劇や文学作品、漫画作品などの設定に用いられている。
また、六衛府（左右兵衛府、左右近衛府、左右衛門府）、大宰府、多賀城府の８府での武術という説もある。

概略
石切川の水源をなす山中にあった。
住民は京都から世を避けて隠れ住んだ、藤原左衛門佐という者の子孫であるといい、全員が藤原姓であったが、これは山村の神人の家に例が多い。最後の住人であった藤原忠教が死去した後は無住集落となっている。
京丸という地名は京人が住むからであるという。
「掛川志」には、遠江奥山郷について「御料の地であつて、三年毎に上番をした、仕丁一人ありこれを京夫丸といふ」とあるので、一説に奥山郷に隣接する京丸は、京夫丸の転訛であるという。
貴人が隠棲した地であり、それは平家の残党であるとか、後醍醐天皇、あるいは宗良親王であるとかいい、応永年間の「浪合記」その他の記述からは、遠江、三河などの山地に伝わる尹良親王と関係があるという。
里おさの屋敷の結構、阿弥陀堂に伝わる親鸞上人筆と称される画像、葬式に僧侶がおらず阿弥陀の画像を導師とすること、などから仙境の地であるとされた。
葬式に阿弥陀の画像を導師とするのは、周智郡内の山村、三河、飛騨などでも行なわれた。
柳里恭「雲萍雑志」には、浜松から「十五里ほど山に入れば、遠江と信濃の国のさかひなる川そひの地に、京丸と呼ぶところあり、その地は他より人の行きかふべきところにもあらず、国の境に、藤の蔓もて長さ五六十間もあらんとおもふほどの桟をかけたり、その地は家わづかに四五軒ありて、農の業はすれども、常の食は米は聊かも食はで、稗にあづきをまじえて粮とす」とある。
西村白烏「煙霞綺談」には、ボタンについて「険阻なる山のはらに大木二本あり、遠く見渡すところ、一本は凡そ四囲、一本は二囲ほどにて、初夏に花を発く、其色白く径尺ばかりに見ゆる、外に類すべきものなく、牡丹なりしといへり、古しへ内裏の跡にて、其時の花壇なりと土俗いひ伝へり」とある。
文献としては、「遠江風土記伝」、「秉穂録」、「煙霞奇談」、「遠山奇談」、「東海道名所図会」、「遠山著聞集」、曲亭馬琴の「山牡丹」など諸書に言及、記述があるが、そのほとんどは伝聞である。

京丸牡丹伝説
遠州七不思議の１つとして京丸牡丹という物語がある。
昔、村に迷いこんだ若者と、村の娘が恋に落ちた。が、村には里人以外と婚姻してはならないという掟があり、悲嘆した二人は大きなボタン（牡丹）に変じたのだという。
そのボタンが咲くときは遠方からこれを認めることができ、落花が渓流を流れて来るという。
ボタンは文献によってその花の色は異なり、また、7年、10年、また60年毎に咲くともいう。
京丸集落の住人であった藤原忠教は大正２年頃この巨大牡丹を見たと証言しているが、現地住民の間では一種のシャクナゲを誤認したのであろうといわれている。

沿革
明治初年の時点では、幕府領の小俣京丸村の一部であった。
1889年（明治22年）4月1日 - 町村制の施行により、小俣京丸村を含む5村が合併し、周智郡気多村が成立。
1957年（昭和32年）8月1日 - 周智郡春野町と気多村が合併し、春野町となる。
2005年（平成17年）7月1日 - 春野町が浜松市に編入。

戸隠の九頭龍伝承
戸隠山の九頭龍信仰の源は戸隠神社の九頭龍大神である。鎌倉中期に記された『阿裟縛抄諸寺略記』の中に、西暦800年代の中盤頃の話として、「学門」という名の修行者の法華経の功徳によって、九つの頭と龍の尾を持つ鬼がこの地で岩戸に閉じこめられ、善神に転じて水神として人々を助けたという言い伝えが残されている（調伏善龍化伝承）。その後、九頭龍権現として崇められ雨乞いが行われた。雨と水を司る他、歯痛の治療にも霊験があり、好物の梨を供えると、歯の痛みを取り除いてくれるとされている。また、縁結びの神ともされている。

九頭龍川流域の伝承
白山信仰
詳しくは「白山権現」や「白山信仰」を参照。
白山開山の起源は、十一面観音の化身である九頭竜王が泰澄の前に現れたことによる。また、白山権現は、後述の九頭竜出現伝承にもかかわっている。

黒龍大神信仰の創始
雄略天皇21年（477年）、男大迹王（継体天皇）が越前国の日野、足羽、黒龍の三大河の治水の大工事を行われ、北国無双の暴れ大河であった黒龍川（後の九頭竜川）の守護と国家鎮護産業興隆を祈願され高龗大神（黒龍大神）、闇龗大神（白龍大神）の御二柱の御霊を高尾郷黒龍村毛谷の杜に創祀された。この儀により現代まで連綿と続く九頭竜湖～九頭竜川流域での黒龍大明神信仰が興ったのだとされる。
その後、黒龍大神と白龍大神のうちの前者は、天地の初めから国土を守護してきた四方位を象徴する4柱の神々「四大明神」の一柱を祀るものとされた。東の常陸国には鹿島大明神、南に紀伊国には熊野大権現、西の安芸国には厳島大明神（神宮創建 推古天皇元年{593年}）、北の越前国の当地には黒龍大明神として、日本の国家鎮護 及び 黒瀬川（後の九頭竜川）流域の守護神として祭祀されてきた。
第四十三代元明天皇和銅元年（708年）9月20日、高志連村君（こしのむらじ・むらぎみ）が継体天皇の御遺徳を景仰し、高尾郷黒龍村（毛谷の杜）で御霊を合祀。
延暦3年（784年）8月、社殿が火災で焼失し坂上苅田麻呂（さかのうえのかりたまろ、坂上田村麻呂の父）が再建

九頭竜の出現
寛平元年（889年）6月、平泉寺の白山権現が衆徒の前に姿を現して、尊像を川に浮かべた。すると九つの頭を持った龍が現れ、尊像を頂くようにして川を流れ下り、黒龍大明神の対岸に泳ぎ着いたという。以来、この川を「九頭龍川｣と呼ぶようになった。

その後の黒龍大明神信仰の歴史
承平元年（931年）、藤原利行 朱雀帝御宇承平元年越前国黒龍村、毛谷神社神職となる（藤原姓の神職の祖、第一代）。
承平3年（933年）、長者となった生江の世常の宿祢（いくえのよつねのすくね）の夢にお告げがあり、社殿を新しく造りかえた。毎年七度の祭礼が行われてきたという。それが延喜式にある坂井郡毛谷神社で、今の毛谷黒龍神社にあたる。生江の世常の宿祢が長者となる奇跡の物語は、今昔物語集［巻17-47］や宇治拾遺物語［巻15-7］に載っている。
光明院御宇暦応元年5月2日、二十四代藤原行古が左中将義貞に従軍し藤島の里に戦死。暦応元年5月、新田義貞が斯波高経と戦ったとき、 黒龍神社も兵火にかかり燃える。このとき神霊は、白龍となって山上に飛び、木の上にとまった。そこで、このあたりを竜ヶ岡（たつがおか）と呼ぶようになった（『太平記』巻第二十に黒龍明神下での戦いの記載あり）。

鹿野山の九頭龍伝承
千葉の鹿野山麓の鬼泪山（きなだやま）には、九頭龍という九つの頭を持つ巨大な大蛇が棲みつき、村人を襲い人々を喰らったという伝承がある。
村の長が都に使いをたて大蛇退治を願い出たところ、日本武尊（ヤマトタケルノミコト）が大蛇退治に遣わされた。
村人がその恐ろしさをタケルに語ると、タケルは腰の剣を抜き「必ず この草薙剣で大蛇を退治してみせる」と誓い、村人の案内で小川沿いの道を鬼泪山に分け入った。
タケルは懸命に九頭龍を探すが一向に見つからない。疲れ果てていつしかタケルは眠ってしまった。するとそこに九頭龍が現れ、タケルを一飲みにしてしまった。
三日ほど経ったある日。村の娘が小川で洗濯をしていると、だんだんと川の澄んだ水が赤く染まっていった。娘はあまりのことに驚き、村人を呼んだ。「タケルノミコト様が大蛇を退治してくださったからに違いない」「いやもしかしたら、タケルノミコト様の身に･･･」などと話し合っていると、ヤマトタケルノミコトが現れて「つい油断して九つの頭の蛇に一呑みにされてしまった。幸いにも生きていたので 約束どおり この剣を抜き、奴の腹の中を滅多斬りに切り裂いて、外へ出られた。そして、九つの頭を全部切り落としてやった」と言った。
このとき流れ出た血が、鬼泪山北麓を流れる川を三日三晩染めたので、今でもその川のことを「（血）染川」と呼んでいる。なお、退治された九頭龍の霊魂は長年を通じて供養され、「九頭竜権現」として祀られるに至り、今でも神野寺仁王門に鎮座されている。また、鹿野山測地観測所の下には「大蛇作」「蛇堀」などと呼ばれる場所がある。かつて大蛇の棲息していた場所だという。

龍ではなく、鬼泪山に篭って日本武尊と闘ったのは、鬼とされた阿久留王だったという伝承もある。別名、六手王とも言った。また、鬼が泣いて許しを請うたので「鬼泪山」という呼称がついたことにもなっている。阿久留王の墓という祠が江戸期までは実在したと言われている。
鬼泪山でヤマトタケルと闘ったのは、でいだく坊、だいだあ法師、デーデッポ、だいだらぼっちという巨人であったという伝承もある。

箱根の九頭龍伝承と祭祀
九頭龍神社（本宮、ほんぐう）の縁起は、箱根神社（箱根権現）と同じ天平宝字元年（757年）に、箱根神社を開いた万巻上人が、芦ノ湖の龍が暴れているのを調伏し守護神として祀ったとされる神社である。
芦ノ湖がまだ万字ヶ池と呼ばれていた奈良時代以前、箱根の村には、毎年若い娘を選んで芦ノ湖に棲む毒龍に人身御供として差し出すという慣習があった。箱根山で修行中の万巻上人が、このことを知ると、法力で毒龍を改心させて村人たちを救うと決意した。万巻上人は湖畔で経文を唱え毒龍に対して人身御供を止めるように懇々と仏法を説いた。ついに毒龍は宝珠・錫杖・水瓶を携えた姿で湖から出現すると、過去の行いを詫びた。それでも万巻上人は毒龍を許さず、鉄鎖の法を修して龍を湖底の「逆さ杉」に縛り付け、仏法を説き続けた。龍は、もう悪事はせず、地域一帯の守り神になる旨を約束をする。万巻上人は龍の約束が堅いことを知り、九頭龍大明神としてこの地に奉ることにした。その満願の日とは6月14日（旧暦）。そのため九頭龍神社（本宮）の祭りは、毎年6月13日が例大祭、毎月の13日が月次祭である。毎年7月31日には「湖水祭」も行われている。また、箱根神社の境内にある九頭龍神社新宮の月次祭は、毎月15日に行われている。箱根の九頭龍大明神は水神であるとともに、商売繁盛や縁結びの御利益があるとされている。
今でも芦ノ湖の湖水祭では、人身御供に代えて赤飯を湖に捧げている。赤飯の入ったお櫃を御供船に載せ、逆さ杉のところで湖底に沈めるのである。このお櫃が浮かび上がってくると、龍神が人身御供を受け入れなかったとされ、災いが起きると言われている。

九頭龍神社新宮（しんぐう）
平成12年（2000年）に九頭龍神社（本宮）の御祭神を分霊してお迎えし、箱根神社境内に建立した。箱根神社拝殿のすぐ隣にある。
神霊的には新宮の御祭神は、本宮と同一である。

安産杉
箱根神社の境内には、九頭龍神社新宮の隣に「安産杉」がある。箱根の九頭龍はこのため安産の神としても有名になった。鎌倉時代に、源頼朝が箱根神社に安産の祈願をしたところ、3代将軍源実朝が無事誕生したとされ、以後、安産の祈願を箱根神社に行う風習が広まったとされる。

発掘された平城京の二条大路木簡には、奈良の南山に住む九頭一尾の大蛇に疫病（天然痘）の原因となる鬼を食べて退治してもらい、都での流行阻止を祈願したとされる文が書かれている。ここでは人を害するものではなく、病気を食べる利益をもたらすものとして扱われている。

唐の時代の医学書「千金翼方」にも、熱病治療の時に唱えられていた呪文「禁瘧鬼法」の一つとして同様の呪文が書かれている。しかし、「千金翼方」の文において、二条大路木簡の「一大蛇九頭一尾」に対応する部分は「地中有蟲、赤頭黄尾（地中に住む虫（蛇）有り、赤い頭で黄色い尾を持つ）」となっており、九頭とは記されていない。

三井寺の霊泉と九頭龍大神
近江国三井寺（園城寺）金堂の近くには天智天皇・天武天皇・持統天皇の三帝が産湯に用いたという霊泉が湧いている。この霊泉は「御井（みい）」と呼ばれ、「御井の寺」から三井寺の通称となった。その霊水は、古より閼伽水として金堂の弥勒菩薩に御供えされてきた。
この御井の霊泉には九頭一身の龍神が住んでおられる、と今に伝わる。その九頭龍神は、年に十日の間、深夜 丑の刻に姿を現して、黄金の御器を用い水花を金堂の弥勒菩薩まで供えに来られるという。そのため、その期間は泉のそばを通らない仕来たりであった。近づいたり、覗いて見るなどの行為は、「罰あり、とがあり」と言われ禁じられてきた。

猪名川・五月山一帯の九頭龍伝承
久々知妙見宮は清和源氏の祖、源満仲（または多田満仲 912年? - 997年）が開基したと伝わる妙見宮である。
天徳元年（957年）源満仲が矢文を放ったところ、岩に当たった。その岩を矢文石と名付けて、その地に北辰星（妙見宮）を祀ったと伝わる。その後、天禄元年（970年）摂津の国守に任ぜられたとき、源満仲が新しい館をどこに築こうか思い悩み、同国一の宮の住吉大社に参籠した。参籠して二十七日目、『北の空に向って矢を射よ。その矢のとどまる所を居城とすべし』との神託を受けて、満仲は鏑矢を放った。家来を引き連れた満仲は、空高く五月山を越え放たれた矢を追いながら鼓ヶ滝付近まで来た時、白髪の老人に出会い、矢の落ちた場所を知ることが出来た。この場所は「矢を問うたところ」として、『矢問（やとう）』という地名で残っている。
満仲が老人に教えられた場所に行ってみると、河水をたたえた湖（沼）があり、その湖の主の九つの頭をもった雌雄二頭の大蛇（九頭龍）の内の一頭の大蛇大龍の目に射た矢が刺さり、暴れまわっていた。一頭はこの地で死に血水跡はまるで紅の河のようになって流れた。もう一頭は死に物狂いに山を突き破り飛び出し、湖水は鼓を打つような音をたてて滝となって流れ出た。龍はしばらく鼓ヶ瀧の滝壷の中で生きていたが大水害の度に鶯の森、（川西市）天王宮と下流域に流されて行き、ついに昇天した。後に、その地には12以上も鳥居の立ち並ぶ白龍神社が建立され祀られることとなる。湖沼の水は干き、よく肥えた土地が残り、多くの田畑ができることとなった。そのため 後に「多田」という地名が付けられる。村人らは九頭龍の犠牲の御陰で田畑が拓かれたことをいたく感謝し、九頭龍大明神、九頭龍大権現、白龍大神と崇め御祀りした。満仲は、この地に居城を築き多田源氏を名乗った。
少なくとも1988年までは、上記の九頭龍が死んだ場所として「九頭死（くずし）」という地名が残っていた。現在は「寿久井の地蔵尊」という地名の付近。
兵庫県川西市の九頭神社は、九つの霊石を御祀りして首から上の病に効く神として信仰され頭痛歯痛眼の病等の平癒に効くと伝えられる。最近は、こっそりと「頭の良くなるように」と祈る若者の御参りもあるという。

阿蘇山 宝池の九頭龍神
九州・英彦山に伝え残されている書『彦山流記』の原文をここで紹介する。

この文章は、奥付にあたるところに「建保元年（1213年）癸酉七月八日九州肥前国 小城郡牛尾山神宮寺法印権大僧都谷口坊慶舜」がある。この中でも、仏教的な九頭龍伝承が語られている。
以下、同書よりの意訳はこうなる。
大巌窟で千日の伏臥修行の後、諸法は皆 空である旨をその石室で観じた。かの釈尊が菩提樹で悟ったように。その修めをもって臥験という名となった。
臥験はやがて九州の肥後国は阿蘇の峰に登り、山の嶺嶽をもって法華経にある七宝の（塔の相を顕す）場所となっており、高い峯が四（方に広がる波羅蜜への）門の扉となって開き、そびえていることを理解した。八功徳の水は池に清潔さをもって澄みわたり、自ら五色の波をたて広がっていた。そのさざなみは四波羅蜜、三解脱門を備えており、奏で出されていた。南山に落ちる夕日の光が湖池の浜を金色に染め上げ、銀色の砂が敷詰められる。樹木の間に間に花の色が重なり交わり、極楽浄土の如き荘厳さを呈していた。般若宝珠なる信心堅固な至誠を捧げ、凡夫の決して見ることは出来ないこの宝池の主に拝することを心から願い経を誦した。法華経の第三巻目に達する前に、まず鷹が現れた。しかし、「小鳥の王でこの宝池の主に相応しくない」と言って退けた。更に俗人・僧侶・竜が現れては、その一つ一つを池の主ではないと退けた。そして、十一面観音が現れ光明が赫々と輝くに至った。それでも、池の主ではないと退け、さらに経を唱え続けた。
臥験は半月にも及んであえなく見る物事が無かった。そのとき、修法に従事していた 池の中から声があって 臥験に告げ言う。
「宝池において、主の正体を汝が拝むことあたわず。罪障が重いゆえなり」と言う。
臥験は大いに激して言った。「我は是 三界を領有し治める知識や学問を身につけた聖なる持明者である。悪魔降伏を信じて疑わない。八大童子が随う十二神将よ加護し給え。第六天魔王をなお繋ぎ縛れ。何者が余の状況を評してかように言うか。」と。臥験は経論章疏の要文を誦し、秘密真言や神咒を唱え、邪も正も一如であると念を凝らし観じて真俗二諦の法理を修める間、山は動き地は騒ぎ 四方は悉く長い夜の闇の如くになった。
そして、ついに九頭八面の大龍が出現するに至った。その龍は阿蘇の山のように高く嶺のように長く、それぞれの顔面には三つの目が春の太陽のように出て、あるいは暁の星（金星）の如く照り輝いていた。龍の口から吐かれる大炎は同じく迦楼羅焔の如く照るのだった。その身は虚空をうめて満ち満ちるほどの巨大さだった。
その気迫は大風の如く勢いをもっていた。龍に呑まれると思い、法力を込めて持っている金剛杵を大龍の顔にある三つの眼をめがけて打ち込んだ。すると、龍は姿を消し、四方はあまねく晴れ渡った。
臥験は、池の主に会う願いを達したと思い、山を下りにかかる。すると、蒼天 にわかに かき曇り、大雨となり、川は洪水と化した。臥験は川を渡れなくなったので、山中の他の道を探すことにした。ようやく一軒の小屋が見つかったところ、そこには一人の若い女性がいるのだった。臥験は、泊めてくれるよう頼むと、快く承諾された。
臥験が裸になって濡れた着物を乾かそうとしていると、その年若い女性は、裸の臥験に自分の着物を着せようとした。臥験は、修行の身にとって女性は不浄であるから、その着物は羽織れない旨を言い 彼女の好意を断った。すると、女性は怒って「仏様は慈悲平等の心を教えていて、浄、不浄などを言いません」と言い、臥験が断るのを無理に着せようとした。そうこうしている間に臥験に欲心が起こった。まだ知らない男女の交わりを試そうと女性を押さえつけた。女性は抵抗して、「まず口を吸って接吻してください」と懇願した。しかし、臥験は「自分は日夜、口で秘密真言を唱える身だから、それはできない」と言う。しかし、女性は「それでは目的が達せられないでしょう」と言うので、しかたなく口を吸った途端、舌を噛み切られた。臥験は気絶してその場に倒れた。女性は大竜となって天に昇っていった。臥験が意識をとりもどして辺りを見ると、女性も家も自分の舌までもなく、山中に独り取り残されていた。
臥験は犯した罪を悔い、不動明王に念じて「舌を元通りにならしめ給え」と一心に念じていると、14～5歳くらいの童子が出てきて臥験の舌を撫でた。すると舌は元通りとなり、心身ともに安らかになった。
そのとき天空の高みより声があった。「我は、汝が修法を施したことに対して、汝が妙に思うとも種々の身に形を現した。（女性が汝の身体に良かれと思って衣をかけようとしたのと同様に）真実の正しい身体というものには、極楽世界では阿弥陀という衣を被っている。この娑婆世界では十一面観音という衣を被っている。再び（阿蘇に）登り 重ねて御嶽を拝すべし 宝の身体（躰）を」と仰るのだった。
臥験は、ただちに御岳に登る。また、天空より声がして言う。「汝の修法によって楽々示された種々の身形を観ても、眼根・心根に障りがあるから本地を見抜くことができないのだ」と。臥験は、その場に重ねて座し印を結び凝らしてただ無性に懺悔の意を尽くした。
「霊峯の頂で十一面観自在尊が千の葉の蓮花に坐し 自ずから放たれる大光明に臥験が照らされたあの瞬間、かの光明は十方世界を遍く照らし、三十二相八十種好を具足奉る金色相（こんじきそう）と一つとなり音楽・芸術・美を司る畢婆迦羅の神の身体そのものとなっていた。先ず現れた鷹の身のことを言うと、是は霊山において会い法華経が説かれる時の同聞衆の身形である。次に示された俗な身形を示した者、是は健磐龍命（タケイワタツノミコト、阿蘇大明神）なり。次に僧の身形を示した者、是は比叡山座主良源（912年 - 985年）、次に現れた龍身は、この宝池の主として契りの無い池の大龍なり。最後に現れた十一面観音が当山の峯に常に住まわれる本尊で、大慈大悲の大御心で衆生に利益を与えんとする実体なり。汝の眼に罪障があるから実体を見ぬくことができなかったのだ。」
臥験は心から歓喜踊躍し礼の意を表して、その場を去った。九頭の龍から若い女性、そして天空からの声として現れた此の大龍者こそ、法華経に説かれている同聞衆、娑伽羅龍王、阿那婆達多羅龍王第三王子である。是すなわち十一面観音の化身である。

葛城二十八宿 犬鳴山の奇瑞譚
役の小角が大阪葛城山系の山々の峰に法華経二十八品をそれぞれ二十八箇所に埋めたという伝説がある。その法華経に登場する仏教の守護神・八大竜王が葛城山の山頂に祀られており、八大竜王の4番目に数えられる和修吉こと九頭龍大神が葛城山に連なり法華経第八品が埋宝されている犬鳴山内の九頭龍神社で 今も正式に祀られている。
宇多天皇の御世（887年 - 897年）の義犬伝説により名付けられた犬鳴山。その山に坐す七宝瀧寺。中興の祖・見滝上人が寛文10年（1670年）この犬鳴山普住の際、役の小角の勧請による 本尊 倶利伽羅大竜不動明王に奉告、勤行のため本堂へ向かわれている時の事だった。天空に向かって昇りゆく黒竜と白竜、二柱の竜王の類いまれなる瑞祥を目撃した。上人は深く感動、感激されこの二竜を山の護法神として格別に神明大権現の御神号を呈し奉り祭祀された。爾来発達繁昌を念ずる参拝者の絶えることがなかったという。また、いつの頃からか頭部を癒す神、中風除けの守護としても霊験ありと崇信さられるようになった。
このように葛城山～犬鳴山は数々の伝承で彩られている。

上記以外
青森県十和田神社にも九頭龍伝説が伝わっている。熊野で修行した南祖坊が鉄の草鞋と錫杖を神から授かり「百足の草鞋が破れた所に住むべし」と夢を見て諸国をめぐり、十和田湖畔でちょうど百足めの草鞋が尽きた。当時、十和田湖には八郎太郎というマタギが湖の岩魚や水を喰らううちに八頭の大蛇となり湖を支配していた。南祖坊はその霊験により「九頭龍」に変化し二十尋（約36ｍ）の身体を十曲（とわだ）に曲げ八郎太郎を退治。その南祖坊を青龍権現として崇め祀ったのが今の十和田神社なのだという。
山梨県北杜市の来福寺にある九頭竜の祠は、洪水時に体を横たえて家屋が流れるのを防いだ蛇を祀ったとも、山津波の際福井から分祀したともいわれる。
長野県上田市の別所温泉には九頭竜の伝承が存在し、当地の「岳の幟」は1504年の大干ばつ時に九頭竜権現にお願いしたところから始まっている。「岳の幟民話」でも有名である。
東京都檜原村では南朝側の守護神である九頭龍大神を武運のため氏神として、東京都檜原都民の森近辺に存在する九頭龍神社で祀っている。神社の下流の南秋川には九頭竜の滝、竜神の滝が続いている。

仏教との関連
仏教における九頭竜はヴァースキ（和修吉）である。シェーシャ（Śeṣa）と同一視されることもあり、須弥山を守るとされる。
仏教とともに中国に伝わった際に、ヴァースキは八大竜王の和修吉竜王となり九頭一神の龍となった。これが日本に伝わり、後に神仏習合されると、九頭竜は仏教と神道を守る神となる。八大竜王は密教の信仰であり、現世利益を強く求める密教において九頭竜は雨乞いをつかさどる神となった。日本の九頭竜が九頭竜権現と呼ばれる場合の本地仏は弁才天ないし前述の和修吉竜王である。

甲府市国玉町（くだまちょう）付近を流れる濁川に架かっていた小さな石橋（現存しない）にまつわる橋姫伝説で、江戸時代の甲府勤番士の日記である『裏見寒話』に記されている。

内容
濁川に架かる国玉の大橋の神は嫉妬深い女神で、橋を通行する人が同じ郡（山梨郡）内に架かる猿橋（日本三奇橋のひとつ）の噂をしたり、逆に猿橋の上で大橋の噂をする事はタブーであり、その戒めを破ると必ず恐ろしいことが起こると言われていた。
昔、武州より甲州へ来る旅人が猿橋を渡る際、国玉の大橋の悪口を言うと、どこからともなく美しい女性が旅人に近付き、「あなたは甲府まで行かれるのですか」と尋ね、旅人が「そうだ」と答えると、「甲府の国玉の大橋に女の人が立っているので、この手紙をその女の人に届けてください」と、旅人に手紙を手渡した。
旅人は承諾して手紙を預かったが、少々奇妙な話に思い、預かった手紙をこっそり読むと、『この手紙を持参した者を殺せ』と、恐ろしい内容が書いてあった。驚いた旅人は『この手紙を持参した者を殺すな』と手紙を書き直した。
国玉の大橋に着くと、手紙の受け取り主と思われる怒りに満ちた物凄い形相の女性が橋の上に立っていたので、旅人が書き直した手紙を恐る恐る手渡したところ、手紙を読んだ女性は一転して穏やかな顔つきに変わり、旅人に丁重に礼を述べたという。
また、橋を渡る際に女の嫉みを題材とする謡曲『葵上』を謡うと忽ちに道に迷うが、『三輪』を謡うと再び道が明らかになったとも伝える。

伝説の成長
この伝説は久しく伝えられる間に少しずつ変化したものであろう事が指摘されており、『裏見寒話』の後にも、明治20年前後（19世紀末）に編纂された『山梨県町村誌』には猿橋の噂の禁忌を犯せば怪異が起こるという点はそのままであるが、謡曲が『葵上』から『野宮（ののみや）』へと変化している（2曲とも『源氏物語』の六条御息所の妬みを題材とする点は共通する）。
更に明治末年から大正初年（1910年頃）にかけて編まれた『甲斐口碑伝説』になると、ある人が大橋を渡る際に試しにわざと『野宮』の小謡を謡ったところ、橋からやや隔たった所で乳飲み子を抱いた婦人に行き会い、その婦人から足袋のこはぜを掛け直す間子供を抱いて欲しいと頼まれたので、子を抱く代わりにこはぜを掛け直してあげようと身を屈めながらふと婦人を見上げると恐ろしい鬼女の姿に変じていたためにあわてて逃げ帰ったと、産女の説話要素が付加されている。

橋の女神の妬み
国玉の大橋は一説に「大橋」ではなく「逢橋」であったといい、また「行逢橋」とも別称され、『甲斐国志』によれば山梨・巨摩・八代3郡の境界であったという。
この大橋が猿橋を悪む点について、柳田國男は1918年（大正7年）に「橋姫」において冒頭部分で「国玉の大橋」伝説を紹介し、本来的には橋や辻といった交通上の要衝や村落の境界を司る神に対しては外部からの悪神を阻み却ける神威が期待されており、小橋にも拘わらず「大橋」と称されたのもその間の消息を語るものであって、阻却するというその特性が後に他を妬むという風に変化したものであろうし、そこから女性の嫉妬を材とする謡いをも忌むように発展したものであろうと説き、また橋の神には安産や育児を祈願する習いがあり、産女にも同様の効験を示す一面があるので、その影響で産女的内容の伝も付随していたのであろうと説く。
なお、『葵上』（または『野宮』）が道を迷わせるのに対し、それを直す謡いが『三輪』とされている点については、「仔細はまだ分らぬが」と断りつつも、或いは同曲の末尾の「また常闇（とこやみ）の雲晴れて云々」や「その関の戸の夜も明け云々」の詞章に惹かれたものか、との見通しを述べる。

橋梁の消失
甲府市教育委員会によると、国玉の大橋が架橋されていた場所は、濁川と十郎川の合流部付近、今日の国道411号（城東バイパス）に架かる城東大橋南方付近(座標参照)で、すぐ東方に玉諸神社があり、この橋は玉諸神社への参道の役割も担っていたという。江戸期以前の和歌に国玉の大橋の記述があることから、戦国時代以前より橋は存在したと考えられている。橋の長さは江戸時代初期には180間（約330メートル）ほどであったが、幕末頃の記録では45間（約83メートル）に縮小されており、これは架橋地点付近に大きな中州があり、流路変更などにより濁川本流幅員が縮小したことによるという。その後、橋の北側に甲州街道が整備されたことにより、橋の利用者が徐々に減り、水害等で壊れた橋は修復されず放置されるようになり、やがて消失してしまったという。

概要
首切れ馬の伝承は、特定の場所で首切れ馬を見たという短い目撃談と、別の話と合体し比較的長い物語となったものの二種類がある。宮城県、福島県、八丈島、福井県、淡路島、島根県隠岐、愛媛県、高知県幡多郡上村、長岡郡吉野村汗見川、徳島県、島根県など、その伝承地は多岐にわたる。
首切れ馬のディテールは、その名の通り首（頭部）のない馬である。路上に出没し、馬の上には神が乗っているともいう。徳島県の板野郡では人に襲いかかって噛みついたともいわれている。祖谷山の首切れ馬は大晦日や節分に四辻に姿を現したという。石井町ではワシントン・アーヴィングのスリーピー・ホロウの伝説とよく似た話が伝承されており、落武者の霊が騎乗した首のない馬の目撃談は明治期にも発生している。
首無しというのは幽霊によく見られる怪異であり、この首切れ馬についても、かつて死んだ馬や殺された馬が首のない幽霊となって現れるといった伝承がよく見られる。
宮城、福島では、神の乗った首切れ馬が現れる他、馬の首だけが宙を飛び回るとも言われる。
ちなみに、鹿児島県徳之島では、首切牛（くいきりうし）という首の無い牛の伝承がある。

備考
首のない状態で長期間生存した動物の実例として、アメリカの首なし鶏マイクの記録がある。この事例では、首の穴からスポイトで水と餌を与えた結果として、18ヶ月間生存した。
日本以外の首なし馬として、デュラハンが乗る馬もまた、「コシュタ・バワー」と呼ばれる首なしの馬であるとされる。
首なしラバ：神父と内縁関係となった女性が神の呪いで姿を変えられるというブラジルの民話。

概要
室町時代の成立とされる『鞍馬蓋寺縁記』には以下のように記述されている。
鎮守府将軍藤原利仁が時の天皇の宣旨により下野国高蔵山の蔵宗・蔵安を頭目とする1000人の群盗を討伐する時、鞍馬寺に参籠して立願祈誓すると示現があり盗賊を退治することに成功した。そこで毘沙門天像を造顕して開眼供養し、剣を納めた。
『鞍馬蓋寺縁記』での記述は御伽草子『田村の草子』で利仁をモデルとした藤原俊仁が大蛇の倉光・ 喰介（くらみつ・くらえのすけ）を退治する物語の元になったと考えられている。また妻を拐われた俊仁が鞍馬山の毘沙門天から給った剣で陸奥国高山の悪路王を討つ物語の原点ともなった。

御伽草子
日龍丸が7歳のときに御門から「2匹の大蛇を討伐せよ」と大事の宣旨を受けたのが、日龍丸の伯父を名乗る近江国見馴川の倉光・喰介である。日龍丸は家宝の角突弓に神通の鏑矢で大蛇を退治し、将軍の宣旨が下って俊仁将軍と名乗った。
17歳の時に照日御前と契りを結んだことに嫉妬した帝から伊豆へ流罪にされるが、遠流の途中、瀬田の唐橋の上で橋桁を強く踏み鳴らし、退治した倉光・喰介の魂魄に向けて「都に上がって心のままにせよ」と呼びかけ、都に異変を起こさせた。帝が占わせた天文博士が俊仁将軍を都に戻せば鎮まるといったので、俊仁は都に帰ることを許され、大蛇は鎮まった。

『信濃奇勝録』には「岩倉池の龍蛇高梨家（たかなしけ）の息女に掛想（けさう）して不叶其仇（あだ）を報（むくい）む為に水災（さい）をなせし」とある。すなわち、岩倉池に住む竜蛇が高梨氏の姫君に思いを寄せるが実らず、仕返しとして水害をもたらした、というのが物語の大筋である。1917年（大正6年）発行の『日本伝説叢書 信濃の巻』によれば「高梨家の息女」の名を黒姫といい、竜蛇と通じて黒姫山に住むとされる。本書に「岩倉池」の題で収録された物語を要約して以下に記す。

沓野川上流の岩倉池に住む竜蛇は黒姫に思いを寄せ、小姓の姿に化けて姫の元へと通った。こうして姫の気を引き、岩倉池にさらってしまおうと企んでいたが、不審に思った他の小姓に尾行され、ついに正体を知られてしまう。竜蛇は怒り、その小姓に毒を吐きかけて死なせてしまうが、これをきっかけに竜蛇の悪巧みは広く知られるところとなった。
竜蛇は思い通りにならない仕返しに、四十八池の水を落として高梨氏の一族を絶やしてしまおうと企てた。これに気付いた地獄谷の山神は、恩顧のあった高梨氏の人々を守るべく、燃えたぎらせた地獄の火で落ちてくる水を蒸発させてしまった。竜蛇はあわてて水を戻したが、既に遅く、大沼池、岩倉池、琵琶池、ほか4池を満たす程度の水しか残っていなかった。
なお、「沓野川」は『天保国絵図』にも見える川名であるが、現代の地図では「夜間瀬川」に置き換わっている。

『下高井郡誌』・『信濃の伝説』の「黒姫物語」
1922年（大正11年）発行の『下高井郡誌』には「黒姫物語」として収録されている。1925年（大正14年）発行の『信濃の伝説』の「黒姫物語」にも同様の記述が見えるので、要約して以下に記す。

高梨摂津守政盛には、政頼と黒姫という2人の子供がいた。容姿端麗の美人であった黒姫は、政盛の寵愛をその一身に集めていた。そんな黒姫のもとに、狩衣を着た20歳ほどの青年が近付くようになる。家臣たちが彼を捕らえようとするも手に負えず、怒った政盛は自ら姫の寝室の前で待ち構えた。深夜、姿を現した狩衣の青年に対し、政盛は源頼朝から授かった名剣で切りかかった。しかし、刀は狩衣の袖を切っただけで、強い風と立ち上る黒い雲の中に、青年の姿を見失ってしまう。
これ以来、城下は毎晩暴風に見舞われるようになり、町人や百姓の間に不安が広がった。岩倉池の竜が黒姫を慕って近付いたが失敗し、その話を耳にした竜王によって岩倉池から追い出され、さらに城下一帯を湖に変えて移り住もうとしていると噂された。人々が逃げ出す中、黒姫は自身を犠牲にしてでも民衆を救おうと決心した。始めはこれを許さなかった政盛であったが、ある晩夢枕に立った湯殿権現に説得され、泣く泣く姫の外出を認めた。
城を出た黒姫は越後国との境界付近で白髪の翁に出会う。翁は岩倉池の毒蛇がこの山にも移り住もうとしているので、退治するためには黒姫の持つ名剣が必要だと言い、退治した暁にはこの山を姫に与えると告げた。姫は名剣と、自身の黒髪を翁に渡した。翁が池に剣と髪を投げ込むと、池の中に竜蛇の姿が現れた。剣をのみ込んだ竜蛇は倒れ、池の水が赤く染まった。山の方に竜蛇のような黒い雲が起こり、暗闇のなか雷と氷が降ったかと思うと、黒姫の姿は消えてしまった。その山は現在の黒姫山と伝えられている。

『みすゞかる信濃』の「黒姫伝説」
1941年（昭和16年）発行の『みすゞかる信濃』に黒姫伝説に関する記述があるので紹介する。物語の大筋は『下高井郡誌』・『信濃の伝説』の「黒姫物語」とほぼ同様であるが、黒姫の父親を政盛ではなく盛頼としていたり、洪水で黒姫が流されている（直接的な描写はないが、「押し流された黒姫の事を悲んで居つた」という記述が見られる）など、いくつかの相違点がある。

高井郡日野城の高梨政盛には嗣子がなく、2番目の弟である盛頼が後を継いだ。盛頼の長子は政頼、その妹が黒姫である。黒姫は引く手あまたの美人で、高梨氏の親戚である長尾為景（上杉謙信の父親）の勧めで足利義尚（室町幕府第9代将軍）の侍女になる予定であった。
永正3年（1506年）の春、黒姫の寝室に近付く一人の美少年が現れる。報告を受けた盛頼は、その少年を捕らえるよう家臣らに命じるも逃げられてしまう。盛頼は自ら馬に乗って後を追い、名剣で少年の片腕を切り落とした。すると空は嵐となり、30か所余りの池が決壊し、日野城は流されてしまった。噂では、岩倉池・硯川の黒龍が黒姫を慕って通ったものの、名剣によって本来の力を発揮できず、そればかりか傷を負わされてしまったことで竜王の怒りに触れ、岩倉池を追われたうっぷんを晴らそうとしている、ということである。
真山城に撤退した盛頼は、風雨が収まったところで人々の救出策を講じた。領内での酒造りを禁じて米穀を確保するとともに、佐久からも食糧を調達した。政頼は祖先の盛光が信仰したという湯殿山の神社を参拝し、夢のお告げにより黒龍の居場所をつきとめる。一方、盛頼の夢の中には流されたはずの黒姫が現れ、名剣を欲した。黒姫は盛頼から名剣を授かると、山の中の池に潜む黒龍を退治し、そのとき流れた血が赤川となった。その山は黒姫山と呼ばれるようになり、美女が水の上で歌を詠む姿や、雨乞いに応えて雨を降らせるといったことも伝わる。
黒龍の住処とされる「岩倉池・硯川」について、現在の国土地理院の地図を参照しても志賀高原周辺には「岩倉池」を確認することはできないが、「硯川」という川名については熊の湯温泉付近にて確認することができる。

『信濃の民話』の「黒姫物語」
1957年（昭和32年）発行の『信濃の民話』に収録された「黒姫物語」は、中野市中町の綿貫市郎・松谷せつによる話を作家の松谷みよ子が再話したものである。内容を要約して以下に記す。

春、高梨政盛は黒姫と共に家臣を連れて花見に出かけた。盃を上げていると一匹の白蛇が姿を現し、黒姫は政盛に促されて白蛇にも盃を分けてやった。その夜、黒姫のもとに狩衣を着た小姓が現れて求婚する。彼は昼間に姫から盃を頂いた者だといい、その気高く美しい様に、姫も心を惹かれた。
数日後、その小姓は黒姫を嫁にもらおうと政盛のもとを訪ねた。政盛から見ても立派な青年ではあったが、自らを大沼池の主の黒龍であると話す小姓に対し、人間ではないものに黒姫を嫁がせる訳にはいかないと破談にした。それから毎日のように小姓が城を訪ねて来るようになって100日、政盛は小姓に試練を課す。しかしそれは政盛が仕掛けた罠であり、痛めつけられた小姓は正体をさらし、怒って四十八池の水を落とそうと嵐を呼んだ。
黒姫は小姓に酷い仕打ちをした政盛を責め、黒雲に向かって嵐を鎮めるよう叫び、鏡を高く投げ上げた。すると黒龍が姿を現し、黒姫を乗せて駆け上った。洪水で荒れ果てた下界を見て嘆き悲しむ黒姫に、黒龍は許しを乞うた。それから二人は共に山の池へと移り住み、その山は黒姫山と呼ばれるようになった。
松谷は戦時中の疎開先であった中野市に、民話採集を目的として再訪している。当地の老人からは、洪水のなか姫だけが生き残ったという話や、姫がヒョウタンを持って大沼池の竜のもとへ嫁いだという話を聞かされ、彼らはこうした話が黒姫伝説の由来だろうと証言した。また、黒姫は中野祇園祭に合わせて帰省し、たった3粒でも雨を降らせるとも伝わる。水害で苦しめられた経験を多く持つ世代は黒姫を「生けにえ」と捉えているのに対し、若年層は「愛の民話」と捉えており、松谷は黒姫伝説のテーマの移り変わりを感じたという。
この物語は「大沼池の黒竜」の題でテレビアニメ『まんが日本昔ばなし』で放送され、同作のDVD第48巻に収録されている。演出は水沢わたる、文芸は沖島勲、美術は山守正一、作画はスタジオ・アローが担当した。また、テレビアニメ『ふるさと再生 日本の昔ばなし』では「黒姫と竜」の題で2014年（平成26年）7月6日に放送された。

物語
昔、鳥取にお城があった頃、池田の殿様に仕える「桂蔵坊」と名乗る狐がいた。桂蔵坊は若侍に化けるのがうまく、江戸まで3日で行き帰りできるすぐれた術を持っているため、殿様に大変かわいがられていた。
ある時、桂蔵坊は殿様から言いつかった仕事で江戸に出向いた。お城からほど近い百谷の村にさしかかったところ、香ばしいよい匂いがしてくる。ふと見ると道の脇で焼きねずみを罠に仕掛けている百姓がいたので、侍に化けてわけを聞いてみたところ、畑を荒らす狐を退治するために罠を仕掛けているとのことだった。
江戸で用事を済ませた桂蔵坊がその村を通りかかると、あの焼きねずみがよい匂いを放っている。罠が仕掛けられていると知りつつも、匂いに釣られ我慢ができなくなった桂蔵坊は焼きねずみに飛びつき、挟まれて死んでしまった。池田の殿様は桂蔵坊をたいそう哀れがり、お城に中坂神社を造り桂蔵坊を祀ってやったということである。
現在では鳥取県鳥取市の久松山の中坂神社に桂蔵坊が祀られている。

備考
江戸時代後期に著された『鳥府志』（岡嶋正義著）に、桂蔵坊の伝説は池田光仲の代の出来事であるとの言い伝えが紹介されている。
中坂神社は鳥取城登山道の中腹にあり、城の守り神として知られる。
桂蔵坊が罠にかかったのは、播磨国の村という伝承もある。
桂蔵坊の女房は「立見峠のおとんじょろう」であると言われている。桂蔵坊、おとんじょろう、さらに鳥取に伝わる化け狐3匹を加え、計5匹を因幡五狐（いなばごぎつね）という。
「○○坊」という狐の名の例がほかにないことから、「桂蔵坊」は狐ではなく、社を起こした人物の名だとする説もある。
罠のネズミを食べる場面については、狂言の「こんくわい」からの影響が指摘されている。

上田地域の小泉小太郎
小泉小太郎にまつわる民話の大要が1922年（大正11年）発行の『小県郡史 余篇』に収録されているので、以下に要約して紹介する。

西塩田村にある鉄城山の山頂に寺があり、そこへ毎晩のように通う一人の女性がいた。彼女がどこからやって来たのか分からず、不思議に思った寺の住職は、彼女の衣服に糸を付けた針を刺しておいた。翌朝、住職が糸をたどって行き着いた先は、川の上流にある鞍淵の洞窟であった。中をのぞくと、赤子を産もうと苦しむ大蛇の姿があった。住職は驚いて逃げ出し、出産を終えた大蛇も正体が知られたことを恥じて死んでしまう。
赤子は小泉村の老婆に拾われ、小太郎という名前で育てられた。身長は小さいものの、たくましい体に成長した小太郎であったが、食べては遊んでばかりで仕事をしたことがない。14、5歳になった頃、老婆から仕事を手伝うよう促された小太郎は、小泉山へ薪を取りに出かけることにした。
夕方、小太郎は萩の束を2つほど持ち帰った。これは山じゅうの萩を束ねたものだから、使うときは1本ずつ抜き取るようにして、決して結びを解いてはいけない、と小太郎は老婆に伝えたが、たった1日でそのようなことができるはずがないと思った老婆は結びを解いてしまう。すると、束がたちまち膨れあがり、家も老婆も押しつぶしてしまった。
補足として以下に何点か記す。

似たような伝承は日本の各地に見られ、それらの根幹は古事記にある三輪山伝説であると考えられている。
『小県郡史 余篇』によると、寺があるとされる鉄城山は殿城山またはデッチョウ山とも呼ばれ、その支峰が独鈷山であると記されている。のちに再編された作品の中では独鈷山という名前に置き換えられている。
産川という川の名前は、大蛇が赤子を産んだという逸話に由来する。また、産川の流域に散らばる沸石は蛇骨石と呼ばれ、それらは死んだ大蛇の遺骨であるという。
小泉山は、その山じゅうの萩を小太郎が刈り尽くしたため、以来1本も萩が生えなくなったという。とは言え、現代では萩の繁茂が見られるようである。
小太郎とその子孫は当地に永住したが、彼らの横腹には蛇紋のような斑点があるという。
松谷みよ子は塩田平を訪れた際に小泉小太郎の民話を耳にしている。内容は『小県郡史 余篇』にあるものとほぼ同じものであるが、小太郎を出産後に死んだ大蛇の死因は鉄の毒によるものであったという。松谷は小太郎に抱いた怠け者という印象から、物くさ太郎や三年寝太郎、厚狭の寝太郎といった物語を連想し、小太郎も将来大きな事をやってのけるのではないかと考えたが、当地の語り手からは松谷が期待する内容の逸話を得ることはできなかった。

安曇野地域の泉小太郎
長野県安曇野に伝わる民話に泉小太郎（いずみこたろう、日光泉小太郎、泉小次郎とも）がある。かつて安曇野を含む松本盆地は大きな湖で、泉小太郎が陸地に開拓したというものである。
『信府統記』に泉小太郎に関する記述があるので、以下に要約して紹介する。

景行天皇12年まで、（安曇野の対岸にある）松本のあたりは山々から流れてくる水を湛える湖であった。その湖には犀竜が住んでおり、東の高梨の池に住む白竜王との間に一人の子供をもうけた。名前を日光泉小太郎という。しかし小太郎の母である犀竜は、自身の姿を恥じて湖の中に隠れてしまう。
筑摩郡中山の産ヶ坂で生まれ、放光寺で成人した小太郎は母の行方を捜し、尾入沢で再会を果たした。そこで犀竜は自身が建御名方神の化身であり、子孫の繁栄を願って顕現したことを明かす。そして、湖の水を流して平地とし、人が住める里にしようと告げた。小太郎は犀竜に乗って山清路の巨岩や久米路橋の岩山を突き破り、日本海へ至る川筋を作った。
大昔に山清路を人の手で開削して松本盆地を排水、開拓したとする『仁科濫觴記』の記述を根拠に、これを伝説の由来とする説がある。「泉小太郎」の名も、その功労者である「白水光郎」（あまひかるこ）の名が書き誤られたもの（「白」・「水」の2文字を「泉」の1文字に、「光」の1文字を「小」・「太」の2文字にといった具合に）であるという。
民話ゆかりの地である松本市・安曇野市・大町市・長野市には、伝説にちなむ銅像や石像が建立されている。また、大町市の大町温泉郷には泉小太郎を扱う博物館「民話の里おおまち小太郎」がある。

小泉小太郎と泉小太郎との関連
小泉小太郎と泉小太郎との関連について、『小県郡史 余篇』には「内容は異なれど其名称相似たり」とあり、民俗学者の柳田國男も自著『桃太郎の誕生』の中で「元は一つであつたらうことが注意せられる」と指摘している。松谷みよ子は小泉小太郎の民話を聞いたのち、安曇野周辺を訪れて泉小太郎の民話を聞くと、「相違点はあるにせよ、これはおそらく一つの話に違いない」と考えた。
1957年（昭和32年）発行の『信濃の民話』（未來社『日本の民話』シリーズ）には、長野県の各地（南安曇郡・北安曇郡・東筑摩郡・小県郡）に伝わる小泉小太郎および泉小太郎の民話を一つの物語にまとめた「小泉小太郎」が収録されている。前半部分は概ね先に示した小泉小太郎のあらすじに沿った内容であるが、小太郎の母は山の向こうの湖の中で生きており、後半で成長した小太郎が母をたずねて旅立ち、再会した二人が力を合わせて湖を切り開くという内容である。同様の物語は1973年（昭和48年）発行の『民衆の英雄』（角川書店『日本の民話』シリーズ）にも「小泉小太郎と母竜」（瀬川拓男による再話）の題で収録されているが、本作では小太郎の父親が開拓者集団の長（おさ）という設定であり、松本盆地のみならず、同じく湖であった上田盆地についても、三頭山から虚空蔵山を結ぶ半過の崖を小太郎と母竜が突き崩し、排水したとするなど、『小県郡史 余篇』や『信濃の民話』のものとは異なる点もある。この「小太郎と母龍」の物語はテレビアニメ『まんが日本昔ばなし』で放送され、同作のDVD第5巻に収録されている。演出は樋口雅一、文芸は沖島勲、美術は小関俊一、作画は高橋信也が担当した。
『信濃の民話』の編集委員の一人であった松谷みよ子は、「水との闘いの民話」の多くが陰惨な内容であるなか、小泉小太郎を明るく雄大な物語として捉えた。忘れられつつあった小泉小太郎を復活させ、秋田県の民話や自身の体験、また子供たちとの関わりなどをもとに、松谷が1959年（昭和34年）度に創作したのが『龍の子太郎』である。

概要
諏訪の龍蛇信仰
国史では諏訪大社に祀られている神は「建御名方神」と「八坂刀売神」という名前で登場しており、『古事記』や『先代旧事本紀』ではこの建御名方神が建御雷神との力比べに敗れてしまう大国主神の次男として描かれている。諏訪では諏訪の神（建御名方神）を蛇（あるいは龍）とする伝承や民話は多く残っており、建御名方神を祀る諏訪大社上社の神事（中世まで行われた御室神事など）には龍蛇信仰の痕跡が見受けられる。

伝説の成立
鎌倉時代には諏訪上社の大祝を務めた諏訪氏（神氏）が武士化して北条得宗家の御内人となり、諏訪大社が鎌倉幕府の庇護を受けるにつれて諏訪信仰が全国に広まり、軍神として多くの武士から信仰を集めた。諏訪氏の始祖が8歳の時に諏訪明神（建御名方神）に自分の生ける神体として選ばれたという伝承から、大祝代々は現人神、すなわち諏訪明神の後裔で明神そのものとして崇敬された。諏訪氏がこれを利用して権力を振るい、諏訪神党と称される武士団を形成していく。しかし、幕府滅亡後に起こった中先代の乱で諏訪氏の権威は失墜し、カリスマ性を失った大祝から氏人は離れた。この時代には大祝家直伝の縁起譚ではなくもっと在地の風景に根付いた縁起が求められた影響で、各地に諏訪氏や大祝とは絡みのない新たな「諏訪縁起」が同時多発的に発生した。諏訪の神を武士として描く甲賀三郎伝説はその中の一つである。
当時は『古事記』や六国史は安易に講読できない史料であったため、中世前期の諏訪縁起は記紀神話の影響なしに新たに編纂されたものである。実際には『先代旧事本紀』に書かれている建御名方神の説話を諏訪大社の正式な縁起として採用する文献は『諏方大明神画詞』（1356年）が初めてである。

あらすじ
甲賀三郎伝説には主人公の名前を「諏方（よりかた）」とするものと「兼家（かねいえ）」と伝えるものがあり、それぞれ内容が異なる。

諏訪縁起（諏方系）
神道集「諏訪縁起の事」では、甲賀三郎伝説は以下のように語られている。
近江国甲賀郡に住む安寧天皇から5代の孫の甲賀権守諏胤（よりたね）という地頭が惣追捕使として東国の33ヶ国を治めた。大和国添上郡の地頭・春日権守の長女を娶り3人の子（太郎諏致・次郎諏任・三郎諏方）をもうけた。
70歳余になった諏胤は病床に三男の三郎諏方（よりかた）を惣領として東海道15ヶ国の惣追捕使の職を与え、長男の太郎諏致（よりむね）に東山8ヶ国、次男の次郎諏任（よりただ）に北陸道7ヶ国の惣追捕使に任命する。諏胤は亡くなり、35日の塔婆供養の3日後に奥方も亡くなる。

三郎が父の三回忌の後に三笠山明神に参詣したとき、春日権守の孫娘・春日姫と契りを結び、ともに甲賀郡へ帰った。ある日春日姫は伊吹山で天狗にさらわれて行方不明になったため、三郎は兄たちとともに全国の山々を巡る。最後に信濃国にある蓼科山の人穴の底に姫を見つけ、助け出した。しかし姫が忘れた鏡を取りに三郎が穴に戻ると、次郎が裏切って綱を切ったため、穴に取り残された。三郎は仕方なく人穴を彷徨い、地底の72ヶ国を通り、最後に維縵（ゆいまん）国に辿り着く。三郎は維縵国の王・好美翁の末娘である維縵姫と結ばれて、国の風習に従って毎日鹿狩りをして過ごす。一方、次郎は春日姫を自分の妻にして三郎に代わって政治を行い、甲賀の舘を占拠した。春日姫は次郎に従おうとしなかったため、次郎は逆上し家来に春日姫を切らせることにしたが、春日姫は乳母の妹婿に助けられて祖父のもとへ送り届けられる。

13年6ヶ月後、春日姫の事を思い出した三郎は地上に帰ることを決意する。これを受け入れた維縵姫は彼の後を追って忍び妻（隠し妻）となると言った。国王から頂いた鹿の生肝で作った餅を1日1枚ずつ千枚を食べながら地上に向かい、信濃国の浅間山に無事帰ることができた。三郎は甲賀に戻ったが、体が蛇になっていたことを知り、父の為に造った笹岡の釈迦堂の仏壇の下に身を隠した。すると甲賀三郎の物語を語る僧たち（正体は白山権現、富士浅間大菩薩、熊野権現などの神々）の口から蛇身を逃れる方法を聞く。僧たちに言われる通りにした三郎は人間の姿に戻り、春日姫と再会した。2人は震旦国の南にある平城国に行って「早那起梨の天子」より神道の法を授かって神通力を会得した後、日本に戻って蓼科山に到着する。岡屋の里に立った三郎は諏訪大明神の上宮（諏訪大社上社）、春日姫は下宮（諏訪大社下社）として出現した。（「諏訪（すわ）」という名称は三郎の実名である「諏方」から来ているという。）維縵姫も後に地上にやって来て、春日姫に歓迎されて浅間大明神となる。甲賀三郎と兄たちは近江国の鎮守・兵主大明神が仲裁し、太郎が下野国宇都宮の示現大明神、悔悟した二郎が若狭国の田中明神、父が赤山大明神、母が日光権現として顕れ物語は終了する。

生還する甲賀三郎
伝説の変化形の一例は以下である。
醍醐天皇の時代、信濃国望月に住む源頼重に、武勇に優れた三人の息子がいた。朝廷の命で若狭国の高懸山の賊退治に駆り出され、三男の三郎がことのほか活躍した。功が弟一人に行くことを妬んだ兄たちは三郎を深い穴に突き落として、帰国してしまった。三郎は気絶したが、息を吹き返し、なんとか生還した。驚いた兄たちは逃げ出し、三郎は兄たちの領地を引き継いで治めた。その後、承平の乱で軍功を上げたことで江州の半分を賜り、甲賀郡に移って甲賀近江守となった。

作品化
正保3年（1646年）には、近江国の甲賀三郎兼家を主人公とした古浄瑠璃『すわのほんぢ兼家』が書かれた。
宝永元年（1704年）には、近松門左衛門の作とされる浄瑠璃『甲賀三郎』が書かれた。こちらは近江国の甲賀左衛門兼連の子、三郎兼家が鬼退治をする話。
伝説に大蛇や不義密通など、多くの挿話が付け加えられ、享保20年（1735年）に初代竹田出雲によって『甲賀三郎窟物語（いわやものがたり）』という人形浄瑠璃になり、物語として世間に広まった。
甲賀三郎を主人公とした『嫐（うわなり）』という歌舞伎もある。

概要
人口346人、世帯数163世帯。面積3.17平方キロメートル。周囲7.9キロメートル、最高点107メートルの円形台地状をしており、その周辺をラグーンと外洋が取り巻く。村内・上原・下原の三集落があり、一人の区長が統括している。
1979年度（昭和54年度）から本島との架橋の早期実現を望む要請活動が展開され、2005年（平成17年）2月8日に古宇利島大橋が開通した。
生活用水については、1975年度から1976年度にかけて本島（今帰仁村運天）からの海底送水管が整備された。農業用水については、古宇利大橋に併設する送水管で名護市の屋我地島から送水を受けている（経年劣化による破裂のおそれがあり2022年5月20日から送水停止となっている）。

歴史
琉球政府時代の1960年代より、島内の生活・産業基盤の整備が進められ、1970年代には海底からの送電・送水による電力供給施設・簡易水道・灌漑用貯水池が、1980年代には公民館と島を一周する道路が、1990年代には漁港・水産加工施設が、2000年代には公民館の建て替えと海岸道路、古宇利大橋の建設が行われた。

産業
古くから半農半漁であり、サトウキビや紅芋などの商品作物の栽培と、ウニ漁・モズク養殖などの沿岸・沖合漁業が行われているが、農業は従事者の高齢化と収益性の問題、漁業もウニの減少やモズクの不作・魚価の低迷を受けて厳しい経営環境におかれている。
古宇利大橋開通後、加工業や小売業への新規参入がある反面、既存のものは低迷・消滅している。

教育
今帰仁村立古宇利小学校 - 2013年3月末日で閉校。
2003年度までは小中併置校であったが、村内中学校の統合により2004年度から2012年度まで小学校のみ存在した。閉校に伴いこの島の小中学生は沖縄本島にある今帰仁村立天底小学校、今帰仁村立今帰仁中学校まで通学することになった。

交通
道路
2005年2月に古宇利大橋が完成し、名護市の屋我地島と橋で結ばれた。行政上は今帰仁村に帰属しているが、屋我地島と今帰仁村本島側との間の架橋（ワルミ大橋）が開通するまでは、古宇利島から村役場のある仲宗根に向かう際、またこの島の中学生らが通学する際にも屋我地大橋を経由して迂回しなければならなかった。

沖縄県道247号古宇利屋我地線（古宇利大橋）
沖縄バス・那覇バスが運行する定期観光バスには古宇利島を組み込んでいるコースがある。
やんばる急行バスが今帰仁村の本島側と古宇利島を結ぶ、那覇 - 今帰仁間バス利用客限定の無料バスを運行していたが、2020年7月1日より運賃を支払えば誰でも利用可能な一般路線バスとなり、古宇利島に乗り入れる初の路線バスとなった。

船舶
1911年にサバニによる本島への定期輸送が開始され、2005年の古宇利大橋完成まで運行していた。

小手姫伝説
小手子には、現在の福島県川俣町に落ち延びて養蚕を伝えたという「小手姫（おてひめ）伝説」がある。
小手子の子、蜂子皇子は厩戸皇子（聖徳太子）の計らいで京を逃れ、山形県鶴岡市の出羽三山の開祖となったと伝えられるが、小手子も、蜂子皇子を捜し求めて、実父と娘・錦代皇女とともに東北に落ち延びた。旅の途中に錦代皇女を亡くした小手子は、故郷の大和の風情に似た、現在の福島県伊達郡川俣町や伊達市月舘地域にとどまり、桑を植え養蚕の技術を人々に広めたという。その後小手子は、蜂子皇子に会えないことを悲嘆して、川俣町大清水地内にある清水に身を投げたと伝えられている。
川俣町付近には小手姫にちなむ史跡等が残り、川俣町は「絹の里」とし、ゆるきゃら小手姫様などでPRをしている。

概要
承久の乱で朝廷は鎌倉幕府に敗れた。乱後その朝廷側首謀者であった後鳥羽上皇は隠岐へ配流となった。その京都から隠岐への配流ルートは正史においては以下の通り。

『吾妻鏡』  : 承久3年（1221年）7月13日幕府武士に囲まれて鳥羽の行宮を出発、7月27日出雲大湊へ着、そこから隠岐へ向かい、8月5日隠岐国阿摩郡苅田郷に着
『承久兵乱記』 : 京都から播磨明石浦へ出て、美作と伯耆の境を越えて出雲大湊へ着、そこから隠岐へ向う
ただ備後から雲南の一部にかけては以下の配流伝説が残る。

長井浦（糸崎港）→吉舎→総領→庄原→比和→高野にて行宮を設い年越し→飯南→松江大湊（美保関）
また船ではなく、播磨から山陰道を進んでいた上皇が西国を見たいと南下して山陽道を進み、承久3年7月末に備後に入ったとする話もある。更に、上皇が隠岐から脱出し中国山地を超えたあたりで崩御したとする伝説も残る。様々な伝説が動線のように点在し、一部は地名の由来となっている。伝説は備後側、特に庄原市高野町に多く残る反面、出雲側にはほとんどない。
なおこの伝説を元に内田康夫が創作したのが、浅見光彦シリーズ第1作『後鳥羽伝説殺人事件』である。

伝説
番号は上皇が通ったとされる南から北の順番、表記は右地図に合わせ北から列挙する。

17. 沖ノ郷山（飯南町） : 上皇が訪れ隠岐を望んだ「隠岐の望（おきのぼう）」が名の由来の一つ。周辺には「隠岐原」「国王原」「殿居」などの地名が残る
16. 王貫峠 : 上皇がここを超えて出雲に入ったことが名の由来。
15. 黒木神社（高野町） : 「天皇社」とも。高野に滞在中、冬季のみ用いた黒木御所の跡と伝わる。上皇の試作とされた観音像があったが火災により焼失している。
14. 中山神社（高野町） : 黒木御所滞在中に創建したと伝わる。
13. 功徳寺（高野町） : 高野町における後鳥羽伝説の中心地とされる。『芸藩通志』に「ここも皇居にてありしといふ。堂の作り他にたがひて殊勝なり」とあり、承久3年（1221年）9月から翌承久4年（1222年）3月まで滞在したと伝わる。「萬歳院」の院号と勅額・硯・御衣などを下賜されたと伝わり、現在では寺宝として残る。
12. 蔀山 : 功徳寺滞在中の上皇が山の紅葉を賞した歌が残る。「蔀山降ろす嵐のはげしくて 紅葉の錦きぬ人もなし」。
11. 御所地山 : 一時滞在した地と伝わる。
10. 王居峠 : 御所地山麓の峠。
9. 王居峠神社 : ここに駕を止めたと伝わる。その伝説からスサノオを勧請して祀ったのが神社としての起源になる。
8. 大内山神社（濁川町） : 上皇が勧請したと伝わる。
7. 三良坂町仁賀 : 元々は二荷村といったが上皇が通ったことで仁賀村と称するようになった。上皇が休憩した所を意味する「仮屋迫」が小字の名として残り、そこから山の尾根沿いの道を「皇宇根」と言った（『国郡志御用に付仁賀村書上帳』）。
6. 皇渡橋 : 上皇が渡河した（『国郡志御用に付仁賀村書上帳』）地点にかかる橋。『三良坂町誌』にはなかなか渡れなかった上皇が残した歌が記載されている。「われこそはわたりゆくべき川水も 心あらばやかわきだにせよ」。
5. 登美志山 : 上皇は山を見て「皆人のふじと知られて傭後なる 富士の山の峰の白雪」と歌を残した（『国郡志御用に付安田村書上帳』）。
4. 吉舎町 : 上皇が宿泊した際に「吉き舎り（よきやどり）」と言われたことが名の由来 （『国郡志御用に付吉舎村書上帳』）。
3. 艮神社（吉舎町） : ここで宿泊したと伝わる。上皇真筆とされる勅額が存在していたが、調査のため広島県庁に提出したところ明治9年（1876年）庁舎の出火により消失してしまった。
2. 世羅町田打 : 「行在」という地名が残り、上皇の宿泊地と伝わる。
1. 長井の浦（糸崎港） : 万葉集にも出てくる古代からある港で、糸碕神社付近が長井浦とされるが、一説には尾道にあるとも。宝暦10年（1760年）『長井浦記』に上皇が隠岐で詠んだ歌として「隠岐の国たく火の里にたかぬ火を 備後の本梨にいまぞたくろう」が書かれている。当時その付近は木梨村といい、たくろうとは不知火のその地方での呼び名であることから、尾道から三原にかけてのあたりで上皇が上陸したことを暗示しているという。
三次市作木町には2つの伝説、つまり上皇が隠岐へ配流途中で崩御した伝説（『大山国郡志』）、あるいは隠岐を脱出してこの地まで辿り着いて崩御した伝説（『浄円寺文書』）が残る。

4. 高宮町佐々部 : 「式敷」という地名があり、これは上皇が用いた敷物に由来する。
3. 蓮照寺（高宮町） : 寺宝として後鳥羽上皇坐像と、後鳥羽院尊儀と記された位牌が残る。
2. 後鳥羽院尊儀
1. 後鳥羽院御陵
同じ町の別の場所に2つ御陵（墓碑）が建つ。
御陵の周辺には「ゆかん岩」（御遺体を清めるのに使った）「はいばら」（参拝地点）「番僧」（番所地点）「多宝茶」（京都から持ち込まれて野生化したと伝えられる）など上皇にまつわる地名が残っている。

概要
平安時代中期、坂上田村麻呂と藤原利仁は史実をかけ離れて説話や軍記物語、寺社の縁起などに頻繁に登場すると同時に、その人物像も次第に史実から解離して伝説化が進んだことで田村語りが萌芽して成長し始めた。
京都での最も早い伝説化は、元亨2年（1322年）に臨済宗の僧・虎関師錬がまとめた『元亨釈書』巻9「清水寺延鎮伝」に「奥州の逆賊高丸が駿河国の清見関を目指して攻め上がり、坂将軍田村の出陣を聞いた高丸は奥州へと退いた」と、清水寺の創建縁起から続けた物語が加えられ、『群書類従』所収の藤原明衡撰の『清水寺縁起』では登場していなかった高丸が登場したことで脚色が加えられ、史実から遊離して説話化が進んだ。
東北地方における田村麻呂の事蹟や田村語りは、鎌倉時代末期の正安2年（1300年）頃成立、編纂者は幕府中枢の複数の者と見られている『吾妻鏡』に武具の奉納の言い伝えや達谷窟における賊の討伐と寺院の建立が残されている。文治5年（1189年）9月21日の条では、源頼朝が胆沢郡鎮守府に鎮座する鎮守府八幡宮に参詣した事が記されている。田村麻呂が東夷の為に下向した時に勧進され、田村麻呂の弓箭や鞭などが宝蔵に納められていると創建の由来を記している。これは平安京に岩清水八幡宮が勧進される以前に、田村麻呂により鎌倉方が崇敬する八幡神が胆沢郡の鎮守府に勧進されていた事に驚いて記述した。同年9月28日の条では、頼朝が鎌倉へと帰還する途中、平泉達谷窟を通ったときの記述に「田村麻呂利仁等の将軍、綸命を奏じて夷を征するの時、賊主悪路王並びに赤頭等、塞を構ふるの岩屋なり」とあり、岩屋から外ヶ浜まで10日あまりで至り、坂上将軍は鞍馬寺を模して多聞天を安置、西光寺と号して水田を寄付したと続けている。『吾妻鏡』で田村麻呂利仁と続けて書かれていることが、のちの田村麻呂と利仁の融合へと影響した。

文芸作品
生前から毘沙門天の化身と評価されていたことから、田村麻呂の事績や伝説は早くから文芸作品となって、室町時代初期の京都では勢州鈴鹿の悪魔を討つ能『田村』や、中期から後期にかけて鈴鹿御前と夫婦となり近江国の高丸や鈴鹿山の大だけ丸を討つお伽草子『鈴鹿の草子（田村の草子）』が語られ、江戸時代の東北地方では『田村の草子』を底本にした奥浄瑠璃『田村三代記』が作られ、人々に伝えられた。
全国各地の寺社や霊地の縁起に取り入れられたのは、これら田村語りのスケールの壮大さが可能にした。

主人公
歴史上の人物である坂上田村麻呂がモデルとされ、物語や伝説によっては出羽や北東北で活躍した鎮守府将軍・藤原利仁と融合されていることもある。
『鈴鹿の草子（田村の草子）』では坂上田村丸俊宗 / 坂上田村麻呂俊宗、『田村三代記』では坂上田村丸利仁 / 坂上田村麻呂利仁とされる。通称は田村丸、田村丸利仁、田村丸将軍など。

学説
1910年代に日本と北米において「坂上田村麻呂夷人説」（夷人＝蝦夷）・「坂上田村麻呂黒人説」が唱えられた。これらの説も見方によっては新たな坂上田村麻呂伝説の創成と言える。

史実性の議論
岩手県、宮城県、福島県を中心に多数分布する。大方は、田村麻呂が観音など特定の神仏の加護で蝦夷征討や鬼退治を果たし、感謝してその寺社を建立したというものである。伝承は田村麻呂が行ったと思われない地（青森県など）にも分布するが、京都市の清水寺を除いて、ほとんどすべてが後世の付託と考えられる。その他、田村麻呂が見つけた温泉、田村麻呂が休んだ石など様々に付会した物や地が多い。
坂上田村麻呂伝説について高橋崇は、討征譚や縁起譚の他に口誦伝説も多く、征討のさいに腰をかけて休んだ石や、矢をかけた矢掛松、奥州誕生説を説いて産湯に使用した泉など「だれの場合にもつきものの採るに足らぬ俗説も多い」とし、伝説がどのようにして作られ、いかなる方法で流布したかなども考慮しなくてはいけないとしている。また後世の東北地方で田村麻呂を称え、思募していることについて、田村麻呂本人にとってはあずかり知らないことであるが、後世の人々が伝説を受け入れたのは確かであるとしている。

東北地方では『田村三代記』が間接的に地元の伝説や寺社縁起譚として取り入れられた場合があり、一般的に地元の鬼神退治譚もしくは鬼神退治の後日譚（残党の退治譚）といった内容となる。
東北地方の他に伝説や縁起譚を持つ寺社は関東地方、中部地方、近畿地方、中国地方にまで及ぶ。各地の縁起は田村語りを基本にしつつ、その地方の歴史的、地理的な役割が反映されている。

東北地方
青森県
青森ねぶたは昭和末期までは田村麻呂の蝦夷征伐が起源と言われていた。もちろん史実の上では現在の盛岡市までしか北上していないことになっているが、青森市内には蝦夷征伐が行われたこと伝える史跡が複数残っており、いずれかの人物が来た可能性は高い。文室綿麻呂は811年に蝦夷大征伐を行っておりその大半が田村麻呂没後である。この前年、薬子の変にあたり誤認逮捕されていた綿麻呂が田村麻呂によって解放されたことから、綿麻呂自身がみずからの戦功を田村麻呂に捧げたとも考えることができる。

岩手県
気仙郡の猪川観音（長谷寺）、小友観音（常膳寺）、矢作観音（観音寺）の気仙三観音の勧進由来では、大嶽丸の残党と目される三鬼の残党の退治譚が記される。
一関市と南町、千代田町、台町及び真柴の一部の地域は鬼死骸と呼ばれている。

宮城県
白石市斎川の古将堂の勧進由来では、田村将軍が東征の際に、悪路王や赤頭という荒土や丹砂を塗って化けた妖魁を鈴鹿御前の援助で討伐したので、この地に2人を祭祀したとある。
色麻町の磯良神社では、田村将軍が東征の際に東右衛門という水練の達者な武士が従軍し、激流の川を恐れず先導役を務めた報償として「川童」の姓と土地を与えた。
大崎市（旧鳴子町）の鬼首温泉は田村将軍に首を撥ねられた蝦夷の大将である大竹丸（おおたけまる）に由来する。

秋田県
秋田県三種町と能代市にまたがる房住山では、鬼面と呼ばれる阿計徒丸、阿計留丸、阿計志丸の長面三兄弟が住み、眷属を指揮して良民を苦しめるも、坂上田村麻呂将軍に倒された。将軍が房住山で鬼の慰霊法要をしていると、東の山上から日高山（房住山の南約7.5kmにある、現在地形図で赤倉山とされる五城目町の山。）の麓の洞穴に逃れ生き延びた阿計徒丸が目を覚まして「身の丈1丈3尺5寸ある大長丸（おおたけまる）と申す」と叫んだ。

山形県
山形県では『奥羽観蹟聞老志』「長谷堂城の項目」や、長井市の總宮神社などに田村麻呂による建立としている寺社は確認出来るものの、田村語りに関連した伝承は皆無に等しい。阿部幹男は、阿玉桜（伊佐沢の久保ザクラ）は、かつて山形県でも田村語りが語られていた痕跡ではないかとしている。

福島県
郡山市田村町の田村神社では『鎮守山縁起』に取り込まれている。田村郡では大滝根山が、白河市付近では国見山が鬼神や大武丸の住みかとして設定された。

関東地方
関東地方では、茨城県鹿嶋市鹿島神宮、那珂市上宮寺、城里町桂地区下野達谷窟、栃木県矢板市木幡神社、将軍塚、那須烏山市の星宮神社、大田原市那須神社、群馬県三国峠田村神社、埼玉県東松山市正方寺などが挙げられる。

埼玉県
東松山市では、大同元年に田村将軍が正法寺の岩殿観音に祈願して毒竜を退治し、弁天沼に首を埋めたという話が残る。
同様の話は児玉郡美里町でも田村麻呂による大蛇退治として語られ、その際に美里町小茂田・沼上・十条・阿那志・古郡の５か所に、赤城大明神の神霊を、赤城山に向かって（北向きに）祀った、北向大明神とか北向神社と称される神社を建立。

中部地方
中部地方では、山梨県富士吉田市冨士山下宮小室浅間神社、長野県安曇野有明山、長野市松代町西条清水寺、若穂保科清水寺、諏訪市諏訪大社、静岡県浜松市岩水寺や有玉神社が挙げられる。

長野県
長野県の安曇野をはじめ松本盆地一帯には田村麻呂が魏石鬼八面大王を妻の紅葉鬼神ともども征伐したという伝説が広く残されている。これは『信府統記』「第十七」の記述に基づく伝承であるが、『仁科濫觴記』に見える田村守宮を大将とする仁科の軍による八面鬼士大王を首領とする盗賊団の征伐を元に産まれた伝説であると考えられている。

近畿地方
近畿地方では、三重県亀山市片山神社、滋賀県甲賀市田村神社などが挙げられる。
鈴鹿山脈は古来より交通の要所であり盗賊が横行したことから鬼や賊の伝承が残されている。田村麻呂が鈴鹿御前や鈴鹿山の鬼神・大嶽丸を討伐した話として『鈴鹿の草子（田村の草子）』、奥浄瑠璃『田村三代記』を通じて坂上田村麻呂伝説が広く知られている。鈴鹿峠を滋賀県側へ下ったところに坂上田村麻呂公を主祭神とする田村神社が鎮座する。

三重県
熊野の周辺では鬼ヶ城伝説を中心に泊観音（清水寺）、大馬神社などの縁起に坂上田村麻呂伝説が残されている。
熊野近くの南牟婁郡御浜町尾呂志でも、鬼ヶ城で鬼の首魁や手下を討伐した田村将軍が四鬼の窟に棲む鬼を征伐したという伝承が伝わっている。

滋賀県
甲賀市には、鈴鹿山の悪鬼を平定した田村麻呂が残っていた矢を放って「この矢の功徳で万民の災いを防ごう。矢の落ちたところに自分を祀れ」と言われ、矢の落ちたところに本殿を建てたとされている田村神社や、鈴鹿山の山賊討伐の報恩のために堂宇を建立して毘沙門天を祀ったという櫟野寺がある。東近江市には十一面観世音菩薩の石像を安置して鬼神討伐の祈願をした北向岩屋十一面観音、討伐した大嶽丸を手厚く埋葬したという首塚の残る善勝寺がある。

中国地方
中国地方では、岡山県倉敷市児島由加神社などが挙げられる。

岡山県
岡山県倉敷市児島由加にある由加山には、この山を根城とした阿久良王という妖鬼を退治にきた伝説が残る。通生の浦へ船でやってきた田村麻呂は神宮寺八幡院で7日7夜に渡って鬼退治の祈願をしたという。
岡山市南区および玉野市の金甲山は、田村麻呂が由加山の鬼退治に向かう際に、戦勝を祈願して神の峰に金の甲を山頂付近に埋めたという伝承が名前の由来とされる。ふもとの円通寺の竜王様に戦勝御礼として金の甲を奉納したという。

縁起譚
坂上田村麻呂の建立とされる寺社や奉納したとされる寺社伝説はゆかりの深い東北の岩手県、宮城県、福島県を中心に残されている。また彼が通過したと考えられる茨城県、長野県、山梨県、静岡県、愛知県、三重県、滋賀県にも残されている。しかし、田村麻呂が直接行ったとは考えられない山形県、秋田県、青森県さらに西日本の和歌山県や岡山県にも伝説が残る。特に多くの伝説が残されているのは福島県田村地方であり、生誕伝説から地名伝説そして寺社伝説に至るまで約80種類（うち30種類は寺社伝説）を数える。次に多いのが宮城県で約40種類（うち25種類は寺社伝説）の伝説が残されている。

寺社建立伝説
坂上田村麻呂が建立したという由緒をもつ寺社は宮城県の観音寺を中心に全国に100以上を数える。

平泉雑記
江戸時代の安永年間（1772年 - 1781年）に相原友直が仙台藩の風土を記した『平泉雑記』に「田村将軍建立堂社」の1節が設けられ、『封内名跡志』を参考に若干の例を加えた次の21例を挙げている。

鎮守府八幡宮、達谷窟毘沙門堂は『東鏡』に詳細であるとする。21例のうち神社が6例、寺院が観音を本尊とする13例と最も多く、東北全体ではさらに多くなると予想している。『平泉雑記』では、田村麻呂建立の観音は「大同2年」が多く、悉く信用が不足していると述べている。

記念物
田村麻呂は蝦夷や賊の征討に際して各地の寺社を参拝し武具を奉納したと言われている。その内、以下の寺社は現存している奉納物が田村麻呂に由来していると伝えられている。

地理・成因
南方以外を丘陵の原生林に囲まれており、およそ2万年前に風や波により運ばれてきた砂が溜まりせき止められて出来上がったと考えられている。
面積はおよそ2万平方メートル。深さは具体的な数値は定かではなく、後述する竜神伝説から底無しと言われている。

竜神伝説
平安末期の1169年6月13日、比叡山の皇円阿闍利が、56億7000万年後に現れるという弥勒菩薩に教えを乞うと言い残し、自ら桜ヶ池の底に沈んで竜神（大蛇）となった。
以降、秋の彼岸の中日には赤飯を詰めたお櫃を池に沈めて竜神に供える奇祭「お櫃納め」が行われている。数日後には空になったお櫃が浮いてくると言われ、遠州七不思議のひとつになっている。
桜ヶ池に沈めたお櫃が、同じく竜神伝説の残る長野県の諏訪湖に浮いたことがあるとされ、諏訪湖と地底でつながっているという言い伝えがある。これに関連して、静岡県浜松市の池の平では7年周期で池（幻の池）が湧くという不可思議な現象が起こるが、これは桜ヶ池の竜神が諏訪湖に赴く際に休息するためであるという言い伝えがある。

外八海
富士講では、「八海めぐり」といって、8か所の湖沼で水行（垢離）を行う修行が重んじられている。桜ヶ池は「佐倉湖」として、「外八海」の1つとなっている。

伝説
岩手県上閉伊郡松崎村（現：遠野市）の寒戸にいた娘がある日、木の下に草履を残して消息を絶った。
その30年後、親戚たちが集まっているところへ、その娘がすっかり老いさらばえた姿で帰ってきた。事情を尋ねる親戚たちに対し、娘はみんなに逢いたくて帰って来たものの、山に帰らなければならないと言って去って行った。その日は風が強かったので、遠野ではそれ以来、強風の日は「寒戸の婆が帰ってきそうな日だ」といわれたという。

解説
この話は『遠野物語』のほかの話と同様、民話収集家の佐々木喜善の集めた話を柳田國男が編纂したものだが、遠野には寒戸という地名は存在しない。佐々木は自著書『東奥異聞』に、これと同様の話を以下のように記述している。

「登戸（のぼと）」という地名は松崎村に実在することから、こちらの佐々木の話が原話であり、「寒戸」は「登戸」の誤記、または柳田の聞き間違いとの指摘があるが、「のぼと」と「さむと」の聞き間違いや、「寒」を「登」と誤植する可能性は低く、さらに佐々木の話では老婆がその後も何度も村を訪れたなどの差異が認められることから、柳田が意図的に話を改変したものと見る向きもある。また、登戸のある旧家では、明治初期に茂助という当主の娘が消息を絶ち、数十年後に山姥のような姿に成り果てて村に現れたと伝えられており、これが伝説のモデルともいわれる。
この伝説は現地では「モンスケ婆」などと呼ばれて恐れられ、強風の日にはモンスケ婆が村に姿を現すといわれたり、上閉伊郡土淵村（現・遠野市）では泣き喚く子供を「モンスケ婆様来るぞ」と言って叱りつけたりもしていた。しかし『遠野物語』が有名になり、『遠野物語』の多くの語り手が「寒戸の婆」を語ることで、「登戸の婆」が「寒戸の婆」の名で、遠野の伝承として定着する結果となっている。
なお伝承を示す史跡は現地には特になく、遠野市松崎町の登戸橋付近に伝説内容を記した案内碑が建てられているのみである。

地図上では佐夜の中山と表記されるが、夜泣き石の伝説においては小夜の中山と表記されることが多い。このページでは小夜の中山とする。

夜泣き石の伝説
小夜の中山峠は、旧東海道の金谷宿と日坂宿の間にあり、急峻な坂のつづく難所である。曲亭馬琴の『石言遺響』（文化2年）（1805年）によれば、その昔、お石という身重の女が小夜の中山に住んでいた。ある日お石がふもとの菊川の里（現・静岡県島田市菊川）で仕事をして帰る途中、中山の丸石の松の根元で陣痛に見舞われ苦しんでいた。そこを通りかかった轟業右衛門という男がしばらく介抱していたのだが、お石が金を持っていることを知ると斬り殺して金を奪い逃げ去った。
その時お石の傷口から子供が生まれた。そばにあった丸石にお石の霊が乗り移って夜毎に泣いたため、里の者はその石を『夜泣き石』と呼んでおそれた。生まれた子は夜泣き石のおかげで近くにある久延寺の和尚に発見され、音八と名付けられて飴で育てられた。音八は成長すると、大和の国の刀研師の弟子となり、すぐに評判の刀研師となった。
そんなある日、音八は客の持ってきた刀を見て「いい刀だが、刃こぼれしているのが実に残念だ」というと、客は「去る十数年前、小夜の中山の丸石の附近で妊婦を切り捨てた時に石にあたったのだ」と言ったため、音八はこの客が母の仇と知り、名乗りをあげて恨みをはらしたということである。
その後、この話を聞き同情した弘法大師（空海）が、石に仏号をきざんでいったという。
なお、ほぼ同様な伝説は安永2年（1773年）刊行の随筆「煙霞綺談」(遠州の人・西村白鳥 著)にも記載されている。

夜泣き石の場所
現在夜泣き石と伝えられている石は2つ存在し、以下の場所に安置されている。

国道1号小夜の中山トンネルの手前（東京側）の道路脇（北緯34度49分19秒 東経138度05分50秒 ）「夜泣き石」を東京で見せ物にする興行が失敗し、焼津に置き去りになっていたものを地元の人々が運んだとされる。
久延寺境内（北緯34度48分59秒 東経138度05分50秒）こちらは本来の夜泣き石ではない。
また、かつて置かれていた場所には、夜泣石跡の石碑がある（北緯34度48分19秒 東経138度05分02秒）。

子育て飴
久延寺の和尚が飴で子を育てたという伝説から、子育て飴という、琥珀色の水飴が小夜の中山の名物となっている。久延寺の隣にある茶屋「扇屋」が、峠を通る客に出したのが始まりとされる。「国道1号小夜の中山トンネルの手前」には「名物 子育飴 元祖 小泉屋」があり、この店の裏にある。

生活形態
定住することなく狩猟採集によって生活する。箕を生産することでも知られ、交易のために村々を訪れることもあった。職業の区別もあり「ポン」と呼ばれるサンカは川漁、副業的な位置として竹細工などをしていた。また「ミナオシ」「テンバ」と呼ばれるサンカは箕、かたわらささら、箒の製造、行商、修繕を主な収入源としていたとされる。
サンカは明治期には全国で約20万人、昭和に入っても終戦直後に約1万人ほどいたと推定されているが、実際にはサンカの人口が正確に調べられたことはなく、以上の数値は推計に過ぎない。
サンカの女性は売春で生活している場合が多く、サンカは売春婦という意味でも使われた。日本語を使用するが、一部の単語では独特なサンカ語を使用する。

呼称
「サンカ」を漢字で書き記す時には統一的な表記法は無く、当て字により「山窩」「山家」「三家」「散家」「傘下」「燦下」（住む家屋を持たず傘や空を屋根とする屋外に住む存在という意味）などと表記した。 また、地方により「ポン」「カメツリ」「ミナオシ（箕直）」「ミツクリ（箕作）」「テンバ（転場）」など呼ばれ方も違う（それぞれの呼称は「ホイト（陪堂）」「カンジン（勧進）」など特定の職業を指す言葉と併用されることも多い）。
サンカの実態調査を試みた立場による呼び名の違いもある。

役所による呼称
住居を定めない浮浪漂泊者、野非人の群れの1つに「サンカ」「山カ」「さんか」等と記述されていた。
警察による呼称
例外なく「山窩」とされている。里に定住する村人から物を盗む犯罪専科の単位集団として規定されていた。
研究者による呼称
警察型「山窩」と混同することなく明確に「サンカ｣としている。
農林省による呼称
国有林、公有林などの保全維持業務の一環として、盗伐を防ぐため調査し「サンカ」「山窩」と表記、呼称していた。
また「ミナオシ」「テンバ」と呼ばれるサンカは箕、かたわらささら、箒の製造、行商、修繕を主な収入源としていたとされる。
一説では「サンカ」は自分達の呼称を仲間と言う意味で「けんた」と称し、河原にテントを張って生活する一団を「せぶりけんた」、一定の宿所を持っている者を「どや付けんた」と言ったとする。

「サンカ」という語彙の歴史
「サンカ」という言葉が現れたのが、江戸時代末期（幕末）の文書が最初である。北海道の名付け親でもある探検家の松浦武四郎の著書にサンカに命を救われたとの記述がある。彼ら自身がサンカと名乗ったわけではないため「サンカ」はこれ以前に口語として存在したと推察される。この手記では単に「山に住む人」という意味で使われている。広島の庄屋文書(1855年)にも「サンカ」の語は登場し「山に住む犯罪者」の意で記述されている。
明治に入ると警察を中心とした多くの行政文書に「山窩」と記述され、ほとんど山賊と同義の言葉として使用される。民俗学者の柳田國男が警察の依頼を受けて「山窩」の現地調査を行ったのもこの時代である。行政文書に「山窩」が登場する頻度は次第に減り、第二次世界大戦中にはほぼ皆無となっている。
「サンカ」の語が一般に広く知られるようになったのは、戦後にサンカ小説によって流行作家の地位を確立した三角寛が発表した一連の作品群によるところが大きい。これらは実際に山中に住み「サンカ」と呼ばれた実在の「松浦一家」への取材に基づいている。しかし三角は商業小説家であり「サンカ小説」の内容は娯楽性を追求した完全に創作の人間ドラマである。三角の小説が流行したことで、その設定を元に『風の王国』を執筆した五木寛之など、更にファンタジー性が増した大衆小説が大流行した。三角の協力を仰いだ映画『瀬降り物語』（中島貞夫監督）も制作されている。サンカ文学の流行後にはサンカは被差別民であり、サンカへの偏見を是正しようという誤解に基づいた運動が見られるようになるが、そのころには山間や里部の不定住者はほぼ消滅していた。
1980年代のオカルトブームでは謎多きサンカは格好の題材となり、神代文字を使用する、超能力を使う、古代文明の生き残りであるなど荒唐無稽な本が多数出版され、様々な誤解や俗説を産むようになった。更に一部の懐疑主義者からは「サンカはオカルト好きの創作ではないか」と実在まで疑われる事態となった。
その後のサンカ研究では、単純な貧困層（山間や里部でさまざまな隙間産業的な生業に就いていた者）と、犯罪者あるいは犯罪者予備軍の隠れ家としての生活形態を持っていた者を切り離して考えようという見方が一般的になりつつある。しかし全国的にサンカの名称が使われ出したのは、もっぱら官憲の用語としてであったことを考え合わせると、これもまた間違いであり、学問的中立性を欠いているという批判もある。強い監視が必要であると過去に目されていた一定の集団は、単純な貧困層より早い段階（おそらく昭和初期）に社会構造の変化や官憲の圧力により山間部や里部からは姿を消したのであろうという考察もある。社会学的な側面で「サンカ」という言葉やそれを取り巻く状況を検証する動きが成果を上げており、議論に一定の方向性が生まれつつある。
江戸時代末期から大正期の用法から見て、本来は官憲用語としての色合いが強い。その初期から犯罪者予備軍、監視および指導の対象者を指す言葉として用いられたことが、三角寛の小説における山窩像の背景となっている。また、サンカを学問の対象として捉えた最初の存在と言ってもよい柳田國男やその同時代の研究者らも、その知識の多くを官憲の情報に頼っている。官憲の刑事政策によって幕末から発生した、流民の虞犯者に対して「川魚漁をし、竹細工もする、漂泊民」の呼称であるサンカが（「山窩」という当て字で）使われた。それがマス・メディアに載って流通し、一人歩きした果てに、日本の中で異なる習俗をもった異なる種族の如き意味を孕むに至ったという。官憲からの情報で「山窩らしき」者を調査した柳田は、鷹野弥三郎のサンカ=犯罪者論を鋭く批判し、彼等の窃盗は「財貨に対する観念の相違に基づく」ものであるとして一応擁護の立場に立っている。

漂泊と定住
明治
サンカと呼ばれた不特定の層は徐々に元の生活圏に近い集落や都市部などに吸収されたと考えられる。

昭和30年代
これを境に里周辺部の非定住者の姿は見られることが少なくなった。
全国民の戸籍が登録される体制が整ったため、江戸時代に人別から洩れた層も明治以降の戸籍には編入されるようになったと考えるのが合理的である。江戸時代において無籍者に定住できる土地はなく、明治以降は政府が定住を指導したと考えられる。国家の近代化に伴う戸籍整備は徴税や徴兵など必然性がある。
戸籍と定住を強要されていった結果、戦後に日本文化と同化し姿を消したという主張をする論者もいる。
近代の社会形態の変化に伴い、過去に里周辺部などに見られた貧困層の多くが、都市のなかでも人口の流動性が高く生活困窮者の多い地域に移住したのではないかという主張もある。明治以降、官憲にとって監視や注意が必要であったのは、その犯罪性から移動範囲が大きかった人びと全般であり、その際に用いられたのが「サンカ」という概念であったという主張もある。

研究
歴史学者はサンカの存在については認知していたようだが、長年の間研究対象にする者は現れなかった。これはサンカが日本の歴代の中央政権に対して政治、経済、軍事、文化、宗教などの面で全く関わりあいがなかったためである。また、サンカは人数が少なく、遺跡などの学会で価値のある資料が見つかる可能性も低い。このためサンカ研究は一部の民俗学者に限られ、2000年以降の文系の大学や研究者が増えた時代にようやく専門の学会が結成された。
サンカに関する最初の学術調査と呼べるのは、柳田國男の調査である。彼は、『人類学雑誌』に『「イタカ」及び「サンカ」』と題された文章を1911年（明治44年）から1912年（明治45年）にかけて寄稿している。大垣警察署長であった広瀬寿太郎の聞き書きとして、ブリウチ　セブリ　ジリョウジ（なお南方熊楠の書簡に寄れば、呪療師の意かという）アガリの実態を柳田の実体験をまじえて記述している。
サンカは、柳田や喜田貞吉による大正期のもっぱら推論によってなされた問題提起、三角と同じく新聞記者であった鷹野弥三郎の取材記事以後、昭和に入ってからの後藤興善の『又鬼と山窩』（1940年）がみられる程度で、研究対象としてはほとんど顧みられていない。柳田も仮説の段階で研究を放棄しているが有名な柳田が研究していた事自体を誇大宣伝し自説の根拠とする人間もいる。
サンカに関する一般人の知識は、三角寛の創作によるところが大きい。三角は、新聞記者という経歴から実録小説のような体裁のスキャンダラスな山窩小説を執筆して一世を風靡した。終戦後、三角は戦前から1950年代にかけて全国で収集したというサンカに関する資料を基に、論文「サンカ社会の研究」を執筆。1962年には、東洋大学から文学博士の学位を取得している。1965年には、この論文を基にした著作『サンカの社会』（1965年）が刊行され、三角は一躍サンカ研究家として脚光を浴びることとなった。しかし、この研究は掲載されている写真の信憑性（別々の場所で違う日時に撮影されたはずであるにもかかわらず、同じ人物が同じ服装で写っている。後に筒井功によって写真のモデルが特定された）、さらに江戸時代末期の偽書『上記』を元にしたと考えられる「サンカ文字」が紹介されるなど、そのほとんどが三角による完全な創作と言うべきものだったことが、現在では確定している。

サンカの発生にまつわる諸説
古代難民説
サンカ（山人）は、原日本人（あるいは縄文人）であり、ヤマト政権により山間部に追いやられた異民族であるとする説。これは柳田國男の山人論に基くが、柳田はサンカと山人を区別して記述している。現代では分子人類学による科学的な遺伝子解析が進展したこともあり、そのような説には否定的な見解が多い。
中世難民説
動乱の続いた室町時代（南北朝、戦国時代）の遊芸民、職能集団を源とする仮説。起源を比較的古くまで求めることが可能な言葉である「三家」、「三界」、「坂の者」などを根拠とする。喜田貞吉の研究が代表的である。語源を探る上で説得力を持つが、江戸時代末期の中国地方の文書にあらわれた「サンカ」との因果を検証することが困難である。
近世難民説
江戸時代末期の飢饉から明治維新の混乱までの間に、山間部に避難した人びとが多数を占めるであろうという考察。サンカに関する記述が、近世末になって、天保の大飢饉が最も苛酷であった中国地方で登場することから、沖浦和光が主張している。

物語の要約
八郎太郎と十和田湖誕生
鹿角郡の草木（くさぎ）村（現・秋田県鹿角市十和田草木地区）に八郎太郎（はちろうたろう）という名の若者が暮らしていた。
八郎太郎はマタギをして生活していた。しかしある日仲間の掟を破り、仲間の分のイワナまで自分一人で食べてしまったところ、急に喉が渇き始め、33夜も川の水を飲み続け、いつしか33尺の竜へと変化していった。自分の身に起こった報いを知った八郎太郎は、十和田山頂に湖を作り、そこの主として住むようになった。この湖が十和田湖である。

南祖坊の誕生と修行
陸前気仙の近くにざん訴によって都落ちした藤原是真の子がいた。子供夫婦には子がいなかった。奥方は観音堂に祈願を込めたところ、満願の日に「願いをかなえてしんぜよう。だが、その子は弥勒の出世を願うことだ」とお告げがあった。やがて生まれた子が南祖坊であった。南祖坊は修行を重ね76歳の時熊野山において法力を得た。ある日「片方の草履と杖を与える。これを持って思いのまま歩け。片方の草履を見つけたらそこを永住の地とせよ」と神の声を聞くと共に、片方の鉄の草履と鉄杖を手にした。南祖坊は喜び、多くの地を踏破し、十和田湖の自籠岩付近でついに片方の草履を発見した。南祖坊はこの自籠岩に端座し、昼夜を分かたず経文を唱えた。そこに、湖の主である八郎太郎が現れた。

八郎太郎と南祖坊の戦い（その1）
南祖坊は八郎太郎に戦いを挑み、彼らは7日7晩戦った。南祖坊が法華の八巻を投げつけると、経の八万四千の文字が一本一本の剣になって八郎太郎に突き刺さる。こうして、八郎太郎は逃げ去った。静まりかえった湖面上に天の童子が現れ空中に浮かびながら「お前の難行苦行の結果、願いは達せられた。今こそ、その沼に入って弥勒の出世を得べし」と言うと、松の木の上に「十和田山正一位青龍権現」の文字がありありと映し出された。童子は「我こそは熊野山の使いなり」と言い、かき消すように失せた。南祖坊は大願成就と伏し拝んで湖にとび入り、潟の主になった。南祖坊が湖に入った場所がサング打場（占場）で、八郎太郎の血で染まった岩を赤根崎という。南祖坊は十和田青龍権現として祀られることとなった。

八郎太郎の旅
十和田湖を追われた八郎太郎は、鹿角で男神山と女神山の間をぬうように流れる米代川をせき止め鹿角を水没させ自らのすみかを作ろうとしようと、八郎太郎は近くの茂谷山をひもを使って動かそうとした。鹿角の42柱の神々はこれを知って驚き、大湯の西に集まって評定した。大湯環状列石の北西にある集宮（あつみや）神社はこのときに神々が集まった場所とされる。神々は八郎太郎に石のつぶてをぶつけることに決め、石を切り出すために花輪福士（臥牛）の日向屋敷にいた12人の鍛冶に金槌、ツルハシ、鏨などを沢山作らせ、牛に集宮まで運ばせた。途中あまり重たいので血を吐いて死ぬ牛がおり、そこは乳牛（チウシ）と現在呼ばれている。これに気づいた八郎太郎は、すみかをつくることをあきらめて茂谷山の中腹にかけた綱をほどいたが、その跡は現在も段になって残って見えるとされる。

八郎太郎は米代川を通って逃げ、途中七座山近くのネズミ袋で川を堰止め湖を作ろうとした。地元の8柱の神々が相談して一番賢い七座天神に任せることにした。天神と八郎太郎は大石を投げ、力比べをした。八郎太郎が投げた石は米代川の水中に落ちたが、天神が投げた石は対岸の天神の境内のある田まで飛んだ。八郎太郎は天神から天瀬川の方にもっと広い場所があることを聞き移動することを受け入れた。八郎太郎は一旦せき止めた堤防に、天神の使いの白鼠が穴を開けその流れに乗って下流に向かった。その際、白鼠を食べようとする猫を紐でつないでおいた地区が能代市二ツ井町小繋（猫つなぎ）地区である。

八郎潟の誕生
日本海附近まで来て、ようやく湖を作る適地が見つかったので、その支障となる天瀬川（あませがわ）（現・秋田県山本郡三種町天瀬川）の老夫婦の家を訪ね、明朝鶏が鳴くと同時に洪水が来るから避難するようにと伝え、湖を作り始めた。しかし姥は逃げる途中で麻糸（糸巻きという話もある）を忘れてきたことに気づき取りに戻った。そのとき、鶏が鳴き夫婦は逃げ遅れたため、八郎太郎はそれぞれ別々の岸へと放り投げて助けた。夫は湖の東岸の三倉鼻に、妻は北西岸に祀られている。出来上がった湖が八郎潟である。

辰子姫と田沢湖誕生
仙北郡の神成村に辰子（たつこ）という名の娘が暮らしていた。
辰子は類い希な美しい娘であったが、その美貌に自ら気付いた日を境に、いつの日か衰えていくであろうその若さと美しさを何とか保ちたいと願うようになる。辰子はその願いを胸に、観音菩薩に百夜の願掛けをした。必死の願いに観音が応え、山深い泉の在処を辰子に示した。そのお告げの通り泉の水を辰子は飲んだが、急に激しい喉の渇きを覚え、しかもいくら水を飲んでも渇きは激しくなるばかりであった。
狂奔する辰子の姿は、いつの間にか竜へと変化していった。自分の身に起こった報いを悟った辰子は、泉を広げて湖とし、そこの主として暮らすようになった。この湖が田沢湖である。
悲しむ辰子の母が、別れを告げる辰子を想って投げた松明が、水に入ると魚の姿をとった。これが田沢湖のクニマスの始まりという

八郎太郎と南祖坊の戦い（その2）、八郎太郎と辰子
八郎太郎は、いつしか辰子に惹かれ、田沢湖へ毎冬通うようになった。辰子もその想いを受け容れたが、ある冬、辰子の元に南祖坊が立っていた。辰子を巡って再度戦った結果、今度は八郎太郎が勝ちを収めた。それ以来八郎太郎は冬になる度、辰子と共に田沢湖に暮らすようになり、主が半年の間いなくなる八郎潟は年を追うごとに浅くなり、主の増えた田沢湖は逆に冬も凍ることなくますます深くなったのだという。
人間に姿を変えた八郎太郎の旅の途中、彼を泊めた旅籠では夜の間彼の部屋を見てはならないと言い含められ、覗き見た宿は必ず不幸に合うと言われていた。

物語の起源
室町時代の1407年（応永14年）に玄棟によって成立した説話集の『三国伝記』には三湖伝説の元になったと思われる説話が記録されている。巻12第12話は次のような話である。
中頃、播州書写山の辺りに、釈難蔵という法華の持者がいた。参詣すでに30度という熱心な熊野権現の信者だったが、生きながら弥勒の出生に会いたいと願い、3年間参籠して祈ったところ、千日目の夜「ただちに関東に下向して、常陸と出羽との境にある言両の山に住むならば、弥勒の下生に値遇できるであろう」との夢告があった。さっそくその山に行くと、頂には円形で底知れない深さの池があった。その畔で『法華経』を読誦していると、年のころ18、9の女性が毎日現れて聴聞する。難蔵が不思議に思っていると、女は「私の住処に来て衆生のために法華を読誦して欲しい」という。難蔵が「私はここで弥勒の出生を待っているのだから、よそには行けない」と断ると、女は「私はこの池の主の竜女です。竜は一生の間に千仏の出生に会うほど長命な生き物、私と夫婦になって弥勒の下生を待ってはいかが」という。難蔵はなるほどと思案をめぐらし、女とともに池に住むことにした。ある日、女がいうには「この山の三里西にある奴可の山の池にいる八頭の大蛇が私を妻にしていて、1月の上15日は奴可の池に住み、下15日はこの池に来るので、もうやってくる頃です」と。難蔵は少しも怯まず、『法華経』8巻を頭上に置いた。すると、難蔵の姿はたちまち九頭竜と変じ、八頭の大蛇と食い合うこと七日七夜、ついに八頭の大蛇が負けて大海に入ろうとしたが、大きな松が生じて邪魔をしたため、威勢も尽きて小身となり、もとの奴可の池に入った。いまでも言両の池の側で耳を澄ますと、波の下に読経の声が聞こえるという。
「中頃」とは、そう遠くない昔のことで、「釈難蔵」は「南祖坊」に相当し、「八頭の大蛇」は「八郎太郎」に相当する。「言両の山」は常陸と出羽の境にあるというが、常陸と出羽は境を接していない。菅江真澄は『いはてのやま』で、盛岡の永福寺の僧侶南層が八郎太郎を追い出して主になった伝説を記しているが、「しかはあれど」と続いて『三国伝記』のこの話を詳述している。しかし真澄も言両の山の位置関係には納得できず、言両の山は「陸奥の国と出羽の国の境」にあったと書き換えた上で、陸奥と常陸を書き間違っていると念を押し、言両の山は十和田湖、奴可は「八ツ耕田」（八甲田）ではないかと推定している。後に真澄は秋田を漫遊した後で十和田湖に実際に行った時の記録『十曲湖』では「言両」を削除し「奴可」は「齶田」（秋田）の湖と書き改めている。この結果、最初の湖は名前を語らないことでかえって十和田湖であることと、後の湖は八郎潟であるとの考えを明確にしている。
『三国伝記』の次に「三湖伝説」との類似性が指摘されるのは、『直談因縁集』5巻11である。1585年（天正13年）書写の『直談因縁集』は、日光輪王寺の天海蔵に伝来する直談系法華経注釈書である。津軽藩の歴史書『津軽一統志』（1727年、享保12年）には、「津軽と糠部の境糠壇の嶽に湖水有、十灣（とわだ）の沼と云ふ也、地神五代より始る也、數ヶ年に至て大同二年斗賀靈驗堂の宗徒南蔵坊と云法師、八龍を追出し十灣の沼に入る。今天文十五年まで及八百餘歳也」とあり、天文15年（1546年）を「今」と語っている。その年代に近い天正13年書写の『直談因縁集』の存在が、この伝承が東北の地に伝わっていたことを推測させる。『三国伝記』や『直談因縁集』は両書に共通した説話の場である天台教学の修練センターである天台談義所が全国規模で存在しており、そうした中から醸成された伝承が東北の地に伝播し影響を与えたものと考えられないだろうか。

十和田山青龍権現信仰
十和田湖はかつては信仰の湖であり、名の知れた霊地であった。南部藩や八戸藩ではこれを十和田山と呼び、湖中の十和田山青龍権現がその信仰の対象であった。それは、僧侶や山岳修行の場で民間の信仰登山、聖地巡礼の場であり、江戸時代は「額田嶽熊野山十湾寺」を称する神仏習合の寺院があって、十和田青龍権現（南祖坊）を本地仏として安置する仏堂「十和田御堂（みどう）」が建っていた。この堂は神仏分離に際して神社になり、今は十和田神社として、祭神はヤマトタケルになっている。十和田神社の右奥、岩山を登った先の台地（神泉苑）は、南祖坊が入定して青龍権現となったと伝わる中湖と、「カミ」が宿る御倉半島の「御室（奥の院）」をのぞむ神聖な場所であり、台地を降りた中湖の水際には、参拝者が占いと祈り、散供（さんぐ）打ちを行う「占場（オサゴ場）」があった。
宝暦の頃、南部藩の社堂を記載した『御領分社堂』では「十和田青龍権現」として、大同2年（807年）に南蔵坊という僧が、八郎太郎を追い出して、青龍大権現として小社に祀られていると記載されている。青森市油川の熊野神社にある1559年（永禄2年）の棟札に「熊野山十二所権現勧請於十彎寺」とある「十彎寺」はこの社の前身と思われ、少なくとも16世紀にはこの社の歴史が遡ることができ、同時に熊野修験が関係を持つことを示している。
1727年（享保12年）の『津軽一統志』では「津軽と糠部の境糠壇の嶽に湖水有、十灣（とわだ）の沼と云ふ也、地神五代より始る也、數ヶ年に至って大同二年斗賀靈驗堂の宗徒南蔵坊と云法師、八龍を追出し十灣の沼に入る。今天文十五年まで及八百餘歳也」とある。『邦内郷村志』（明和寛政年間、1764-1801年）には「相伝フ。往古永福寺ノ塔頭ニ南祖坊ナルモノアリ」として同じ話を簡略に説いている。『奥々風土記』（明治3-4年？）にもほぼ同じ記述がある。『吾妻むかし物語』（元禄年間、1688-1703年）では、南祖は糠部の生まれで幼名を糠部丸と呼び、永福寺の僧とも額田岳熊野十滝寺の僧ともある。菅江真澄の『十曲湖』（文化4年、1807年）では、永福寺の僧とも三戸郡科町龍現寺（科は斗賀の、龍現寺は霊現堂の誤りであろう）のほとりにいた大満坊という修験が南蔵坊と名を改めたとしている。鹿角では、安達太良山の麓の出身という異説もあると説いている。
南部藩では南祖坊が実在の法印さまとして、上下の信仰を集めていた。『祐清私記』では「南部利直が寝ている姿を見ると、蛇身に見えた」という話の後に「南部利直の夢に南祖坊が現れ私は蛇身を免れるために貴公に生まれ変わったと告げる。利直がこのことを次衆に告げると、これを真実と考える者が多かった。利直が寛永年間に江戸で没したが、その時国元の東禅寺の大英和尚と江戸の金地院が、それぞれ双方夢の話を全く知らなく、相談したわけでもないのに、同じく南宗院殿の号を撰んだ。利直が南祖坊の生まれ変わりであることはこれによっても明らかである。利直の葬儀が三戸で行われた時、空がにわかにかき曇って大雨電雷した」と書いている。。
南部藩においては、三湖物語の一方の雄である八郎太郎は敵役にとどまっていて、物語の主役を南祖坊に譲っている。南祖坊の物語は、奥羽地方の盲人たちによって琵琶や三味線などを伴奏として、いわゆる奥浄瑠璃などで神仏・社寺の縁起を説いた本地物の一つとして江戸時代に語られていた。天明（1781-1789年）の頃に、盛岡の本町にいた須磨都（すまいち）という座頭は十和田の本地を語り美声で名を知られていたという。奥浄瑠璃のほかに、南部の山伏や修験の徒がこれらの話を人々に語って聞かせていたのではないかと考えられる。
十和田の本地の記録は南部地方に数多く存在していたが、現在知られている十和田本地を『雨の神―信仰と伝説』では物語の形から3つに分類している。第一類は『十和田山本地由来』や『十和田由來記』、『十和田山由來記』『十和田山本地由来記』、『十和田山本地』、『十和田本地』、『十和田山本地記録』、『十和田山本地記録』、『十曲潟本地記録』、『十和田山青龍大権現』、『十和田山本地實記』などである。
第二類は『十和田記』や『十和田縁起』、『十和田由來記』、『十和田本地』、『奥州十和田山正一位青龍大権現御本地』、『奥州十和田山正一位大権現御本地』、『十和田御縁起』、『十和田本地』、『十和田湖開祖神之記』、『十和田大権現本地』、『十和田山縁起』、『姉戸由来記・十和田由来記』、『十和田山青龍大権現由来』、『十和田由来記』、『青龍大権現由来』などである。
第三類は『十和田神教記』、『十和田山神教記』、『十和田神教記実秘録』などである。これらは筆写年代がはっきりと分かっている最も古いものは、『奥州十和田山正一位青龍大権現御本地』の1801年（寛政16年）である。

三湖伝説第一類は、奥浄瑠璃として伝搬されたものと考えられる。中央からの移入された多くの奥浄瑠璃の物語とは明らかに異質で、在地的な伝承を基にして浄瑠璃的な粧いを凝らされたものと考えられる。
三湖伝説第二類の縁起では八郎太郎の先祖が秋田県大館市比内町独鈷の大日堂や鹿角市小豆沢の大日堂の別当であるとしている。『十和田由来記』では、八郎太郎の父の出身地は赤子とされ「とっこ」とルビがふられている。『十和田記』ではそれが赤谷とされている。ルビはないものの北沼が近くにあると記されていることから、それが大館市独鈷の大日堂であることが分かる。十和田信仰の宗派は熊野権現の天台宗であるが、秋田藩内にある独鈷の大日堂の宗派は現在真言宗である。中世、独鈷城周辺を支配していた比内浅利氏は天台宗を信仰していた。1441年（喜吉元年）の熊野の御師米良実報院の『願文』には「あさりの徳子（独鈷）之入道但阿弥（ただあみ）、子息隆慶、合力善阿弥、先達は遊里（由利）住公良春」とある。しかし、『浅利軍記』では独鈷の大日堂は真言宗であると記録されている。そして、江戸時代の秋田藩の政策は真言宗派であった。佐竹氏の水戸時代の第15代当主佐竹義舜の長子である永義は庶腹の子であったので僧籍に入れられた。それを嫌った永義は父義舜の立腹叱責をかえりみず今宮神社において俗籍にかえり元服し今宮姓を名のる。のち永義は天台宗の聖護院につき山伏修験となり、水戸藩内の山伏に対して役銀をとり、山伏の犯罪を成敗する治外法権的支配権を得た。永義の長子の光義は跡目相続をして、常州寺山の城主と同時に山伏修験の頭領になった。光義は大和の大峯山でも修行をして、遂には関東地方全域の頭領の職につき常蓮院と名乗った。1602年佐竹義宣が秋田に転封されると光義は62歳で今宮一族を連れて随行し、平鹿郡増田に住み、まもなく角館に移り63歳で没した。佐竹氏が秋田に転封されると天台宗の聖護院は「羽州は遠国であるから関東の山伏支配は不能である」と一方的に関東一円の山伏支配権を取り上げた。佐竹氏は聖護院と断交して真言宗についた。
『十和田記』では秋田の赤谷という所の大日堂の別当了観という者の女房に、北沼の大蛇が通って急苗という子を産ませた、その九代目の子孫が八郎であるとし、三代目の急苗は先祖が大日堂の別当であった縁によって、小豆沢大日堂の別当を建立したが、大日如来は彼を憎んで請けられず、草木村の民家に落ちて六代にして八郎が生まれたとしている。これは『奥州十和田山正一位青龍大権現御本地』や『十和田本地』（第ニ類）などにも見える（ただし、急苗は久内となっている）。高谷重夫はこれを急苗（久内）は秋田の修験であったため、南部修験の管下にある小豆沢大日堂の別当になることを許されなかったのではないかとした。小豆沢の大日堂は現在は大日霊貴神社となっているが、この社の代々の別当の阿倍氏は、先祖は修験であると称している。この家の系図では、八代目の義守の時、天台僧形たるべしと宣旨を蒙って、養老山喜徳寺顕壽院となった。
『角川日本地名大辞典 2 青森県』の「十和田神社」の項目では三湖伝説は「天台宗修験者と真言宗修験者の宗門上の争いがあったことが、南蔵坊と八郎太郎の争いに仮託されて伝承されたものであろう」としている。高瀬博は「これは羽黒系山伏と熊野系山伏の勢力争いで、熊野系の南祖ノ坊の勝利とみるべきものである」としている。井上隆明は、南祖坊は熊野修験、三戸郡名川霊験堂、同郡五戸町永福寺からして天台宗。湖争いで南祖坊の勝利は、真言文化圏の敗北を表すだろうと記している。高谷重夫は八郎の縁起を奉じる一派の修験があって、それが南部の山伏と相対していて、そのことと本地譚にみられる南祖坊の勝利、八郎太郎の敗北と逃走の物語が照応するのではなかろうかとしている。
物語の多くで南祖坊の師匠が所属する寺院の後継である盛岡永福寺は現在真言宗である。また、斗賀霊験堂も現在真言宗であるが、元々天台宗の寺院であったようである。永福寺は真言宗でありながら、寺持ちの観音堂が天台宗本山派修験のものであった。五戸七崎の観音堂は永福寺持ちの観音堂で、善行院、当圓坊、覚圓坊、覚善坊の四人の修験がいて、この四人が本山派（天台宗）の山伏で、「拙寺」（永福寺）の配下であったことが『御領分社堂』の記事で分かる。
独鈷大日堂や小豆沢大日堂とだんぶり長者伝説と通じて縁が深い岩手県二戸市浄法寺町の天台寺（天台宗）は915年の三湖物語との関連が語られている十和田火山の大噴火によって成立した可能性が語られている。また、十和田火山の大噴火が原因となった米代川の火山灰による白い濁りは、民話ではそのだんぶり長者伝説と結び付けられている。
十和田湖休屋に置かれた十湾寺を南部藩はここで参拝しない熊野派山伏には行者資格を与えず、外からの勢力に対し山伏を保護し、十和田湖周辺には他勢力を寄せ付けなかった。そのため、出羽（津軽？）の山伏ははるか御鼻部山から参拝して戻るしかなかった。また、明治時代初期に初めて休屋を開拓した栗山新兵衛の目的は、南部藩と犬猿の仲であった津軽藩に対する国境警備のための屯田開発が最大の理由であった。十湾寺への参拝者は江戸時代には南部藩領の全域からが主になっていたが、他に八戸藩からと、遠く仙台藩（奥州市）からの参拝者もいた。しかし、津軽藩や秋田藩からの参拝者は記録されていない。

各地の八郎太郎伝説
十和田湖を追われた八郎太郎が新しいすみかを求めてあちこちを探し回った伝説は沢山ある。来万山を越え移動し、三戸岳の下滝川をせき止めて三戸郡を大潟にしようとしたが、長谷の観音や諏訪明神など沢山の神仏が攻撃してきたのであきらめた。故郷の鹿角の米代川の岩の脇をせきとめようとしたが、花輪の48の神仏が集宮神社で相談して、八郎太郎を攻撃した。八郎は男鹿半島まで逃げそこで小さな潟に住み、次第に大きくしたのが八郎潟である。八郎太郎は秋田で八竜大明神として祀られ、冬は田沢湖に春分まで住み、春になると八郎潟に戻ってきて氷が溶け漁ができるようになり、沿岸の人々は八郎太郎を祀るようになったという。秋田城下に御用商人の潟屋伊左衛門という者がいたが、八郎太郎が秋田に逃げてきたとき、八郎は八郎潟の近くに住んでいた潟屋邸に泊まった。夜更けになると八郎は自分の正体を証言し、「この辺を大潟にしようと思っています。近所の人にも教えて早く立ち退いて下さい。その後はみなさんをお守りしましょう」と言う。炉の中に火箸を立てて引き抜くと、水がこんこんと湧き出して来る。主人らは慌てて翌日から高い所に移った。その後、主人は潟屋を屋号にして秋田に住むと秋田の分限者として栄えた。潟屋は春秋の彼岸に八郎大明神の神霊が来ると言って注連縄を張って祭りをする。城下に再三の火災があっても潟屋だけは罹災しないという。
他に渡辺村男の『八戸見聞録』（昭和17年、1942年）には、八戸の蛍が崎を八郎潟崎と呼び、ここにある沼を八太郎沼（この沼は現在埋め立てられている）と言ったという伝説が記載されている。工藤白竜の『津軽俗説集』（寛政年間）では（北津軽郡）相内村には八の太郎という杣子（木こり）がいて、岩魚を一人でたべ異形となり、十三湖に入ろうとしたがカッパに追われ平川の淵に入ろうとしたが、またもカッパに追われ、最後には八郎潟で安住したという伝説が記載されている。『新撰陸奥国説』では、目屋沢に八郎と呼ばれる杣人がいて、あるとき一匹の魚を食い、川の水を飲み干すと、全身に鱗が生えた。十和田こそが我が住処とそこに行くと、南蔵坊が住んでいて入ることができない。そのため剣が鼻（大鰐）に来て、大堤を築こうとすると、温泉に野丑と山丑という兄弟がいて、彼らが大日如来に祈願すると両人角を得て丑となり、八郎に突進し秋田に追い出し、八郎がせき止めようとした木材はそのまま石になったという伝説が記載されている。
八郎太郎が新天地を求めようとした場所はこの他にも北上川の高水寺付近（岩手県紫波町）で権現に止められて花輪に移った話もある。また、新井田川の上流の島守盆地で、地主神や虚空蔵や諸神仏に追われたが、八郎太郎がモッコで土を運んだところが、一モッコ、二モッコとして地名に残っているとされる。また、階上岳をひっぱって住処を作ろうとしてひっくり返った所が浜名だという伝説もある。馬渕川を赤石沢と竜の口の間に三戸の城山を担いで来たが、諏訪の神に止められた話もあり、轟木のトンネル付近のくぼみは八郎の足跡だという。また三戸郡倉石村のはなれ森は、八郎太郎が十和田湖に行く途中に五戸川の水をせき止めて沼にしようとしてモッコで担いだ跡で、山上に薬師堂があるという。中津軽郡相馬村の鉢呑沢の炭焼の八郎が、作沢川を止めて住もうとしたが、不動明王に止められて秋田に移ったという話も残されている。秋田県大館市比内町扇田中野籾内沢口にある岩山はまるはげの岩の面を年中乾くことなく涙を流したように水が少しずつ流れていて泣面山と言われている。八郎太郎が南祖坊に敗れ最後の一策として八面沢から達子森を背負って七座山に向かった時、神たちが一計をめぐらしたので八郎太郎は達子森を現在の所に捨てて逃げたという。この時、中野の薬師神は高い所にあったので神たちの相談の時に欠席したので、神たちは怒り薬師森から薬師神を引きずりおろし、その時薬師神は倒れウドで目を突いて涙が流れ現在の泣面山になったという。大渕岱の下流に長さ約10m幅3mの長持形をした巨石が岩瀬川の中央にあった。人はこれを長持石と名付けた。これは八郎太郎が七座山と蝙山にダムを建設しようと心がけ、ほぼ出来たころで水口に必要な手頃な石が見当たらず、物色したところ岩瀬川の繋沢に恰好の石を発見し、運んでくると水が引けている。それに気づいた八郎太郎は石をその場所に置いて小繋に行くと、天神の命令で白ネズミの為ダムは破れていた。
岩手県浄法寺町では八郎太郎がテシロ森をアオウミ橋のところに持っていって沼を作ろうとした。しかし観音様に止められたので岩を投げると観音様に届く前に天台寺の参道に落ちて地面がバクバクと揺れたのでそこをバクバクというようになった。イタコが浄法寺町から青森に通う時に、八の太郎があまりにもいたずらをするので、見つからないように石を飛ばし、次第に大きな石を投げて邪魔をした。それがイタコ石という山になった。八郎太郎はイタコにさとされて、降伏して謝ったという。岩手県九戸郡軽米町には、小軽米の円子の雲谷川の岸近くにドンドン森と称する円墳型の小丘がある。この丘は八郎太郎が東海岸の方からやってくる途中、草履の裏についた泥を地に踏み叩きながらふるい落とした跡だという。また、八郎太郎は正午近くになって折詰丘に腰をかけて太平洋に手を伸ばして海底の貝類をさらって昼食とした、その貝殻をあたりに捨ててまだどこかに去っていったとする。久慈市大川目村の荒津前平に八郎太郎という少年がいた。ある時、森の中の泉を手ですくって飲もうとすると手の中にはイモリが入っていた。思い切って飲んでしまうと、太郎は8、9尺もある大男になりひとまたぎに20-30間も歩けるようになった。太郎が大きなモッコで土を配って川を塞ぎ止めた水を飲んだ。その時の跡が小久慈大沢田のモッコ山である。草履に泥水がいっぱいついていたので落としたら小高い丘になった。これが小久慈の山本にある草履森である。太郎は大川目村山口から久慈、夏井、大野方面のかけて用水路を掘ることにした。1掘りで20-30間の堰ができた。何里か掘って小高い丘で休んで昼食を食った。そこは昼場（ヒリーバ）という地名になっている（久慈港北方約5町）。太郎は長い用水路を作ったのでうぬぼれた。ある夕方青森県の是川の近くに南部某という者に力比べ知恵比べを挑んだが彼の家来にも負けてしまう。1足の金の草鞋をもらい、これが切れる所まで行ってそこで暮らせと言われる。太郎は秋田の海岸の村に着くと草鞋がぷっつり切れた。老夫婦に宿を頼むと快く迎えてくれる。夕食が終わり太郎が炉に長い火箸をつっこんでかきまわすとどんどん水が湧いてくる。太郎は老夫婦を近くの山に避難させ、更にかき回すと水は恐ろしい勢いで湧き、そうして八郎潟ができ、太郎はそこの主になった。九戸郡大野村阿子木にカラツチコという盆地形の沢山がある。昔八郎太郎がここに入ろうとしたが駄目で、やむなく秋田に行ったという。岩手県松尾村野駄字砂田に八郎という少年がいた。2人の友達と前森山に行く。ある沼から流れる小川のほとりに小屋をかけてシナノキの皮をはいだ。その後3匹のイワナを食べた八郎は喉がかわき沼の水を飲み干した。沼は今はアセ沼と称し、全く水がなく谷地のようになっている。八郎はすみかを作ろうと、鬼清水の付近の小山をおろして堤を作ろうとするが、岩手山上の田村大明神のとがめを受けて果たせず、十和田湖に行って主になった。背負って来た森は八郎森という。盛岡永福寺に南祖坊という修験者がいて、熊野山で自分の所有地を請ったところ、鉄の草鞋を与えられ、それの切れたところを棲家となせと言われた。十和田湖畔でマヲという鳥が鳴いていたのでその姿を見ようと探しているうちに草鞋の緒が切れた。岩手県雫石町の東に七つ森という山がある。かつて鹿角の山男といわれる巨人が雫石盆地をせき止めて湖水を作ろうとし、この山を背負いかけたこれを見た岩手山の権現が怒り神戦さが７日７晩あった。八の太郎が負けて秋田に逃げ帰ったという。この山にある巨石巨岩は権現様がオヤマから投げてよこしたものだという。八の太郎が背負うためにかけた担ぎ縄の跡というくびれの跡や尻を押し付けた窪みがある。また麓には足跡がある。八の太郎の煙草の吸殻を落とした所だともいう。西山村字長山の七ツ田には同じような窪みが7つあってこれも八の太郎の煙草の吸殻を落とした所だという。紫波郡紫波町では志和町の南宗坊という者が、2人の仲間とともにマダの木を剥ぎに沢内に行ったという話になっている。土館の馬の子という小沼に来て湖を造ろうとするが、東の方の金山沢の方が低かったのでできず、米沢に移る。その後鹿角の十和田湖に行って八の太郎を追ってそこの主になった。佐比内村に八郎太郎という者がいた、小山のような土塊を背負って来て、横森の狭間を堰き止めて湖水を作り棲む所にしようとしたが、南宗坊に妨げられてそのまま十和田に逃げ去った。川原町鴨目田にある丘陵はその時持ってきたものである。水沢の西方に経塚と呼ぶ高山がある。その麓に八郎沼というのがある。昔、兄弟がいた。弟の八郎はある日経塚の麓の辺りに木伐りに行き、小池にいた魚をとって焼いて食った。ところが、喉が乾いて耐えられなくなって小池の水を掬って飲んだ。すると池が崩れて大きな沼になり八郎を呑んでしまった。兄は八郎を探しに行き、大きな沼の岸に出た。沼の中から大蛇が臼ほどの大きな顔を出して八郎であることを告げた。和賀郡沢内村ではこの地の八郎という者が、岩魚を三匹食べて大男になる。秋田の西海岸まで行き大きな湖の主になろうと飛び込んだ。兄から話を聞いた八郎の妻のタコは、薪を背負い松明にして訪ね歩いた。大きな湖に出ると、松明を沼に投げ捨てて湖に入水した。八郎が入った湖を八郎潟といい、タコが入水した沼をタコ潟（田子潟）という。下閉伊郡田老町では、畑に3人の兄弟が住んでいた。八郎はその末子であった。3人は肘葛の山にマダ剥ぎにでかけた。八郎は3匹の岩魚を食べて、喉が乾き水をのみ大男になった。畑の壁ヶ沢の沼代に居をかまえようとした。そうこうしているうちにも体は太るだけであった。ここを止めて畑の北にある、小本川の方にでかけた。下岩泉の赤穴付近を枕にして寝てみたところ、その足は小本海岸の竜甲の岩についていた。その後、八郎は十和田湖の主と戦ったが敗れ、秋田の三吉神とも戦ったが敗れ。帰る途中にある村の老夫婦が貧乏な生活をしていた。八郎は貧乏な者を助けない悪い村だとし、村を沼にするから早く行きなさいといって、囲炉裏に火箸をさしこんでぐるぐる回した。村は一晩のうちに大湖水になり、老夫婦は避難し他の村で幸福に暮らしたという。大湖水は今の八郎潟だという。
魚を食べて蛇になった伝説も各地に残されている。山形県西田川郡温海町では、八郎太郎は越沢の生まれてあったが、岩魚を食べた結果、大蛇となって大雨を降らせ八郎潟に行き、その主になったとも言われている。戸部正直の『奥羽永慶軍記』（元禄11年、1698年）では、八郎潟がまだ山林であったころ、八郎というキコリが沢辺で魚を捕って大蛇になりここを潟となして、主になったとされている。岡見知愛の『柞山峯之嵐』(延享元年、1744年)ではそれと同じく八郎潟単独で語られている。工藤白龍の『津軽風俗選』後拾遺（寛政7年、1795年）では八郎は十三潟に入ろうとして河伯（河の神）に追われ、八郎潟で安住したとされる。内田邦彦の『津軽口碑集』（昭和4年、1929年）に引く話は、弘前に沼を作ろうとして大日に頼むと鶏が鳴くまで沼を作れば許すという。大日は快く思わず鶏の鳴き声を真似る。八郎は工事を放棄し秋田に向かい潟の主になった。

十和田さま
『新撰陸奥国誌』（天正年間、1573年-1592年）には、黒石市沖浦の貴船神社には十和田に入ろうとした南祖坊が先に八竜がいたのでこの神社に来たという伝説が語られている。その他、小舘衷三の研究によれば、青森県下では十和田さまと言われる社が数多く、その祭神は龍神であり、干ばつ時には雨乞いをする場合が多かった。ただ、現在は公には貴船神社と称して祭神もそれに見合う神名になっているものもあるが、それは明治以降の改変である。例えば、大鰐町の貴船神社は旧名を十和田宮と呼び、現在でも単に十和田さまといえば津軽ではこの宮を指す。この宮は津軽の十和田さまの中では最も著名であるが、干ばつには鶴田町や浪岡町などの遠方からこの社に雨乞いに来た。また、藩政期には藩命によってこの社で雨乞いが行われた。黒石市の青荷沢の十和田さまも貴船神社になっているが、『貴船神社由来伝記』では晴雨を祈願する社として、南祖坊が龍神となってこの社の池に入った話を伝えている。青森市西田沢の山中にある十渡明神宮も竜神を祀る十和田さまの一つであるが、雨乞いでは社の前で盆の踊りをした。このように津軽地方では十和田さまを雨の神とされた。しかし、本家の青龍権現や南部地方で十和田さまを雨の神としての祀る事例はなく明確な信仰の違いがある。なお、津軽の十和田さまには必ず池があり、そこで散供打ちの行事が伴っていて、池や沼、時には水たまりを十和田さまと呼ぶこともある。
青森県内の代表的な十和田さまは黒石市青荷沢、弘前市取上、南津軽郡浪岡町吉野田、南津軽郡大鰐町三ツ目内、東津軽郡蟹田町桂渕などで、水神系の堂社が200を超える。五所川原市飯詰村の雨池では汚物を投げ入れ、西目屋村の白沢沼では稲藁のふんどしをした男女が水辺で相撲を取り、近くの権現堂では赤いふんどしをした女子が裸踊りをし、青森や浅虫の夢宅寺では雨降り地蔵を川に入れ痛めつけ、金木町川倉では山頂の雨願岩に人形を捧げ、この人形を流すほど雨を降らせてくださいと祈る。江戸時代の津軽藩の画家、平尾魯仙の『谷の響』につぎのような文章がある。天保14年卯、碇ヶ関の大落前の岸、崩れおちて水理を塞ぎ、水湛えてさながら沼の如くなりしに、土人（土地の人）十和田と称して参拝する者多かり、津軽方言に、山中の窪凹に水を湛えて沼を成すもの、土人、十和田という。
秋田県には大館市長坂字大橋にある戸潟神社北東側にあるとわだ之沢の滝壺下の戸潟沼という沼がある。山崩れによってできた底なし沼と言われ、雨乞いに霊験あらたかとされ戦時中までは旱魃が続けば近在の参拝者で賑わった場所である。紅葉が素晴らしく、小十和田の趣があったが、戦後は手入れもなされず昔の面影はない。この、とわだの沼は国道7号からわずか300mほど沢に入ったとわだ神社（戸潟神社）の下側の沼である。周囲わずか300mほどの沼の小沼に過ぎないが、昔は日照り続きの年は近郷近在から雨乞いの人々が大勢押しかけ神社の境内で女相撲をとったり、沼の端で焚き火をしたり、沼に不浄のものを投げ入れたりして怒らせ、神の力で雨を呼ぼうとした。

秋田の八郎太郎伝説
八郎潟周辺では八郎太郎が広く信仰されていた。
三倉鼻の岩屋では乙殿権現の祠と並んで八郎太郎が祀られている。南秋田郡八郎潟町の一日市、夜叉袋、浦横、五城目、山本郡琴丘町などの広い地域から村人が酒肴持参で来て、酒盛りをしながら雨を祈った。肴は必ず鶏肉であったばかりではなく、鶏の生首を持参し、宴が盛になると岩屋の壁にその血をなすりつける。八郎は鶏が大嫌いであったから、こうして彼を怒らせ嵐を招いて雨を降らせようとした。八郎が鶏を嫌いなのは、八倉山 の麓で川をせき止めようとしたときに、いくら築いても夜明けになって鶏が鳴くと堰が崩れてしまったからだという。このため琴丘町天瀬川や八竜町芦崎では戦前まで鶏を飼わなかった。また、三倉鼻には鬢水（びんすい）入れという井戸の近くに龍神祠があって、天瀬川の人たちが11月20日を龍神の日と呼んで祭りをしている。
八郎潟は八龍湖とも呼ばれ、湖そのものが八龍の宮とされた。以下に八郎を祀った神社を挙げる。男鹿市船越の八郎神社（八龍大権現）は、潟周辺の八郎社としては最も大きいものである。1847年（弘化4年）に京都の吉田家から位を下された、神社として崇めるようになったので、それまでは小祠であったのだろう。南秋田郡八郎潟町一日市の八龍神社（八大龍王）ではこの地の漁師が講を作り、毎日2日の縁日に当人の家で講を務める、1月2日には潟端（馬場、目川、川口）の八郎潟に講員が参拝して、潟の仕事は一切休んで漁具にも神酒を供えて豊漁を祈った。南秋田郡昭和町野村の八郎神社では雨乞いが行われたこともある。1967年から始まった八郎祭りでは作り物の龍の「八郎龍」を男子が「辰子龍」を女子が担ぎ奉納する。他に、天瀬川には八龍大権現が、鯉川には八郎神社が、山谷には山神社境内に八郎神社が、鹿渡には龍神堂が（松庵寺境内にあって、男鹿市小浜の原田氏の先祖が海中から拾い上げた龍神をこの寺の和尚が貰い受けて祀ったもの。付近の漁師が龍神講をつくり祭っている）、八竜町安戸と追泊、芦崎、若美町鵜木（稲荷神社境内）、五明光（稲荷神社境内）、宮沢（眺光寺境内）、野石（八幡社境内）、八ツ面、福米沢（熊野神社境内）には八郎祠がある。八竜町富岡と久米岡には八郎神社がある。
雄勝郡稲川町の井上武兵衛が1845年（弘化2年）に著した『夜籠雑談噺』では、八郎太郎は元は南部藩の赤森村の与八郎という人物である。与八郎はイワナを食べ大蛇になり仲間と別れたあと天神に相談し、山を少し降りたところの神手洗の沼に住所を移した。しかしそこも、野鼠に穴を空けられて南治郎坊に降参した。与八郎は男鹿新山、本山によい潟があると天神に紹介され、両社に十年の間貸してほしいと願い出た。その時、十年の約束証文を取り交わす際に、与八郎は八郎と改名し、気をきかせて十の字の上に点を一つ打ち、千年の証文とした。今はその沼は八郎潟になった。
南部や津軽では三湖物語は南祖坊と八郎太郎の物語に終始しているが、秋田ではこの物語に続いて田沢湖のタツ子との関わりが語られている。例えば、南部藩の松井道円が著したとされる『吾妻むかし物語』（元禄年間、1688-1703年）では八郎は出羽国の比内郡を潟としそこに棲み、仙北郡生（保）内の潟（田沢湖）にも棲家があり、一年おきに両湖を往復すると記述するが、この書ではタツ子の話はでてこない。それに対して、岡見知愛の『柞山峯之嵐』1744年ではタツ子の名前は出てこないが、田沢湖には八郎の妻神が棲んでいるとしている。人見蕉雨の『黒甜瑣語（こくてんさご）』 （寛政10年、1798年）ではタツ子は神成沢の常厳坊が女、隺子（つるこ）とされ田沢湖と八郎潟には水脈がつながっていて、二匹の龍は年に一度は行き来していると記される。また『黒甜瑣語』の別の記述では、春分の頃に年に一回二龍が出会う日は、湖中の氷が裂けて魚鱗にような形に祠から諏訪湖のような神渡りが起きることを地元民が見ることもあるとされている。
これらの書籍は物語の一部分が記述されているだけだが、秋田叢書に収録されている『三倉鼻略縁記』（安政5年、1858年）では、八郎太郎が竜になり南祖坊と戦って、八郎太郎がタツ子に通うまでの一連の物語が、八郎太郎が八郎潟を作る際に出会った老夫婦がいた三倉鼻の伝説などと一緒に語られている。三倉鼻とは、今の南秋田郡八郎潟町と山本郡三種町の境にある突兀とした山で、西側は八郎潟に突き出していた。現状は鉄路や道路で二分されているが、かつては険路で旅人は山越えに苦労した。老夫婦は、夫が南秋田郡八郎潟町の夫健現ノ宮、妻が山本郡三種町の姥御前大明神として祀られているが、これは出雲のアシナヅチ・テナヅチとの関連性が語られている。秋田の伝説では、八郎太郎の生まれは鹿角の草木村であるとするものが多いが、『三倉鼻略縁記』では「八郎」の生まれを南部八戸糠塚村としている。また、ヒロインのタツ子は「龍子」と記載されていて、八郎が「南蔵坊」に負け、敗走し、老夫婦を助け八郎潟を作り、そして龍子の元に通うまでの物語が、三倉鼻の峠にあった茶屋の主人が旅人に語る形で表されている。ほとんど同じ内容の書が田沢湖町の高橋氏が所蔵していた『三倉鼻由来』（明治2年、1869年）である。これらの書は幕末安政期に秋田の寺子屋の教本として使われていた。『三倉鼻由来』の最大の特徴はタツ子の名前である。『三倉鼻由来』ではそれが「靏子（つるこ）」になっており、明治2年の写本ではあるが、元はより古い時代に書かれた書物であることがわかる。秋田の寺子屋の教本として秋田県立図書館には上記2書と同じ内容の『三倉鼻名所記』という書が保管されている。この書は漢字に全てふりがながふられており、最後のページにはことわざが3つ記載されていることからも、元は寺子屋の教本として使われていたことが分かる。
昭和になってから、秋田魁新報の記者などを務めた斎藤隆介が著した創作民話『八郎』は、地元の大男「八郎」が日本海の荒波から人々を救うために自己犠牲によって八郎潟と寒風山を生み出したとする三湖伝説とは一線を画した独自の解釈に基づいており、国語教科書にも採用された。

田沢湖の辰子伝説
田沢湖町院内金ヶ澤の常光坊の娘に金靏子という娘がいた。今日一般には、田沢湖のヒロインは辰子（タツ子）と呼ばれている。これは、金靏子（鶴子）が16-17歳の若さを保つために、龍と化して田沢湖の主になったことが語り継がれているうちに龍子に変化したものと考えられる。

田沢湖伝説の最も古いものを残している亨保時代の『田沢鳩留尊仏菩薩縁記』には、八郎太郎の逢瀬や三湖伝説が一連のものであることは語られていない。そして、その関連を付けたのは武藤鉄城は修験者や熊野の語り部であるとしている。
辰子の名前の変遷については、武藤鉄城は「その湖がタッコ潟と称されたことから、女主人公のタッ子が生まれたものであると考えている。そしてタッコ潟の語源は湖畔の田子ノ木部落の名から出たものであり、更にその田子ノ木なる地名は『タッコフ』即ち『水辺に円錐形の小山がある所』を意味する石器時代の言葉から出たものと解釈している」としている。それ以前には、「金鶴子」や「亀鶴子」とされていた。その証拠に湖水唯一の吐口である潟尻川付近の近江八景の浮見堂に似た湖中にある漢槎宮の祭神は京都から「金鶴姫之命」（金鶴子様）と命名されたご本尊があるからである。
これに対し井上隆明は、八郎太郎は真言宗系の説話であるが、辰子姫は天台宗系で、現在の辰子姫の名は江戸後期の文人による当て字だとし、地元ではタッコ姫と促音で発音されることから、古くからタッコ姫→棲居地のタッコ潟→田沢湖とされたと言われてきたが、タッコは田子・田処・田所・竹生（たこう）でかんがい用水をひく湖沼の意味だろうから、タッコ潟→その主のタッコ姫でなければならないとし、「タッコ」のアイヌ語語源説を否定している。
奥州藤原氏が滅亡した後、源頼朝によって新たな東北地方の支配者として鎌倉御家人が派遣された。その時に、熊野信仰を伴っていたと考えられる。13世紀から14世紀にかけて熊野神社系の熊野語り部が、熊野神社の縁起や語り物を携えて東北地方を唱導して歩き、それが定着して各地の伝説になった。熊野系の物語の代表的なものが「義経記」で、その中に義経の妻が山形県瀬見温泉の対岸亀割で「カメツル子」を産んだとしている。別の説では義経の恋人が「皆鶴（みなつる）」である。中世の熊野系説話の女主人公が一貫して「皆鶴」から「カイツル」となり「カメツル」と変化している。「亀鶴」は中世の巫女系の説話に多い名称で、女神官である巫女にも「ツルコ」の名が多い。神社の神官から離れて、諸国をさすらいながら宗教の宣伝をした巫女はいわゆる「歩き巫女」と呼ばれ、秋田では盲目でない巫女は「アサヒイチコ」と呼ばれていた。これらの女流唱導者が辰子の物語を創作し伝えていった可能性が高い。また「八郎伝説」はそれに対して男性唱導者の熊野聖によって創作されたのではないだろうか。

十和田火山との関わり
この三湖伝説は、実際に起きた自然災害との関わりが指摘されている。915年十和田湖にあった火山は2000年来最大とも言われる大噴火を起こす。この噴火によってもたらされた噴火降下物は各地で堆積し、自然のダムを造った。ダムは周囲を水浸しにしながらも最終的に決壊し、各地で大洪水を起こす。秋田県北秋田市の胡桃館遺跡もこの時の洪水によって地下に埋まった遺跡である。そして、まさにこの被害を受けた地区に八郎太郎の伝説が残っているのである。
たとえば、南祖坊と八郎太郎の七日七晩の戦いは、稲妻を投げ合ったり、法力を駆使したりの壮絶なものであるとする表現があるが、これが十和田湖火山の噴火の様子を記述しているという人もいる。また、七座山の伝説に残っている「白鼠」は火山降下物が堆積し流れ下るシラス洪水なのではないかと指摘されている。
このことは、1966年に平山次郎・市川賢一によって「1000年前のシラス洪水」という論文で発表された。この論文は八郎太郎の伝説を十和田噴火と結びつけた初めての論文であると考えられる。
1912年（明治45年）の『荷上場郷土誌』（石井修太郎）でも、三湖伝説は火山の噴火によるものであると指摘されている。火山から流れた土砂が「白土」という灰白土で、米代川沿岸に限りこの白土があることを指摘しており、噴火後数百年間米代川が白濁し、その伝説がだんぶり長者伝説として残されたのではないかとしている。さらに、米代川沿岸から白土の流出によって、家具や陶器、大木が出土することもその証拠とした。
山田村村史に次のような記述がある。「大同2年（807年）平城天皇の朝、陸中鹿角郡の熊澤岳破裂して当村（現秋田県大館市山田）の東南に月山（大館市山田 月山神社）、松峯山、女山の三山を出現し加ふるに諸所に山津浪起り、当村の辺惨状を呈したり、ために蝦夷はことごとく後を絶ちたりと伝ふ。現今諸所に大木の埋没しあるは当時の惨状の片影なりといふ。なお白土もその際の火山灰の飛散し来たれるものなりと伝ふ。」鹿角郡の蒸ノ湯温泉は昔は熊沢の湯と言った。八幡平の麓に熊沢部落がある所から名付けたものだろう。この熊沢岳の破裂とは八幡平一帯の爆発のことと想像される。これによって空中に飛散する塵埃が雲を呼び、集中豪雨となって爆発の灰を流したのが軽石岱（現大館市岩瀬上軽石岱周辺 山瀬小学校の周辺）の軽石やその東向かいの善知鳥（現大館市岩瀬善知鳥坂）の白土さらに旧下川沿村川口地内の軽石など米代川流域一帯のもので、この事については米沢次男先生（故人）の書かれた山田村村史にもあるが、その時の洪水は柏木の月山（大館市山田 月山神社）の一の鳥居まであふれたと今に伝われている。
(早川由紀夫 1997)では、915年の大噴火の根拠は『扶桑略記』に「7月5日の朝日が月のようだったので人々は不思議に思った。13日になって出羽の国から、灰が降って2寸積もった、桑の葉が各地で枯れとの報告があった」（暦はいずれも宣明暦）という記録としている。下流の胡桃館遺跡に、902年の年輪を持つ杉材が火山灰におおわれていることも根拠としている。また、火山灰が十和田火山の西側や南側に流れているのは、この地区の夏の季節風であるやませによるものとしていて、「八郎太郎ものがたり」はこの時の噴火の模様をあらわしたものとしている。
十和田火山の915年の大噴火は、日本の歴史書に直接記載されていない。田中俊一郎はこれを878年の元慶の乱の経緯で「異説」の立場を採り、米代川流域が蝦夷の「秋田河以北を己が地となさん」という要求が通り、彼らのものになったからではないかとした。その証拠として胡桃舘遺跡から発掘された板状木簡や土器が大和朝廷支配地には見られないことなどを根拠としている。
米代川流域では過去たくさんの埋没家屋が出土している。

江戸時代の1817年（文化14年）に黒沢(二階堂)道形は『秋田千年瓦』で北秋田市脇神字小ヶ田から出土した埋没家屋を元に、三湖伝説やこの地区の地形の変化を考察している。
また、江戸時代の長崎七左衛門による古文書に次のような記載がある。1817年6月の洪水で北秋田市脇神字小ヶ田から埋没家屋が出土し、埋没家屋が破損せず障子の板に墨で描いた牡丹の絵があるなど、埋まる前のそのままの形で出てきたことから、これは地震や山崩れではなく、七座神社の縁起にある「大同2年（807年）六月二十一日、潟の八郎という異人が七倉山の所で米代川をせき止め、鷹巣盆地は三年にわたって水底となった」より、このため埋没家屋が出来たという説を紹介している。また、今まで埋没家屋が出たのは34軒だとしている。七座神社の縁起というのは『七倉山天神縁起』のことで1766年（明和3年）に神宮寺烈光によって記された書だが、実は弟の般若院英泉が起草したもので、北秋田市綴子の内舘文庫にはその草稿が残されている。さらに、ほとんど同じ内容の複数の書が大館市栗盛記念図書館に所蔵されている。菅江真澄や黒沢道形は小勝田の埋没家屋の成因は天長地震だと言い切っているし、昭和時代にも地震学者の今村明恒も地震説を唱えている。それに対して、長崎七左衛門は埋没家屋を実際に見分し水没説を採っている。
当時の被災者の状況は長崎七左衛門は埋没家屋の状態から「棚の上に犬の骨らしきもの1本、あるいは、家の中には神棚仏壇も、家財道具も生き物の骨すらないのは、早くに高台に逃れたからだろう」と推測している。また秋田藩の奉行だった瀬谷五郎右衛門は、大披から出土した埋没家屋のなかには、机の足に「永正8年（1511年）末8月」という日付が書かれていたものがあることを記録している。
2015年に発見された片貝家ノ下遺跡では、屋根の残存する伏屋形式の竪穴建物が検出された。遺跡全体の10%程度の試掘調査は竪穴建物跡が13棟、竪穴掘立柱併用建物1棟、掘立柱建物3棟、水田跡などが残されており集落がそのまま残っている可能性がある。

御伽草子
14世紀後半ごろに成立した軍記物語『太平記』巻32「直冬上洛事付鬼丸事鬼切事」では鬼切安綱の伝来について、伯耆国の鍛冶・安綱が鍛えて征夷大将軍・田村麻呂に奉納し、田村麻呂は鈴鹿山で鈴鹿御前との剣合わせに使用したが、伊勢神宮に参拝した際に天照大神より夢の中で所望するお告を受けたため奉納したとある。この『太平記』での記述は、のちに酒呑童子の説話を書いた絵巻や絵詞などの諸本にも源頼光が酒呑童子を斬った太刀（童子切安綱）の伝来として引用されたように、御伽草子『鈴鹿の草子（田村の草子）』でも田村丸俊宗と鈴鹿御前が剣合わせをする場面にも影響を与えた。しかし『太平記』の時点では鈴鹿御前が持つとされる剣の名前までは登場していない。
室町時代中期から後期にかけて能『田村』を元にした御伽草子『鈴鹿の草子（田村の草子）』などが成立した。『太平記』での剣合わせの場面が引用され、鈴鹿御前の持つとされる剣の名前が田村語りに登場したと考えられるのはこのころとなる。『鈴鹿の草子（田村の草子）』の諸本は、鈴鹿御前と田村丸俊宗が戦いを経て婚姻し共に鬼退治をする「鈴鹿系」という古写本の系統と、田村丸俊宗の元に天女の鈴鹿御前が天下って婚姻し共に鬼退治をする「田村系」という流布本の系統に分類される。鈴鹿系と田村系では三明の剣を所有する者の来歴が一部異なる。

鈴鹿系（古写本系）
古写本の系統に分類される『鈴鹿の草子』や『田村の草子』では、伊勢国鈴鹿山に現れた天の魔焰・立烏帽子（鈴鹿の御前）を討伐するよう宣旨が下った田村丸俊宗将軍は、立烏帽子と剣合わせするも決着がつかず、逆に立烏帽子から自分は女であるがけんみやうれん、大とうれん、小とうれんの3本の剣があるので討たれることはないと言われた。
鈴鹿の御前が25歳で亡くなることを告げる場面では、大とうれんと小とうれんが田村丸俊宗に、けんみやうれんが小りんに渡った。鈴鹿の御前が飛行自在なのはけんみやうれんを朝日にかざせば三千大千世界を眼の前に見れるからだという。
鈴鹿の御前が亡くなったことを嘆いた田村丸俊宗も亡くなるが、鈴鹿の御前を返せと文殊の智剣（大とうれん、小とうれん）で獄卒を相手に狼藉を働いたため、倶生神や閻魔王は非業の死であった田村丸俊宗を生き返らせ、不死の薬を与えた。

田村系（流布本系）
流布本の系統に分類される『田村の草子』では、稲瀬五郎坂上俊宗（田村丸俊宗）が鈴鹿山の大嶽丸を鏑矢で射ようとするが天女・鈴鹿御前が制し、この鬼は阿修羅から贈られた大とうれん・小とうれん・けんみょうれんの三本の剣をもっているので無理だという。三本のうち一本は大嶽丸が天竺に持っていって無かったが、二本の剣を鈴鹿御前が色香で騙してとりあげ、大嶽丸を討伐した。しかし大嶽丸が黄泉還って陸奥国霧山に現れたが、俊宗はけんみょう連を取り上げて大嶽丸を討伐し、首を宇治の宝蔵に納めた。
鬼神を討ち果たしたのち天命を悟った鈴鹿御前は、大とうれん・小とうれんを俊宗に贈り、けんみょうれんを娘の小りんに遺したとある。

奥浄瑠璃版
奥浄瑠璃『田村三代記』では、立烏帽子討伐に向かった田村丸利仁将軍が先祖代々伝わるそはや丸を投げると立烏帽子は大通連を投げ返した。大通連とそはや丸は中空で渡り合い、そはや丸が鳥となると大通連は鷹となって追い出した。そはや丸が火焔となって吹きかかると大通連は水となってそれを消した。
大通連と小通連は文殊師理菩薩に打たせた通力自在の名剣とされ、顕明連は近江の水海の蛇の尾より取りし剣で別名を双無き剣とも水海剣ともいう。朝日に向かって虚空を三度振れば三千大千世界を目の前に見て通すことが出来るという。立烏帽子が亡くなるときに大通連と小通連は内裏に納めて内侍所の神事宝剣として日本の宝とすること、剣明剣は娘の正林に贈ることを遺言した。
『田村三代記』の末尾には屋代本『平家物語』や『源平盛衰記』の「剱の巻」に相当する部分が挿入される。古態を残す渡辺本『田村三代記』の「つるぎ譚」によると、立烏帽子（鈴鹿御前）の形見として田村に託された大通連・小通連が田村丸に暇乞いをして天に登り、3つの黒金となったものを箱根の小鍛冶に打たせたものがあざ丸・しし丸・友切丸の3つの剣であり、そはやの剱は毘沙門堂に納め置いた。古年刀である友切丸は八幡殿に申し下ろして源氏の宝となる。

概要
泉南市の長慶寺に伝えられており、蛇王姫は寺を守護してくれる存在として、寺の近くにあった池にまつられて来た。阿形賢一『泉州むかし話』では、文政年間（1818年～1831年）ごろのことであると語られている。
蛇王姫は、多数のヘビをしたがえた雌の大蛇で、長く池の中で暮らしていた。あるとき、近くにある和泉国（現・大阪府）長慶寺の住職となった鐘山和尚の美しさに恋焦がれてしまい、道に迷った旅の女の姿に化けて寺を訪ね、鐘山をたらしこもうとした。しかし、その挙動をあやしんだ鐘山によって刀で斬られ、虫の息の蛇王姫は長慶寺を守護しつづけることを誓って死んだ。
蛇王姫の池は埋め立てられており、現存していない。

蛇王
蛇王・蛇王姫という名称は、日本各地の寺社における蛇王（蛇王権現）に関する信仰に見られたと見られる。蛇王の最高位の存在が蛇王姫であるとも言われていたとされるが、長慶寺の蛇王姫の名称が何に由来しているのかについての記述は見られない。
岐阜県大垣市の明星輪寺を守護している存在として祀られている蛇王権現の伝説には、各国修行をしていた虚空蔵さまに恋焦がれた伊勢国（三重県）の娘が大蛇と化したという内容が見られる。大垣の赤坂山まで虚空蔵さまを追いつづけたその大蛇を、寺の鎮守として祀ったのが明星輪寺の蛇王権現だと語られる。

内容
昔、現在の愛知県春日井市松河戸町にあたる地域では、毎年のように庄内川が氾濫していた。明応3年（1494年）、村人がそのことで氏神の境内で話していると、陰陽師が通りかかったので相談した。陰陽師は「水神様に15歳の娘を捧げれば、水神様の怒りはおさまる」と告げ、15歳の娘をもつ親たちがくじ引きを行った。その結果、庄屋矢野家の娘が人柱に決定し、親子は泣く泣く受け入れる。6月29日、悲嘆のうちに白木の箱に入れられた娘は、頻繁に堤防が決壊する場所に埋められた。娘はそれから1週間棺の中で生き、一緒に入れた鐘を叩く音が地中から聞こえたという。それから水害がなくなり、村は平和となった。当時、埋められた場所に雑木林があったため、そこが「十五の森」と呼ばれるようになった。

備考
村人は娘を弔うため、小祠を建て、薬師如来を安置した。薬師如来は江戸時代の中頃に観音寺 (春日井市松河戸町)に移され、毎年命日の6月29日には供養が行われていたが、現在は、11月8日に供養が行われている。
親子地蔵が1969年（昭和44年）5月に建立され、そのかたわらには「十五の森の由来記」が石に刻まれている。
親子地蔵建立時1969年（昭和44年）5月5日、観音寺に於いて琵琶歌奉納がなされた。
当時の十五の森は、現在、松河戸町にある愛知電機の駐車場にあたる。駐車場脇には「十五之森趾」と書かれた標柱が立っている。

概略
表面には南北アメリカ大陸やユーラシア大陸などがレリーフのように描かれている。また、1800年代に発見された南極大陸に相当する大陸や、ムー大陸に相当する大陸が描かれている。西暦606年に聖徳太子によって建立されたと伝わる斑鳩寺には、聖徳太子ゆかりとされる宝物が所蔵されており、江戸時代に目録『常什物帳』（『斑鳩寺常什物帳』）が作成された。その中の「地中石」と記載されているのがこの地球儀であるといわれ、少なくともその頃から存在していたと考えられている。

科学的な分析
2003年3月に放映された日本テレビの『特命リサーチ200X』で、材質などの科学的な分析が行われた。分析結果により材質は石灰や海藻糊であることがわかった。建材としてよく知られている漆喰の技法で造られた可能性が高い。地球儀の表面には「墨瓦臘泥加（メガラニカ）」という文字が書かれていることも判明した。

想像上の大陸「メガラニカ」（Magallanica）
「墨瓦臘泥加（メガラニカ）」とは、南半球に存在すると考えられていた想像上の大陸である。
南半球に巨大な大陸があるという説は、古くは2世紀古代ギリシアのプトレマイオスの地図に見られる。大航海時代にマゼランが、マゼラン海峡を発見した際に、現在のティエラ・デル・フェゴ島を幻の南方大陸の一部として報告したことから、メガラニカ大陸の名称が広まった。メガラニカとはマゼランのスペイン名にちなんで付けられた名称である。一般的には“未知の南方大陸”として知られている（伝説上の大陸）。

世界地図の伝来
日本における世界地図の歴史は、中国で刊行された『坤輿万国全図』（1602年）から始まる。イエズス会の宣教師マテオ・リッチにより伝えられたが、この地図には既に南半球に広がる広大な大陸「メガラニカ」が描かれていた。

地球儀の作製年代
メガラニカの名称が書かれていることから、聖徳太子（574年 - 622年）の時代ではなく、江戸時代に作製された可能性が高い。『特命リサーチ200X』では、日本で最初の百科事典『和漢三才図会』（1712年）の編纂者、寺島良安が製作したという仮説を紹介している。『和漢三才図会』に掲載されている「山海輿地全図」と聖徳太子の地球儀の地形がほぼ一致するという理由などからである。

謎のムー大陸
この地球儀には「山海輿地全図」には存在しない大陸がムー大陸に相当する位置に描かれている。ムー大陸の初出は、ジェームズ・チャーチワード の『失われたムー大陸』（1931年）で、『和漢三才図会』所載「山海輿地全図」より200年ほど後のことである。
原田実は、加工の都合で場所と大きさを変えられたフィリピン・インドネシア・ミクロネシアの島々である、としている。

概要
御伽草子
『田村の草子』では、鈴鹿御前と夫婦となった田村丸俊宗が鈴鹿山の大嶽丸を討伐し、御門から給った伊賀国で暮らすうちに1人の姫君が産まれ、聖林（しやうりん）と命名された。
『鈴鹿の草子』では、鈴鹿御前が亡くなる際に姫君（小りん）は我に劣らぬ神通の者であると顕明連を賜る。

奥浄瑠璃
『田村三代記』でも御伽草子のあらすじと近い形で誕生するが、物語の末尾で小林姫は93歳まで大往生すると、奥州南部岩手郡へと飛んで、小林寺の地蔵菩薩として化現し、末世まで人々を救ったと締め括られる。

伝承地
松林寺
『田村三代記』で地蔵菩薩として化現した小林寺は、南部稗貫郡（現在の岩手県花巻市石鳥谷町）にある松林寺地蔵堂（子安地蔵）で、田村語りに登場する人物名（小林姫）に取り入れられた。また『田村三代記』が演じられた北限は松林寺のある稗貫郡周辺ではないかと考えられる。

遠野三山
岩手県遠野では坂上田村麻呂が東征の時、奥州に国津神の後胤という女神・玉山立烏帽子姫がおり、その美貌から夷の酋長大岳丸に言い寄られるも応じることはなかった。田村麻呂は勅使を奉じて東北の地に下だり、この立烏帽子姫の案内によって蝦夷を討伐し、頭領である大岳丸を岩手山で討ち取った。立烏帽子姫は田村麻呂と夫婦の契りを結び田村義道と松林姫の一男一女を産んだ。義道は奥州安倍氏の祖であり、松林姫はお石、お六、お初の三女を産んだ。お石は守護神である速佐須良姫の御霊代を奉じ石上山に登った。お六は速秋津比売の御霊代を奉じ六角牛に登った。お初は瀬織津比咩を奉じ早池峯に登ったという。

日本古来の風習あるいは伝承によれば、生贄を求める神は求める対象とする少女の家の屋根に、白羽の矢を目印として立てたという。このことから転じて、「白羽の矢が立つ」の形式で「多くのものの中から犠牲者として選び出される」という意味として使われる。

由来
柳田国男は、屋根に白羽の矢が立つという伝承を、祭りの開始を意味する柴指などの儀式で榊や柴を指すこと、および、祭りの場所を神意で決めたことに由来するという。
「白羽の矢」となった経緯として、「矢立の松」などのように矢を射立てることが結界の成立とみなされる考え方、あるいは、『平家物語』第一巻「願立」の仲胤法印が祈祷を行った後に八王子大権現の社から鏑矢の飛んでいく音がしたという話のように、神の意思が聖なる矢として現れるという考え方が影響しているとされる。白という色に関しては、聖なる性質を持つとされている。
また、神が赤く塗った矢に変化して女性のもとに通い女性がその神の子供を産むという「丹塗矢伝承」も、直接的ではないものの「白羽の矢」と関連していると考えられる。日本史学者武光誠の著書には、「丹塗矢伝承」を元にした能曲『賀茂』が「白羽の矢が立つ」の用法の由来となったとの説が見られる。

「白羽の矢が立つ」の用法
元来、「白羽の矢が立つ」という言葉は「犠牲として選ばれる」というイメージを持った言葉であった。現代においては、「特別に選び出される」「代表候補に選ばれる」というよい意味でも使用される。
また、「白羽の矢が立つ」が元々の用法であり、「白羽の矢が当たる」は誤用となる。しかし、2005年に文化庁が行なった世論調査によると、「白羽の矢が当たった」という言い回しを気にしない者も35.3%いるという結果が報告されている。

日本各地の白羽の矢にまつわる伝承
早太郎伝承
早太郎伝承は「猿神退治」とも呼ばれる伝承で、日本全国に類話が存在する。これらの類話において、「白羽の矢」が生贄のしるしとして使われる。
これらの類話のあらすじは以下のようになる。
旅人がどこかの村を訪ねると、白羽の矢が立った家の娘を土地の神に生贄にささげなければならないということを聞かされる。不審に思った旅人がこっそり様子を見ていると、化け物が現れて娘を連れて行くのを目撃し、その際に「早太郎に聞かせるな」と話しているのを耳にする。旅人は早太郎を探し回り、光前寺の犬であることを突き止めて、光前寺から犬を借りていく。生贄の娘の代わりに早太郎を送り出すと、翌朝、大猿が死んでいるのが見つかる。
登場する犬の名前は地方によって異なっており、長野県の光前寺では「早太郎」であるが静岡県磐田市では「しっぺい太郎」となっている。鹿児島にも同様の話が伝わっており、「さつま熊太郎」と呼ばれるという。石川県七尾市では狼の「しゅけん」とされる。
これらの伝承は地名を借りながら、各地に伝わっていったものと考えられる。小松和彦は、これらの伝承を「犬猿の仲である犬が猿を殺す話」とみなすとともに、猿を日吉山王社・日吉大社の使いと見立て、比叡山で延暦寺に支配下におかれた日吉山王社という構図から、猿を「征服された土地神」をあらわすのではないかと考察している。

丹塗矢伝承
神が赤く塗った矢に化身して、自らが選んだ女性と交わって子供を生ませるという丹塗矢伝承は、『古事記』などにも見られるが、それらの類型伝承のひとつとして、『山城国風土記』には、賀茂別雷神社に祭られる賀茂別雷命が、丹塗矢と化した乙訓神社の神火雷神と、賀茂建角身命の娘である玉依姫との間に生まれたとの話が紹介されている。
この『山城国風土記』の伝承を基にした能楽作品『賀茂』では、賀茂川を流れてきた白羽の矢が水汲みの下で止まり、不思議に思った少女が矢を持ち帰って軒下にさしておくと、やがて少女は懐妊して男の子を産んだという話が語られる。
『賀茂』では、ご神体として「白羽の矢」が使われている。武光誠は、『賀茂』が白羽の矢の話を広めたと見ている。

富岡八幡宮伝承
富岡八幡宮の社伝によれば、菅原道真の子孫である長盛法印が寝ているときに八幡大菩薩が現れ、「武蔵国永代島に白羽の矢が立っている、その白羽の矢が立っている場所が、私が鎮座すべき場所である。」というお告げを受けたとされる。実際に行って見ると白羽の矢が立っており、1627（寛永4）年にそこに富岡八幡宮を建てて八幡大菩薩を祭ったという。
富岡八幡宮の授与品である「白羽の矢」は「開運吉事の当り矢」とされ、開運、縁起がよいことの象徴とされる。

生涯
道真は是善とその夫人・伴氏の3男として生まれ、幼名が「阿呼」（あこ）とされる。幼少期について信用できる史料はほとんどない。兄二人の記録はなく、道真も兄弟はいないとしていることから夭折したものと考えられてきたが、詩中に一人子の表現があり一人子説が支持されている。
道真は幼少より詩歌に才を見せ、11歳で初めて漢詩を詠んだ。『菅家御伝記』によれば、道真の師は文章生田口達音であったとされる。貞観4年（862年）18歳で文章生となる。貞観9年（867年）には文章生のうち2名が選ばれる文章得業生となり、正六位下・下野権少掾に叙任される。貞観12年（870年）、官吏登用試験『対策』の方略策に「中上」の成績で合格し、位階を進め、正六位上となった。玄蕃助・少内記を経て、貞観16年（874年）従五位下に叙爵し、兵部少輔ついで民部少輔に任ぜられた。当時の朝廷の第一人者藤原基経も道真の文才を評価した一人であり、父・菅原是善を差し置いて、度々代筆を道真に依頼している。元慶元年（877年）式部少輔次いで世職である文章博士を兼任する。元慶3年（879年）従五位上。元慶4年（880年）の父・是善の没後は、祖父・菅原清公以来の私塾である菅家廊下を主宰、朝廷における文人社会の中心的な存在となった。
仁和2年（886年）讃岐守（讃岐国司）を拝任、式部少輔兼文章博士を辞し、任国へ下向することとなった。道真はこの任が「左遷である」と言われていることが残念であると述べており、度々悲しみの意を表している。送別の宴で、道真は摂政藤原基経から詩をともに唱和するよう求められたが、落涙・嗚咽して一言しか発せなかったという。仁和3年末には一時帰京し、翌仁和4年（888年）正月には任地に戻った。この年の4月、阿衡事件が発生し、基経が職務を妨害する事態となった。道真は10月頃再び入京し、基経に事件の発端となった橘広相を罰しないように意見書（奉昭宣公書）を寄せて諌めたとされる。この書が出されたとされる11月にはすでに橘広相は赦免されており、基経の態度に影響を与えるものではなかったが、儒者による橘広相への非難を緩和する効果があった可能性も指摘されている。

宇多天皇の近臣
寛平2年（890年）任地より帰京した。道真は本来ならば任地で行う引き継ぎを行わず京都に戻っている。この年、阿衡事件の後も厚い信任を受けていた橘広相が病没し、宇多天皇は代わる側近として道真を抜擢した。寛平3年（891年）2月29日、道真は蔵人頭に補任された。蔵人頭は天皇近臣中の近臣ともいえる職であり、紀伝道の家系で蔵人頭となったのは、道真以前は橘広相のみであった。道真は蔵人頭を辞任したいと願い出ているが、許されなかった。さらに3月9日には式部少輔、4月11日に左中弁を兼務。翌寛平4年（892年）従四位下に叙せられ、12月5日には左京大夫となっている。寛平5年（893年）2月16日には参議兼式部大輔に任ぜられて公卿に列し、2月22日には左大弁を兼務した。4月2日には敦仁親王が皇太子となったが、宇多天皇が相談した相手は道真一人であったという。立太子に伴い、道真は春宮亮を兼ねている。
寛平6年（894年）遣唐大使に任ぜられるが、道真は唐の混乱を踏まえて遣使の再検討を求める建議を提出している。ただし、この建議は結局検討されず、道真は遣唐大使の職にありつづけた。しかし内外の情勢により、遣使が行われることはなかった。延喜7年（907年）に唐が滅亡したため、遣唐使の歴史はここで幕を下ろすこととなった。寛平7年（895年）参議在任2年半にして、先任者3名（藤原国経・藤原有実・源直）を越えて従三位・権中納言、権春宮大夫に叙任。また寛平8年（896年）長女衍子を宇多天皇の女御とし、寛平10年（898年）には三女寧子を宇多天皇の皇子・斉世親王の妃とし、宇多との結びつきがより強化されることとなった。

右大臣
宇多朝末にかけて、左大臣の源融や藤原良世、宇多天皇の元で太政官を統率する右大臣の源能有ら大官が相次いで没し、寛平9年（897年）6月に藤原時平が大納言兼左近衛大将、道真は権大納言兼右近衛大将に任ぜられ、この両名が太政官の長となる体制となる。7月に入ると宇多天皇は敦仁親王（醍醐天皇）に譲位したが、道真を引き続き重用するよう強く醍醐天皇に求め、藤原時平と道真にのみ官奏執奏の特権を許した。
醍醐天皇の治世でも宇多上皇の御幸や宴席に従うなど、宇多の側近としての立場も保ち続けた。
昌泰2年（899年）右大臣に昇進して、時平と道真が左右大臣として肩を並べた。道真は家が儒家であり家格が低いことと、出世につけて中傷が増えたため辞退したいと上申していたが、悉く却下された。翌昌泰3年（900年）には右近衛大将の辞意を示したが、これも却下された。一方で文章博士・三善清行が道真に止足を知り引退して生を楽しむよう諭す文章を送っている。8月21日には祖父以来の文章・詩をまとめた家集を醍醐天皇に献上し、「尽く金」と激賞された。

左遷と死
昌泰4年（901年）正月に従二位に叙せられたが、天皇を廃立して娘婿の斉世親王を皇位に就けようと謀ったとして、1月25日に大宰員外帥に左遷された。宇多上皇はこれを聞き醍醐天皇に面会しとりなそうとしたが、衛士に阻まれて参内できず、また道真の弟子であった蔵人頭藤原菅根が取り次がなかったため、宇多の参内を天皇は知らなかった。また、長男の高視を始め、子供4人が流刑に処された（昌泰の変）。道真の後裔である菅原陳経が「時平の讒言」として以降、現在でもこの見解が一般的である。
道真と時平の関係は険悪、あるいは対立的であったと捉えられることが多いが、実際は道真の家と時平の家はそれぞれの父親の代から関わりが深く、度々詩や贈り物を交わす関係であった。ただし、贈答詩については、道真から発したものはなく時平への返答のみである。昌泰2年（899年）には、時平が父基経の事業を受け継いで建設した極楽寺（現在の宝塔寺の前身）を定額寺とするための願い状の代筆を道真に依頼するなど、時平は文章家としての道真を高く評価していた。道真の失脚は、単に時平の陰謀によるものではなく、道真に反感を持っていた多くの貴族層の同意があった。
また『扶桑略記』延喜元年七月一日条に引く『醍醐天皇日記』は、藤原清貫が左遷後の道真から聞いた言葉として、「自ら謀ることはなかった。ただ善朝臣（源善）の誘引を免れることができなかった。又仁和寺（宇多上皇）の御事に、数（しばしば）承和の故事（承和の変）を奉じるのだということが有った」と記載している。これにより、廃立計画自体は存在したという見解もある。ただし、藤原清貫の報告について『菅家後集』で清貫が道真と面会した形跡がないことから実際にあった出来事なのか疑問も指摘されている。また、廃立計画の背景として、時平の妹である穏子の入内を望む醍醐天皇に対して、阿衡事件の経緯から基経の娘（時平の姉妹）の入内を拒んできた宇多上皇が反発したとする指摘がある。
太宰府への移動はすべて自費によって支弁し、左遷後は俸給や従者も与えられず、政務にあたることも禁じられた。『菅家後集』に収められた「叙意一百韻」では、左遷・流謫の身に至るまでの自らの嘆きを綴っている。大宰府浄妙院で謹慎していたが、左遷から2年後の延喜3年（903年）2月25日に大宰府で薨去し、安楽寺に葬られた。享年59。刑死ではないが、衣食住もままならず窮死に追い込まれたわけであり、緩慢な死罪に等しい。

死後の復権
延喜6年（906年）冬、道真の嫡子高視は赦免され、大学頭に復帰している。延喜8年（908年）に藤原菅根が病死し、延喜9年（909年）には藤原時平が39歳で病死した。これらは後に道真の怨霊によるものだとされる。延喜13年（913年）には右大臣源光が狩りの最中に泥沼に沈んで溺死した。
延喜23年には醍醐天皇の皇子で東宮の保明親王が薨御した。『日本紀略』はこれを道真の恨みがなしたものだとしている。4月20日（923年5月13日）、道真は従二位大宰員外帥から右大臣に復され、正二位を贈られた。
延長8年（930年）朝議中の清涼殿が落雷を受け、大納言藤原清貫をはじめ朝廷要人に多くの死傷者が出た（清涼殿落雷事件）上に、それを目撃した醍醐天皇も体調を崩し、3ヶ月後に崩御した。これも道真の怨霊が原因とされ、天暦元年（947年）に北野天満宮において神として祀られるようになった。
一条天皇の時代には道真の神格化が更に進み、正暦4年（993年）6月28日には贈正一位左大臣、同年閏10月20日には太政大臣が贈られた。

家系
父は菅原是善、母は伴氏。菅原氏は、道真の曾祖父菅原古人のとき土師（はじ）氏より氏を改めたもの。祖父菅原清公と父はともに大学頭・文章博士に任ぜられ侍読も務めた学者の家系であり、当時は中流の貴族であった。母方の伴氏は、大伴旅人、大伴家持ら高名な歌人を輩出している。
正室は島田忠臣の娘、島田宣来子。忠臣は父も不明であるという家系の出身であったが、紀伝道においては道真の師であり、度々道真と詩や手紙を交わしあう関係であった。子は長男・高視や五男・淳茂をはじめ男女多数。子孫もまた学者の家として長く続いた。高視の曾孫が孝標で、その娘菅原孝標女（『更級日記』の作者）は道真の六世の孫に当たる。
特に高視の子孫は中央貴族として残り、高辻家・唐橋家をはじめ6家の堂上家（半家）を輩出した。明治時代になり5つの堂上家は華族に列し、当主はいずれも子爵に叙せられている。また高辻家からは西高辻家が別家し、太宰府天満宮の社家として現代に至る。

事績・作品
著書には自らの詩、散文を集めた『菅家文草』全12巻（昌泰3年、900年）、大宰府での作品を集めた『菅家後集』（延喜3年、903年頃）、編著に『類聚国史』がある。日本紀略に寛平5年（893年）、宇多天皇に『新撰万葉集』2巻を奉ったとあり、『寛平御時后宮歌合』や『是貞親王歌合歌』などの和歌とそれを漢詩に翻案したものを対にして編纂した『新撰万葉集』2巻の編者と一般にはみなされるが、原撰本（上下巻）を道真、増補本（下巻に補填を加えたもの）を源当時ではないかという指摘がある。
私歌集として『菅家御集』などがあるが、後世の偽作を多く含むとも指摘される。『古今和歌集』に2首が採録されるほか、「北野の御歌」として採られているものを含めると35首が勅撰和歌集に入集する。
六国史の一つ『日本三代実録』の編者でもあり、左遷直後の延喜元年（901年）8月に完成している。左遷された事もあり編纂者から名は外されている。
祖父の始めた家塾・菅家廊下を主宰し、人材を育成した。菅家廊下は門人を一門に限らず、その出身者が一時期朝廷に100人を数えたこともある。菅家廊下の名は清公が書斎に続く細殿を門人の居室としてあてたことに由来する。

人物
人柄
詩作にも官能的で優美な表現を取り入れており、宮廷詩では美人舞妓の踊り乱れた姿や、髪・肌・汗・香・化粧・衣などの様子を詩で仔細に鮮やかに表現している。ただし、常に浮かれていたわけではなく、特に盛り上がっている宴会のみで、普段の宴会では謹厳な態度を守り、自分の言行を抑える、というように二つの顔を使い分けていたという。
子煩悩で子供に関しての詩を多く残しており、菅家文草「夢阿満」では、“阿満”という一番可愛がっていた子が亡くなると、神仏を恨み世界から天地がなくなった、と嘆くほど悲しんでいる。しかし、最後に幼い阿満が三千世界に転生するときに迷わぬよう、観自在菩薩に祈っている。
根っからの詩人で、詩が思い浮かぶとすぐさまその場で口ずさみながら、周りの物に書き付けるほどだった。
自身の人生について、昔の栄達していたときは、世俗の煩わしさに縛られ窮屈だったが、今は罪を問われて左遷され、荒廃したあばら屋に閉じ込められた不自由な暮らし、と大宰府で述懐している。
どんな大量の黄金も、父祖から代々伝わった学識には遠く及ばない、としている。
「一国丸ごと買い取ってしまいたい」と評するほど、越州国の風景を気に入っていたという。
家族や気の置けない友人達との語らい、馬で自然を駆け巡ることなどを好んだが、大量の行政文書をかたづけるなど仕事に忙殺されることだけは嫌っていた。
梅の花を好んだことで有名だが、桜花の美しさを「弥勒菩薩が悟りをひらくという龍華樹も遠く及ばない」と称え、菊の花も若い頃から栽培するほど好み、薔薇の美しさを、妖艶で人を虜にして惑わす妖魔と例えている。
これに、雪と月を加えた「雪月花」を好んだとされ、雪は女性の化粧や老人の白髪の表現に、月は美しさはさることながら、正邪を照らしだす真澄鏡に例えたり、擬人化し「問秋月」「代月答」のように自己問答の形式で漢詩がつくられ、月光を誰も知らない自身の心の奥底にある清廉潔白さを照らし出す光として 題材にされた。

思想
『菅家文草』によると、道真は願文作成により、儒教的言説に基づいて、世界の差異（身分差別、男女差別など）を構造化し、仏教的基本原理（輪廻・化身・垂迹等々）とアナロジー（類推）を用いることで、隣接する概念間の差異を次々と消去し、「万物の均質化」と「存在の連鎖」を生み出した。
未だかつて邪は正に勝たず（邪まなことはどんなことがあっても、結局正義には勝てないのである）。
全ては運命の巡りあわせなのだから、不遇を嘆いて隠者のように閉じこもり、春の到来にも気づかぬような生き方はすべきではない。
紀長谷雄にたいし、世間では偉そうにべらべら喋る大学者さまが我が物顔で通るたびに有難がられているが、君が口を閉ざしても君の詩興が衰えることはないから心配するな、と励ましの詩をおくっている。
香は禅心よりして火を用ゐることなし 花は合掌に開けて春に因らず（香りは、わざわざ火を用いて焚くものではなく、清らかな心の中に薫るもの。同じように、花は春が来るからつぼみが開くのではなく、正しい心で合掌するその手の中に花は咲くもの）。
「閑思共有雕蟲業、應化使君昔詠詩」篆刻道が神仏に通ずることを示す。

交流
師であり義父である島田忠臣とは生涯に亘って交流があり、忠臣が死去した際に道真は「今後再びあのように詩人の実を備えた人物は現れまい」と嘆き悲しんだという。
紀長谷雄とは旧知の仲で、試験を受ける際に道真に勉学を師事したとされる。道真は死の直前に大宰府での詩をまとめた「菅家後集」を長谷雄に贈ったとされ、道真の妻を逃がしたという伝承もある。また、『扶桑略記』によれば、百人一首の舞台 として有名な宇多天皇御一行遊覧の際に長谷雄を求めて叫んだほど長谷雄への信頼があった、と同時に宇多天皇厚遇の時期であっても道真が孤独だったことがわかる。
在原業平とは親交が深く、当時遊女（あそびめ）らで賑わった京都大山崎を、たびたび訪れている。
天台宗の僧相応和尚とも親交があり、大宰府に向う際に淀川にて、自ら彫ったという小像と鏡一面を渡し、後のことを和尚に託したという。道真薨去後、和尚は小像・鏡を郷里の長浜市にある来生寺、その隣の北野社にそれぞれ祀ったという。
清廉剛直な武官の藤原滋実とも親交があった。滋実は、元慶の乱の鎮圧に参加し俘囚に配給して懐柔し、反乱した夷俘を討たせる役を命じられ見事成し遂げる。のちに陸奥国司となる。死因についてははっきりせず、部下に不正を行っていた輩が多く呪詛され殺されたのではないか、という噂がなされたため道真は五男菅原淳茂に調査を命じている。滋実が逝去したさい、誄歌「哭奥州藤使君」 をおくっている。かつて道真は滋実より「私は、あなたさまよりひそかに恩恵をうけています。私は、死のうが生きようが、生死を超えてあなたより受けたこのご恩に報いたいと思っております」と、熱い想いをつげられたという。それを回顧した道真は、自身の正義の是非について裁いてくれるよう、また、正義をつらぬくための手助けになってくれるよう、滋実の霊に懇願し悲嘆にくれている。ほかに、東国と中央政府の癒着した腐敗政治についても言及している。
『十訓抄』などには時平の弟、藤原忠平とは共に宇多天皇主催の歌会にでたり常に手紙を贈り合うなど、親交があり、道真の左遷にも反対したとされる。しかし坂本太郎は道真左遷時の忠平は従四位下にすぎず、時平に反対することなどできなかったと指摘している。これは北野天満宮の支援者であり、忠平の子孫である摂関家による付会ではないかと見られている。
渤海使で日本に帰化したとされる王文矩とも親交があったという。
道真は、菅家廊下の弟子の中で文室時実を一番可愛がっていた。時実は、若い頃から匏（能無しという意味）と言われる苦学生で、食べることもままならないほど貧しくそのうえ年老いた母親も抱えていた。道真が讃岐赴任のためいなくなったあとも、独り努力を重ね見事難関の省試に合格しその報告をしにきた彼にたいし、道真は称賛と若い文章生にいじめられないか心配する詩を綴っている。
13世天台座主法性坊尊意に教学を師事したとされる。
しかし、『菅家文草』「書斎記」によれば、友人でも親しい者とそうでない者がおり、そうでない者として、さして気が合うわけでもないのに愛想よく寄ってくる者、腹の底が判らない口先だけは変に親しい者、休息と称して無理矢理押し入ってくる者、秘蔵の書や書物を乱暴に扱う者、自分が苦労して書物から抜粋した短冊の知識を理解し勝手に持ち出してしまう者、理解できず破り捨ててしまう者、先客である大切な友人の面会を無視して特に用もないのに強引に面会にくる者をあげ、自分を本当に理解できる友人は3人ぐらいしかおらず、その3人も失ってしまうのではないかと戦々恐々としている。
また、学者や貴族などの恨み妬みが凄まじく、『菅家文草』「思ふ所有り」「詩情怨」では、巷で出回った怪文書の作者として濡れ衣を着せられ誹謗中傷されたこと、「博士難」では、道真が文章博士に就任するとき、父是善から味方がいなく孤独になることを助言されており、就任わずか三日目にして、まわりから誹謗中傷する噂がなされたことが書かれている。
絵に描いたものが飛び出して実体化するという逸話をもつ、宮廷絵師巨勢金岡とも親交があったとされる。
藤原南家出身の藤原菅根は、若い頃は菅家廊下で学んでいた。しかし、道真に投げやりな態度を難詰されたり、宴で歌った歌を全く認められないなどしたため逆恨みし、成人して官僚になっていくにつれ藤原時平率いる藤原北家へ接近していったとされる。
安倍興行、島田良臣、菅野惟肖、巨勢文雄等の学者たちとは、地方官時代に文通で遠く離れたお互いを励ましあうなど、詩友として交流があったという。ただし、巨勢文雄については、試験で文雄が称賛し推薦した弟子の三善清行を、試験官だった道真が嘲笑し落第させている。これが、清行との確執の発端とされている。
対策及第の試験官だった都良香が後年評価に不服だった道真の怨念に当たり亡くなったとする伝説がある。

讃岐
道真は詩臣として中央で天皇のそばにお仕えし詩を作ることこそ菅原家の祖業であるという強い信念を持っていた。その為、自分が地方官として讃岐に赴任することに葛藤していた。赴任後、詩人として周りとの感性の違いに戸惑い、また、道真は家族愛が人一倍強かったので家族のそばにいれない寂しさも綴っている。
しかし、元来の生真面目で清廉な性格から、白居易の兼済（広く人民を救済）という志を信条とし、自ら酒を醸して酒宴を催し村人と親交を深めたり、『寒早十首』『冬夜九詠』などで民の悲惨な実情を見分するなど、善政を執り行うよう努めた。
のちに、清廉と謹慎を心がけた政治をしたが、不正腐敗に汚染された青蝿のような官吏たちを一掃できなかったことを悔いている。

左遷
『政事要略』巻二十二によれば、大宰府へ左遷の道中には、監視として左衛門少尉善友と朝臣益友、左右の兵衛の兵各一名がつけられた。また、官符に道真は“藤原吉野の例に倣い「員外帥」待遇にせよ”と明記され、道中の諸国では馬や食が給付されず、官吏の赴任としての待遇は与えられなかった。
『菅家後集』「叙意一百韻」には、左遷道中の様子として反道真派の奸計により絶えず危険にみまわれ、落し穴などの罠や誅伐として行く手に潜伏していた刺客に襲われたこと、傷ついた駄馬や損壊した船を与えられたことなど、執拗な嫌がらせをうけていたことが綴られている。

大宰府
讃岐時代と同様に北九州の庶民の暮らしぶりについても詩を綴っている。延喜元年（901年）十月頃の作『菅家後集』「叙意一百韻」で、人を騙して銭をまきあげる布商人、何の苦もなく簡単に殺人を犯す悪党、のどかな顔をして肩を並べている群盗、汚職で私腹を肥やす役人などが慣習として蔓延っており「粛清することはもはや不可能」と評する程の治安の悪さを綴っている。
また、自分のみじめな姿を見に来る野次馬への苦痛、自分の心が狂想におちいってること、仏に合掌して帰依し座禅を組んでいること、言論封殺のため自由に詩を作ることを禁じられたこと、自身の体が痩せこけ白髪が増えていってることや、着物が色あせていくこと、政敵の時平一派にたいする憤り、かつて天皇へ忠誠を誓ったことへの後悔、捏造された罪状が家族・親戚まで累が及ぶことと、過去の功績の抹殺にたいしての痛恨と悲憤を綴っている。
『菅家後集』「讀家書」では、久しぶりに妻から手紙がきたことを書いている。道真は、妻が薬（生姜と昆布）を送るなど自分を労わる気持ちは嬉しいが、家族の生活が苦しいことをひた隠しにしていることが、かえって自分を悲しめ心配させているのだと綴っている。
また、「詠樂天北窓三友詩」によれば、詩友として≪死≫という真の友だけが残ったとし、謫居の北の窓の部屋に時たま現れる雀と燕の親子を良友とし、彼ら雌雄が相互支えあい雛を養育し飢えさせることのない慈しみある行動は、家族を離散させてしまった私では遠く及ばないとし、その口惜しさを言葉にすることもできず、血の涙を流しながらただ天神地祇に祈るのみ。そして、昔の友は喜び今の友は悲しみとし、それぞれ異なる友だが、それはそれで同一のものなのかもしれない、と結ぶ。

伝説
出生
喜光寺（奈良市）の寺伝によれば、道真は現在の奈良市菅原町周辺で生まれたとされる。ほかにも菅大臣神社（京都市下京区）説、菅原院天満宮神社（京都市上京区）説、吉祥院天満宮（京都市南区）説、菅生天満宮（堺市美原区）説、菅生寺（奈良県吉野郡吉野町）、菅原天満宮（島根県松江市）説もあるため、本当のところは定かではないとされている。また、余呉湖（滋賀県長浜市）の羽衣伝説では「天女と地元の桐畑太夫の間に生まれた子が菅原道真であり、近くの菅山寺で勉学に励んだ」と伝わる。
道真の生誕地については諸説ある。各地に伝わる『天神縁起』によれば、承和12年（845年）春頃、十一面観音菩薩を安置する高松山天門寺にある菅生池の菅の中より忽然と容顔美麗（振り分け髪をした薄桃色の着物を着る少女の姿）なる5・6歳の幼児が化現し、光を放ちながら飛び去り、是善邸南庭に現れ「私には父母がいないのでそなたを父にしたい」と語った子供が、道真だという。
長男次男を幼くして相次いで亡くした是善は、臣下の島田忠臣に命じ伊勢神宮外宮神官の度会春彦を通じて豊受大御神に祈願して貰った。そうして生まれたのが道真だという。その縁で、春彦は白太夫 として道真の守役となり生涯にわたり仕える事になったという。
菅原天満宮によれば是善が出雲にある先祖の野見宿禰の墓参りをした際、案内してくれた現地の娘をたいそう寵愛した。そして生まれたのが道真だという。
滋賀県余呉町には、道真が天女から産まれたという天女の羽衣伝説が残されている。あらすじは、あるとき、漁師の桐畑太夫のところへ美しい天女が舞い降りる。太夫は羽衣を隠し無理矢理その天女と夫婦になる。そして、玉のような男の子が産まれ陰陽丸と名づけられる。しかし、天女が羽衣を見つけ天に帰ってしまい、桐畑太夫もそのあとをおい天にのぼっていってしまう。男の子は石の上に捨て置かれ、母恋しさに法華経のような声で泣きじゃくる。そこに、菅山寺の僧・尊元阿闍梨が通りかかり憐れに思い引き取り養育することにした。その後、菅原是善が菅山寺に参拝にきたさいその子供を養子にする。この子供こそのちの菅原道真だという。
また、別説では、桐畑太夫と天女のあいだに産まれた陰陽丸、菊石姫の兄妹としている。
江戸時代に書かれた『古朽木』によれば、道真は梅の種より生まれたという。
『野馬台詩（歌行詩）』の主釈によれば、菅原道真と吉備真備は兄弟で、兄が道真、弟が真備だという。
道真は丑年丑の日丑の刻生まれだったという伝承がある。

人物像
梅ヶ枝餅とカレイと醤油ご飯が好物だったという伝承がある。他に、柿を庶民に普及したという言い伝えも残っている。
茶に関する故実を調査・研究し、世間に喫茶の習慣を広めたため、茶聖菅公と称されたという。
乗馬を好み、通勤は馬でおこない、讃岐での遠出や右近の馬場での桜狩りなど、趣味でも馬を走らせていたという。のちに、天神乗りという騎乗法が伝わり、馬術の師として祀られることになる。
政治の合間に和歌を吟詠しては、その草稿を「瑠璃壺」に納めていた。左遷の時、その壺を携えて筑紫に下り、見るもの聞くものにつけて感じるままに和歌を詠み、百首を新たに壺に納め、道真が逝去後、壺は白太夫の手に渡ったという。別の伝承では、道真が大宰府へ赴いたとき、宇佐のほとりで龍女が現れ、「瑠璃壺」を承ったという。
学問だけでなく、武芸（弓道）にも優れ、若い頃は都良香邸で矢を射れば百発百中だったという伝承がある。また、大蛇に苦しめられたため自ら矢で射て退治したという逸話もある。

刀工として古代の名工の一人に数えられている。
子はおよそ23人、またはそれ以上に上るとされ、長男高視が産まれる以前の、文章得業生の頃には既に子があったという。
「和魂漢才」という言葉を生み出したとされる。日本固有の精神「大和魂」と、中国伝来の学問「漢才」という対なる概念のことで、また、その両者を合わせるといった思想。のちに和魂洋才という言葉が派生した。ただし、この言葉が出てくる『菅家遺誡』は、鎌倉時代から室町時代に成立したと見られており 後世に平田篤胤によって加筆改竄された偽書ではないか、という指摘がなされている。
心だに 誠の道にかなひなば 祈らずとても 神や守らん（人は、心さえ誠の道にそっていれば、あらためて祈りを捧げなくても、神がきっと守ってくれるだろう。）
勝楽寺延命院には、讃岐国が栄えるよう道真が「一」の字を奉納したという言い伝えがある。「一」には物事のはじめ、又は全体を知るという意味があり、古来よりこの「一」と縁を結べば諸願成就すると言われている。
菅原家は代々焼物、神聖文字、占呪法（気・密教・呪術等の秘法）、土木事業、行事、儀式、法律等を祖業とし道真もこれを受け継いでいる。また、仙人、道士を研究し秘法の実践に余念がなかった。
伊勢神宮には神代文字で書かれた道真の奉納文が残されている。また、道真を遠祖とする副島家には道真のものとする御神印が伝わっている。直系子孫の塩小路家には、祖父清公が始め道真が完成させた神と対話する為の神聖文字として菅家塩小路篆刻道が現代まで継承されている。

出来事
元慶8年（884年）、道真が40歳の頃に叔母である覚寿尼のいる道明寺に4～7月まで滞在した。その時、夏水井の水を汲み青白磁円硯で、五部の大乗経の書写をしていた。すると、二人の天童が現れ、浄水を汲んで注ぎ写経の業を守護し、白山権現、稲荷明神が現れ、筆の水を運び、天照大神、八幡神、春日大明神が現れ、大乗経を埋納する地を示したという。そこに埋納すると「もくげんじゅ」という不思議な木が生えてきたという。
同年、畿内が大旱魃にみまわれたため、陽成天皇の勅命により道真が奉幣使として意賀美神社にて祈雨祈願したところ、たちどころに雨が降るという霊験があったという。

17歳で清水寺に参拝したさい、田口春音という捨子を拾い養育したという。春音は大宰府まで同行し、道真逝去後は出家し、道真の菩提を弔ったという。
久米仙人の修行の様子が龍門寺の扉に描かれ、道真の文と共にしばらくの間残ったとする文献がある。

讃岐
仁和4年（888年）讃岐の国で大旱魃が起こり、讃岐守に就いていた道真がこれを憂い、城山で身を清め七日七晩祭文を読上げたところ、見事雨に恵まれたという。
そのさい、道真が舞ったとされる踊りが西祖谷の神代踊として伝わっており、民衆が喜び踊り狂ったものが滝宮の念仏踊の起源とされている。
道真が讃岐守に就いていた頃、側に仕えていたお藤という女性と恋仲になり、愛妾にしたという。
極楽寺の明印法師という僧と親交を深めたとされ、極楽寺の由緒を話したり、道真から寄付をうけたり、詩文を贈答されたり、道真が一時帰京した際には、わざわざ京まで逢いにいったという。
おとぎ話『桃太郎』は、道真が讃岐守に就いていた時分に、当地に伝わる昔話をもとに作り上げ、それを各地に伝えた、という伝説が女木島に伝わっている。
また、『竹取物語』の竹取の翁の名が「讃岐造」であること、自身の神秘的な出生にまつわる伝承から道真が作者ではないかという説がある。

右大臣
寛平2年（890年）の頃、與喜山で仕事をしていた樵夫の小屋に、何者かが「これを祀れ」と木像を投げこんだという。樵夫はその頃、長谷寺に道真が参詣に来ていたので、「木像は道真公の御作ではないか」と思い、大切に祀ったという。その像が與喜天満神社に現存する木造神像として伝えられている。
寛平7年（895年）に法華経や金光明経を手写し伊香具神社へ納経したという。
また、道真自刻として伝わる志明院の眼力不動明王、清閑寺の十一面千手観音像、大報恩寺の千手観音立像、他に、住吉神社の神鏡、氣比神宮の為当太神御神幣有奉納鉾太刀など、さまざまなものを神社仏閣へ奉納している。
寛平8年（896年）2月10日、勅命により道真が長谷寺縁起文を執筆していたところ、夢に3体の蔵王権現が現れ、「この山は神仏の加護厚く功徳成就の地である」と、告げられたという。
昌泰元年（898年）10月17日、夢に祖父清公が現れ補陀落に行きたいと懇願されたので、道真は長谷寺で忌日法要したという。

醍醐天皇の時世に、道真が谷汲山華厳寺の岩屋に参籠し、毎日、お経を書いていると、白石山の淵に住む乙姫が毎朝早く、ご飯の炊事・洗濯に使用している「姫ヶ井の泉」の清水を「閼迦の水」として道真に与えていた伝承がある。乙姫の歌として「このころは汲みては知らん山の井の 浅さ深さを 人の心に」が残されているが、不思議なことに、道真以外にこの乙姫の姿を見られた者はいなかったという。
醍醐天皇の命により災いを起こす人魚を道真が小野の地で退治した伝承が、四角柱の人魚塚とともに残されている。

左遷
左遷の日、藤原時平、源光、藤原定国、藤原菅根らは、勅宣と称し陰陽寮の官人をあつめ、道真とその子孫が永く繁栄できぬよう絶えるよう、皇城の八方の山野に雑宝を埋めおき、神祭（陰陽道祭）を行うという大がかりな呪詛・厭術をさせた。しかし、道真はこれを絶つ術を知っていたため呪いを免れたが、子孫たちはなす術がなかったため、死後、神となった道真が守護し呪詛・厭術を防いでいるという。
左遷のおり道真は嫡子を哀れみ「日月は天地の父母なり、梅は寒苦を経て清香を発し、松は千年を経て尚、志節道義を失わず」と諭したという。
道真が都を出発する前日、都七条坊門の文（あや）という娘が、夢中で見送るようにとお告げをうけ、三条大橋の袂で綾竹を持ち別れの舞を舞い見送ったのが綾子舞の由来とされる。
大阪市東淀川区にある「淡路」「菅原」の地名は、道真が大宰府に左遷される際、当時淀川下流の中洲だったこの地を淡路島と勘違いして上陸したという伝説にちなんだ地名である。
出水市壮の菅原神社に関する伝承として、ジョウス(城須)という老夫婦が道真に三杯の茶を振舞い、そのため道真が追手から逃れることができたという。
道真が、失意の中で尼崎に立ち寄ると、悲しみで人だけでなく草木もしおれた。しかし、ネギだけがしゃんとしており、村人はそのネギを憎み、食べなくなったという言い伝えがある。
山陽道を通って太宰府へ向かう道中で、かつて讃岐に赴任する際に懇意になった明石駅の駅長・橘季祐（たちばなのゆえすけ）に再会したが、落魄した道真を見た駅長は道真にかける言葉もなかった。道真はこのときの思いを「駅長驚くなかれ 時の変改することを 一栄一楽 是れ春秋」の詩を与えて慰め返したという。この逸話は『大鏡』に載せられているものであるが、後年の『源氏物語』でも「駅長に口詩を与えた人もいた」と記されている。
901年道真が筑後川で暗殺されそうになった際、「三千坊」という河童の大将が彼を救おうとして手を斬り落とされ落命した、もしくは道真の馬を川へ引きずり込もうとした三千坊の手を道真が斬り落とした、という伝承が福岡県の北野天満宮に、河童の手の亡骸とともに残されている。
また、大宰府左遷のおり道真は兵主部という妖怪を助け、その返礼として「我々兵主部は道真の一族には害を与えない」という約束をかわした、という伝説も伝わっている。
道真は左遷の際、忠臣高田正期へ桜の木を与えた。この桜の花が咲かなかった年に道真に何かあったのでは、と正期は不安になり大宰府へ赴いたという。このことに感動した道真は、天拝山の土で自身の像をつくりそれを持ち帰らせた。正期は、独鈷抛山の麓に祠をつくりそれを祀った。正期の死後、桜は枯れてしまう。それから300年後、積善寺の住職の枕元に天神となった道真が夜毎に立ったので、独鈷抛山の麓の祠を寺の境内に移動した。すると桜の形をした石が桜の木が植わっていたまわりの石から浮かび上がってきたという。
道真が忌宮神社の大宮司家に立寄り泊まった際、庭にある井戸に自分の姿を映した。すると、ひどく淋しい気持ちになり、水にうつった自分の顔に向かい「都を離れてすでに百日以上になる、ずいぶんやつれた顔になったな、しかし、もう二度とこの土地にくることはなし、この井戸で私の顔をみることもあるまい」と筆と紙をとり出し、自画像を描いたという。その後、その井戸は「御影の井戸」と呼ばれ、この井戸をのぞいたものは、目がつぶれるという言い伝えが伝わっている。
岡山県にある天満宮（称:子安天満宮）には、道真が当地に宿泊したさい、海女が難産で苦しんでいるのを不憫に思い一首の歌を与えた。すると、たちまち海女は安産したという言い伝えがあり、その時に道真が座った石を腰懸石として瓦祠で祀っている。
道真の側室は臨月であったが、道真との別れを惜しみ後を追ったという。しかし、途中で産気を催したため、人家に立ち寄ろうとしたものの、間に合わず輿中で大量に出血しながら産んだという。その時、道が真赤に染まった為、「赤大路」の地名由来となった。その後、近くの民家で介抱したものの、産後の経過が悪く亡くなってしまう。夫人は死期に臨むさい、里人の介抱を深く感謝し死後は安産の神になると遺言されたので、子安天満宮が建立されたという。
他に、斎世親王の妃となっていた道真の息女が身重で信濃に落ち延びる途中で産気づき、街道の平石で臥せって苦しんでいた。その後、里人の手厚い看護もむなしく無念な最期となったが、その臨終の際、里人の厚い情けに報いるためにと女人の安産を平石に強く祈願したといわれている。
また、道真の息子福部童子は、父の後を追って大宰府へ向かったが、山口で病気になり亡くなったという。
娘の苅屋姫も父のあとを追いかけたが、あと少しの所で間に合わず、足摺り（＝蹉跎）して嘆いたという。のちに、大宰府でその話を聴いた道真は、三尺二寸の自身の木像を作って娘に送ったという。
道真の六女で愛娘のみよこ姫は、宮城県丸森町にある宗吽院に輿入れしたという。
道真の正室島田宣来子（または側室）が、岩手県一関市東山町に落ち延びたという落人伝説がある。
左遷の折、北九州市戸畑区天籟寺に立ち寄ったという伝説がある。立ち寄りにあたり、手足を洗ったとされる菅公御手洗の池が存在する。ただ住民は不審に思い早々に追い出してしまったとなっており、後に道真と知った住民は菅原神社を建立した。

太宰府
『寛永諸家系図伝』によれば、道真が筑紫にいたとき、兄“前田”と弟“原田”2人の息子を授かったという。
大宰府での生活は厳しいもので、「大宰員外帥」と呼ばれる名ばかりの役職に就けられ、大宰府の人員として数えられず、大宰府本庁にも入られず、給与はもちろん従者も与えられなかった。住居として宛がわれたのは、大宰府政庁南の、荒れ放題で放置されていた廃屋（榎社）で、侘しい暮らしを強いられていたという。また、時平の差し向けた刺客が道真を狙って謫居周辺を絶えず徘徊していたという。
謫居には、左遷時に別れをあまりにも悲しみ慕われたため仕方なく連れてきた姉紅姫、弟隈麿幼い2人の子供がいた。『菅家後集』「慰少男女詩」で親子で励ましあって一緒に生活していたことが綴られている。また、2人を連れて館のまわりを散歩していると、小さな池にたくさんの蛙がおり、親兄弟が揃ってにぎやかに鳴き声をあげていた。その声を聞いていた道真が、離れ離れになった家族のことなどを思い出して一首詠むと、歌を聞いた池の蛙たちは、不遇な道真たちの心を察したのかこののち鳴かなくなったという伝承がある。
しかし、902年秋頃に弟の隈麿が他界、数か月後に左遷時に病床にあった妻も他界し、その10日後に道真も他界した。残された紅姫は、亡き父から託された密書を四国にいる長兄菅原高視に届けるために密かに大宰府をたった。藤原氏の追手が迫る中、若杉山麓に身を潜め、山上の若杉太祖神社に守護を祈願したが、いつしか刺客にみつかり、篠栗の地で非業の最期を遂げたという。現在は、紅姫稲荷神社に紅姫天王という稲荷神として祀られている。
道真が大宰府に流されたとき道真を慕ってついてきた時遠という従者が鳥栖に隠れ住んでいた。鹸老いて子供のいない時遠を憐れみ道真は我が子長寿麿を養子にやったという。道真は時々長寿麿の元を訪ね、池に映った自分の肖像画を描き子にあたえたという。その池が元町に残る（鏡姿見の池）で、道真が腰掛けた石とともに伝わっている。
道真公が藤原氏の刺客から逃れるため板屋まで逃げてきたことがあった。数日後、太宰府へ発つさい、親切にしてくれた板屋の民家に同伴の子どもを預けた。これが、板屋の「真子」姓の始まりとされ、その子孫が奉納したという道真とその母と妻二組の像が北山神社のご神体となっている。
道真は太宰府に向かう途中、津和田村の「千早の杜」を訪ね、そこで「わがたよる千早の宮のます鏡くもらぬすがたうつしてぞゆく」「ふりかえりかへり行くかも別れにし、千早の杜の見ゆるかぎりは」と詠み、連れ子の好寛を隣村の中務家に預けたという。
梅ヶ枝餅は道真が大宰府へ員外師として左遷され悄然としていた時に、老婆が道真に餅を供しその餅が道真の好物になり、道真の死後老婆が梅の枝を添えて餅を墓前に供えた、或いは道真が左遷直後軟禁状態で食事もままならなかったおり、老婆が軟禁部屋の格子ごしに梅の枝の先に餅を刺して差し入れたという伝承が由来とされる。
左遷のおり、道真の母の霊が息子を心配し、京都伏見稲荷大社から稲荷神を遣わせ、大宰府の石穴神社に鎮まったとする伝承がある。稲荷神は、道真の配所に稲穂を届け飢えを救ったという。
あるとき、葦の生い茂る沼周辺で大鯰が顔を出して通行人の邪魔をしていた。道真は、これを太刀で頭、胴、尾と三つに斬り退治したという。その遺体がそれぞれ鯰石となり、後に雨を降らす雨乞いの石として地元の人々に大切にされたという。
延喜2年（902年）正月7日に道真自ら悪魔祓いの神事をしたところ、無数の蜂が参拝者を次々と襲う事件がおきた。そのとき鷽鳥が飛来して蜂を食いつくし、人々の危難を救ったのが鷽替え神事の由来とされる。また他にも、道真が賊に襲われたとき牛が身をていして守ってくれた伝説や、道真が難破に巻き込まれたとき昔飼っていた愛犬の霊が宿った犬石が助けてくれたという犬島伝説が伝わる。
道真がいろは歌の作者とする説がある。7段書きにした場合に下の部分が「咎なくて死す」となるため、『菅原伝授手習鑑』を契機に江戸時代中期頃広まったという。
晩年、道真は無実を天に訴えるため、身の潔白を祭文に書き、七日七夜天拝山山頂の岩の上で爪立って、祭文を読上げ天に祈り続けた。すると、祭文は空高く舞上り、帝釈天を過ぎ梵天まで達し、天から『天満大自在天神』と書かれた尊号がとどいたという。

飛梅伝説
道真が京の都を去る時に、庭に植えられた梅の木に「東風（こち）吹かば 匂ひをこせよ 梅の花 主なしとて 春な忘れそ」 という和歌を詠んだ。その梅が、京の都から太宰府の道真の住む屋敷の庭へ飛んできたという「飛梅伝説」が存在する。また、同様に松の木も京都から飛び立ったが、須磨（現在の神戸市須磨区板宿町板宿八幡神社）で力尽きて落ちたという「菅公の飛松」の伝説もある。

薨去の地に関する伝承
鹿児島県薩摩川内市東郷町藤川の菅原神社（別名：藤川天神）で菅原道真が死去したとされたとの伝承と共に、道真のものと伝わる墓がある。
身の危険が迫り、筑前から船で水俣湾を経て鹿児島県薩摩川内市湯田町に上陸し、薩摩川内市城上町吉川を経て、同市東郷町藤川の藤川神社で隠棲し薨去したとされる。その経路には、船繋石・御腰掛石などの史跡が残っている。また、吉川では菅原道真を奥座敷に納戸にかくまったことから、年中行事として村人が集まり女子は左右の袖を広げて男子を隠して奥座敷に潜ませる真似をする風習が残っている。
他に『放ちの鐘伝承』がある。迫る刺客に危険を感じた菅原道真は舟で南下する途中にお告げのあった湯田川河口奥の大きな石に舟を繋ぎ（菅公舟繋ぎ石）降りて鈴を鳴らすと潮が引き、持ち物共々船は河口から沖へと消え、身軽になった道真は幾山を越え東郷の地を辿り、藤川にて天神になったという。その後湯田川河口は、放し事を下げ潮時に念じれば叶う聖地となった。

怨霊伝説と北野信仰
道真が怨霊と見る向きが決定的となったのは、延喜23年（923年）に醍醐天皇の皇子保明親王が薨去し、これを受けて道真の復権が行われた頃だと見られている。さらに延長3年（925年）に保明親王の皇子慶頼王、承平3年には時平の長男保忠が没しており、これも道真の怨霊説を補強する形となった。
清涼殿落雷事件（930年）によって道真の怨霊は雷と結び付けられ、朝廷は火雷神が祀られていた京都北野寺の寺内社北野神社に道真を祀った。太宰府には先に醍醐天皇の勅命によって藤原仲平が建立した安楽寺の廟を安楽寺天満宮に改修して道真の祟りを鎮めようとした。また時平の弟藤原忠平の子藤原師輔は北野神社を支援し、天徳3年（959年）に祭文を捧げ、社殿を造営している。師輔は兄であり、時平の娘を妻としていた藤原実頼の家と競っており、道真の怨霊の強調は実頼の系統を圧迫する目的があったのではないかという説がある。正暦4年（994年）には疫病が流行し、これは道真の祟りとして正二位・左大臣が贈られている。一方で寛和2年（982年）には慶滋保胤が道真を学問の神として祀る祭文を挙げており、寛弘9年（1012年）には大江匡衡の祭文によって学問の神的側面が強調されている。また冤罪を晴らす神としての信仰もあり、『栄華物語』には太宰府に配流された藤原伊周が雪冤を願って太宰府天神を参詣する姿が描かれている。以降、北野信仰は中・下層階級から摂関家に至るまで広まった。
江戸時代には昌泰の変を題材にした芝居、『天神記』『菅原伝授手習鑑』『天満宮菜種御供』等が上演され、特に『菅原伝授手習鑑』は人形浄瑠璃・歌舞伎で上演されて大当たりとなり、義太夫狂言の三大名作のうちの一つとされる。現在でもこの作品の一部は人気演目として繰返し上演されている。
近代以降は忠臣としての面が強調され、紙幣に肖像が採用された。具体的には、戦前の日本銀行券の歴代の五円（五圓）紙幣のうち改造券・乙号券・丁号券・い号券・ろ号券、及び甲貳拾圓券に採用されている。配所にても天皇を恨まずひたすら謹慎の誠を尽くしたことは、広瀬武夫の漢詩「正気歌」に「或は菅公筑紫の月と為る」と詠まれ、また文部省唱歌にも歌われた（例えば尋常小学唱歌などに「菅公」と題する歌が収録されている）。第一高等学校では生徒訓育を目的に、倫理講堂正面に文人の代表として菅原道真の、武人の代表として坂上田村麻呂の肖像画が掲げられていた。昭和3年（1928年）に講談社が発行した雑誌「キング」に、「恩賜の御衣今此に在り捧持して日毎余香を拝す」のパロディ「坊主のうんこ今此に在り捧持して日毎余香を拝す」が掲載されたところ、不敬であるとの批判が起こり、講談社や伊香保温泉滞在中の講談社社長野間清治の元に暴漢らが押し寄せるという事件も発生している。
近年では、『社会科 中学生の歴史』（帝国書院）などの歴史の教科書に、『北野天神縁起絵巻』や道真の肖像画が載せられ、怨霊から神になるまでの経緯が紹介されている。

なお伝承上、この石に起源を持つと伝えられている石が全国にいくつかあり、それらの中に「殺生石」と呼ばれているものがあるほか、那須の殺生石同様に火山性ガスが噴出する場所で「殺生石」と呼ばれる石があるとする文献もある。しかし単に「殺生石」といえば那須の殺生石を指すことが多い。

概要
付近一帯は硫化水素、亜硫酸ガスなどの有毒な火山ガスが絶えず噴出しており、「鳥獣がこれに近づけばその命を奪う、殺生の石」として古くから知られた名勝であった。松尾芭蕉も訪れ、『おくのほそ道』にその様子が記され、「石の香や 夏草赤く 露暑し」と詠んだ。
現在一帯は「殺生石園地」と呼ばれ、観光客が多く訪れる名所となっている。ただしガスの噴出量が多い時は立ち入りが規制される。
2022年3月5日に殺生石が二つに割れていることが確認された。割れる数年前よりひびが確認されていたため、那須町は「自然に割れた可能性が高い」との見解を述べている。
2022年12月7日には、殺生石の近くでイノシシ8頭（成獣3頭、幼獣5頭）の死骸が見つかった。群れで行動中に、特に硫化水素や亜硫酸ガスの発生が多いとされる殺生石の右奥付近で横たわっていたという。死骸は翌日に環境省と那須町職員により回収され焼却処分された。これまでもタヌキやキツネの死骸は見つかっていたがイノシシは初であった。ガスの有毒性については、人間ならば近づかなければ問題はないが、幼児やペット連れは注意してほしいと以前から看板を設置して注意喚起している。

御神火祭
活火山である茶臼岳（那須岳）を鎮める祈りのため、例年5月に一般社団法人那須町観光協会の主催により御神火祭（ごじんかさい）が執り行われる。白装束に狐面やフェイスペイントを施した 100 名の松明行列が、那須温泉神社で「無間地獄の火」を採火し殺生石へ下り、神事の後に殺生石近くに設けられた高さ約 5 m の大松明「御神火」に点火する。殺生石前では白面金毛九尾狐太鼓の披露も行われる。
2022年の御神火祭では、いちご一会とちぎ国体の炬火の一部となる火が採火された。

伝説
九尾の狐伝説
鳥羽上皇が寵愛したという伝説の女性・玉藻前が九尾の狐の化身（妖狐）で、陰陽師の安倍泰成に見破られて東国に逃れ、上総介広常と三浦介義純が狐を追いつめ退治すると狐は石に姿を変えたという伝説がある。しかし石は毒を発して人々や生き物の命を奪い続けたため「殺生石」と呼ばれるようになり、至徳2年（1385年）には玄翁和尚によって打ち砕かれ、そのかけらが全国に飛散したという。
殺生石が飛散した先は日本各地の「高田」という地名の3ヶ所（諸説あり）とされ、一般には美作国高田（現・岡山県真庭市勝山）、越後国高田（現・新潟県上越市）、安芸国高田（現・広島県安芸高田市）、豊後国高田（現・大分県豊後高田市）、会津高田（現・福島県会津美里町）のいずれかとされる。
「高田」以外の地に破片が散ったとする伝承もあり、飛騨では牛蒡種に、四国では犬神に、上野国ではオサキになったという。

鍛冶が嬶
鍛冶が嬶、鍛冶が媼（かじがかか、かじがばば）は、高知県室戸市に伝わる説話。
ある身重の女が奈半利（現・安芸郡奈半利町）へ向かうために峠を歩いていた。夜になる頃に陣痛が起き、運悪くオオカミが襲って来たが、そこへ通りかかった飛脚に助けられ、木の上へ逃げることができた。オオカミたちは木の上へは爪が届かないので、梯子状に肩車を組んで木の上へ襲いかかろうとし、飛脚は脇差で必死に応戦した。

その内にオオカミたちは「佐喜浜の鍛冶嬶を呼べ」と言い出した。しばらくすると、白毛に覆われた一際大きいオオカミが鍋をかぶった姿で現れ、飛脚に襲い掛かった。飛脚は渾身の力で脇差しを振り下ろすと、鍋が割れると共に人の叫びのような声が響き、オオカミたちは一斉に姿を消した。
夜が明けて峠に人通りが出始めたので、飛脚は女を通行人に任せ、自分は血痕を辿って佐喜浜の鍛冶屋へ辿り着いた。お宅に嬶はいないかと尋ねると、頭に傷を負って寝込んでいるということだった。飛脚は屋内に入り込み、中で寝ていた嬶を斬り倒した。嬶の姿をしていたのはあの白毛のオオカミであり、床下には多くの人骨、そして本物の嬶の骨も転がっていたという。
佐喜浜には現在でも鍛冶が嬶の供養塔が残っている。また佐喜浜を訪れた郷土史家・寺石正路によると、明治時代には鍛冶が嬶の墓石もあったとされ、鍛冶屋の子孫といわれる人々には必ず逆毛が生えていたという。
江戸時代の奇談集『絵本百物語』では「鍛冶が嬶」と題し、オオカミに食い殺された女の霊がオオカミに憑いて人を襲う話となっており（絵本百物語#巻第五を参照）、千疋狼のような特徴は見られないが、挿絵ではオオカミの群れが樹上に向かって梯子状に肩車を組む姿が描かれている。

小池婆
小池婆（こいけばば）は、雲州松江（現・島根県松江市）に伝わる説話。
松江の小池という武家に仕える男が、正月休みに里帰りし、主の登城日前日の朝、未明の内に家を発って主のもとへ向かった。檜山へ差し掛かった頃、オオカミの群れに出くわしてしまい、逃げ場を失って路傍の大木に登り、難を逃れようとした。
するとオオカミたちは梯子状に肩車を組んで男に近付いてきたが、あと少しのところで高さが足りない。一番上のオオカミが「小池婆を呼べ」と吠えたてた。それに応じて1匹の巨大なネコがやって来て、オオカミの梯子を昇って来た。男はネコを待ち受け、腰の刀を抜いてネコの眉間を切りつけた。金属音が響き、ネコもオオカミの群も姿を眩ました。
やがて夜が明けて人の声がするようになり、男は安心して木から降りると、足元に茶釜の蓋が落ちていた。良く見ると、それは見慣れた主の家の茶釜の蓋だった。不思議に思い、男はそれを持って主の家へ向かった。
主の家へ着いたところ、主の母親が昨晩、厠で転んで額に大怪我をしたと大騒ぎになっていた。さらに家の茶釜の蓋がなくなり、探し回っているところだった。男は茶釜の蓋を主に見せて事情を話した。主が母の部屋を覗くと、母は布団をかぶって妙な声で呻いていた。
主は母を怪しいと睨み、布団の上から刀で突き刺した。布団を剥いで見ると、そこには老いたネコの死骸があったという。

弥三郎婆
弥三郎婆（やさぶろうばば）は、新潟県弥彦山を始め、山形県、福島県、静岡県に伝わる説話。中でも、以下の弥彦山の伝説が知られている。
弥彦山の麓に、弥三郎という男が老いた母親と共に暮していた。ある日、弥三郎は山の中でオオカミの群れに出くわしてしまい、大木に登って難を逃れようとした。
するとオオカミたちは梯子状に肩車を組んで男に近付いてきたが、あと少しのところで高さが足りない。一番上のオオカミが「弥三郎の婆を呼べ」と吠えたてた。すると空に暗雲が垂れ込め、その中から毛むくじゃらの腕が現れて弥三郎を掴んだ。弥三郎は必死に刀でその腕を斬りつけると、雲もオオカミも消えてしまった。
弥三郎は、オオカミたちはなぜ自分の母を呼んだのだろうと不思議に思いつつ、斬り落とした腕を持って帰宅した。家では母が布団を被って妙な声で呻いていた。弥三郎が事情を話して件の腕を見せると、母は「これは俺の腕だ!」と叫び、肩口から血を滴らせつつ逃げ去った。この母の正体は鬼婆であり、本物の母は既に鬼婆に食べられてしまった後だったという。
なおこの説話には、弥三郎婆は鬼ではなくオオカミたちを率いる老いたネコだった、鬼婆が後に改心して妙多羅天という神になったなどの多くの異説がある。
妙多羅天の名の祠は山形県東置賜郡高畠町にもあり、羽前国（現・山形県）の伝説では渡会弥三郎という者が母の変化した鬼女に襲われ、その腕を斬り落としたとされ、前述のような弥三郎婆の説話は、この弥三郎の話に上述の「小池婆」のようなネコやオオカミの怪異が混ざって生まれたという説もある。

その他
明治初期に伊勢神宮神官である山口起業が集めた霊験譚『神判記実』にも類話は見られ、紀伊国の樵・岩松がオオカミの群れに追われ、木に登るも、オオカミは背に上って重なり迫ったため、祓詞を唱えると、オオカミ達は降り、地に伏せた。さらに唱え続けると朽ちた枝が折れて落ち、大きな音を立てたため、オオカミは四散して逃げ、助かったとされる。

衣通姫伝説のあらすじ
軽皇子と軽皇女
允恭天皇の御世、その子に木梨軽皇子、軽大娘皇女という兄妹がいた。二人の母方の叔母である八田王女（やたのおうじょ）は美しい女性で、その美しさは衣を通してすらも表れてしまうようだ、という意味を込めて「衣通姫」と呼ばれていたが、軽大娘皇女もまた叔母に似て美しかったため、同様に「衣通姫」と呼ばれていた。
当時は異母兄妹（姉弟）であれば婚姻も認められていたが、同じ母を持つ兄妹（姉弟）が情を交わすことは禁忌であった。この史実から、当時の価値観として子供は母に属するものであると考えられていた、と考察されている。しかし、木梨軽皇子は同母妹であるはずの軽大娘皇女に思慕し、やがて互いにその思いを成就させてしまった。

小竹葉（ささのは）に　打つや霰（あられ）の　たしだしに
率寝（ゐね）てむ後は　人は離（か）ゆとも　愛（うるは）しと
さ寝しさ寝てば　刈薦（かりこも）の
乱れば乱れ　さ寝しさ寝てば
これはその時に木梨軽皇子が詠んだ歌であると伝わる。笹の葉に霰が打つように、人が何を言おうと私は気にしない、こうして寝てしまったからには、薦を刈った後のように何が乱れてしまっても構わない、という意味である。この一連の歌は後世に「夷振の上歌（ひなぶりのあげうた）」と称された。
薦（こも）は川や沼に生える草の一種（マコモを参照）であり、古来日本ではこれを刈り取って乾燥させ、ムシロなどに編んで利用していた。乾燥させる時にバラバラに撒いて置くことから、「乱れ」の枕詞ともなった。
ある朝、允恭天皇が朝食を摂ろうとすると、冬でもないのに汁物が凍りついていた。これは不吉だと考えた天皇は、側近の者にこの事象を占わせた。その者は「身内に良くないことが起こっています。おそらく通じている者がいるのでしょう」と答えたため、二人の仲は周囲に発覚してしまった。占い師が把握しているくらいなので、当時の宮廷では知られてしまっていた事象、関係であったのだと推測される。

軽皇子の流刑
この、当時の倫理観から逸脱した関係を知った群臣の支持は、木梨軽皇子から離れて行き、その弟である穴穂皇子（あなほのみこ、後の安康天皇）の支持者が増えることになった。允恭天皇が崩御した時、本来であれば長子で後継者であるはずの木梨軽皇子が即位するはずであったが、木梨軽皇子を支持する者は少なく、皆は穴穂皇子を支持した。自身の不支持を察した木梨軽皇子は腹心であった大前小前宿禰（おおまえこまえのすくね）に命じて穴穂皇子を討とうと画策したが、逆に追いつめられた上、大前小前宿禰が裏切ったことにより木梨軽皇子は捕えられてしまった。企てが不首尾に終わり、地位を失った木梨軽皇子は以下の歌を詠んだ。

天（あま）だむ　軽の乙女　いた泣かば　人知りぬべし
波佐の山の鳩の　下泣きに泣く
軽の乙女よ（軽大娘皇女のこと。）、そのように泣いては人に知られてしまうだろう、波佐の山の鳩のようにもっと静かに忍んで泣きなさい、というような意味である。さらに以下の歌を詠んだ。

天（あま）だむ　軽の乙女　したたにも
寄り寝てとおれ　軽乙女とも
軽の乙女よ、しっかりと寄り添って寝ていなさい、というような意味である。
その後、木梨軽皇子は四国伊予へ流罪とされることになった。木梨軽皇子は「私は必ず戻ってくるから待っていなさい」と言い残し、流刑地（伊予、現在の愛媛とされる）へ移送させられた。また以下のような歌が伝わる。

天飛（あまと）ぶ　鳥も使ひぞ　鶴（たづ）が音（ね）の
聞こえむ時は　我が名問はさね
寂しくなったら空を行く鳥に私の名を訊ねなさい、そうすればきっとその鳥が私たちの間で言葉を運んでくれるから、というような意味である。この三首を天田振（あまたぶり）という。三首に共通する歌の解釈においては、軽大娘皇女に累が及ばないように、という気遣いが観察される。
一方の軽大娘皇女は、旅立つ兄に歌を献じている。

夏草の　あひねの浜の　蠣貝（かきがひ）に
足踏ますな　明かして通れ
夜の浜で貝を踏んで足を怪我せぬよう、夜が明けてからお通りください、という意味である。これは兎に角、兄の身体を気づかったものであろうと解釈されている。

兄妹の再会
それからしばらくは兄を待ち続けていた軽大娘皇女であったが、やがてこのような歌を詠んだとされている。

君が行き　気長（けなが）くなりぬ　やまたづの
迎へは行かむ　待つには待たじ
あなたが行ってしまってもうずいぶんになりました、もう待ってはいられません、帰ってこられないならば私が参ります、という意味である。「やまたづ」とはニワトコのことで、二つの葉が必ず対になって生えることから、二人の関係をそのようになぞらえ「迎へ」の枕詞としたのであろうと推測されている。
軽大娘皇女は立てた弓が倒れ、また立ち上がり、再び倒れるようにして兄の元へたどり着いた。その時に木梨軽皇子はこう詠んだ。

こもりくの　泊瀬（はつせ）の山の　大峰（おほを）には
幡張（はたは）り立て　さ小峰（をを）には
幡張（はたは）り立て　大峰（おほを）よし　仲定める
思ひ妻あはれ　槻弓（つくゆみ）の　臥（こ）やり臥（こ）やりも
梓弓（あづさゆみ）　起（た）てり起（た）てりも　後も取り見る　思ひ妻あはれ
泊瀬の山の峰に幡を立て、仲を確かめあった愛しい妻、立てた弓が倒れ、また立ち上がり、再び倒れるようにしてやって来るその愛しい妻が、たまらなくあはれだ、という意味である。また続いてこのような歌を詠んだ。

こもりくの　泊瀬（はつせ）の河の
上（かみ）つ瀬に　斎杙（ゐぐひ）を打ち
下（しも）つ瀬に　真杙（まぐひ）を打ち
斎杙（ゐぐひ）には　鏡をかけ
真杙（まぐひ）には　真玉（またま）をかけ
真玉（またま）如（な）す　我が思ふ妹（いも）
鏡如（な）す　我が思ふ妻
ありと言はばこそよ　家にも行かめ　国をも偲ばめ
泊瀬の河の上流に斎杙を打ち、下流には真杙を打ち、斎杙には鏡をかけ、真杙には真玉をかけ、その鏡のように我が思う妹、その真玉のように我が思う妻、おまえがいるからこそ家に帰りたいと思い、国を偲びもするのだ、という意味である。
泊瀬とは現在の奈良県桜井市初瀬にある初瀬河とその周辺のことで、「こもりく」は周囲より低く他からは見えない場所を指し、泊瀬の枕詞である。また「妹」は血縁上の妹を指すというよりも、ここでは愛しい女性をあらわす言葉として使われている。この二首は読歌（よみうた）である。
木梨軽皇子は再会を喜び、二人はわずかな時間を共有し愛し合い過ごしたと推察されるが、やがて二人は自害し、物語は幕を閉じている。

『日本書紀』における衣通姫伝説
『日本書紀』においては、巻第13に衣通姫伝説についての記述がある。その中では允恭24年の夏6月、軽皇子と軽皇女の相姦が発覚し、皇太子を処刑することはできなかったので、軽皇女を伊予に追放したとある。さらに允恭42年春1月に天皇が崩御した後、同年冬10月に穴穂皇子と戦い、形勢不利と悟った大前小前宿禰が軽皇子の助命を穴穂皇子に嘆願するものの、軽皇子は自害したと書かれている。

伝説の実際
この物語は後世に脚色されたフィクションであり、全てをそのまま史実として解釈することはできない。物語中にある歌は全くの別人が詠んだものであろうと推測されている上に、この二人が同母兄妹であったという史学的確証もない。二人の母とされる允恭天皇の皇后忍坂大中津比売命（おしさかのおおなかつのひめのみこと）は多くの子を生んだとされるが、そのうちのほとんどは生母を異にしていた可能性もある。また、同母兄妹婚姻を禁忌としていた記紀編纂当時の社会さえ同母兄妹での婚姻例が多数記録されており、そもそも当時の社会において、同母兄妹婚姻の禁忌が本当に存在していたかどうかの史学的確証はない。
この物語についての解釈として、木梨軽皇子が罪に問われた理由は、近親相姦の罪ではなく衣通姫の公的な巫女としての要件である処女性を喪失させた事に対するものだ、とする説や、本来であれば皇位継承権を持っていた木梨軽皇子が、権力争いの末に穴穂皇子に敗れ、皇位継承から排除された事件を語ったストーリーに尾鰭がついたものである、とする説などがある。

概要
平将門は朝廷に対して乱を起こすも、天慶3年（ユリウス暦940年）2月14日、平貞盛・藤原秀郷連合軍との合戦の最中に流れ矢を額に受け、現在の茨城県坂東市岩井付近で38年の生涯を閉じた。
伝承では、平将門の首は京都まで送られ、京都大路に晒され、後に武蔵国豊嶋郡柴崎村（現在の東京都千代田区）に葬られたとされるが、他に埼玉県幸手市などにも、将門公の首塚とされるものが存在している。
一方、首と離れた将門の胴を葬った「胴塚」に関しても、以下のように複数の伝承がある。

下総国猿島郡岩井村（現在の茨城県坂東市）の神田山（かどやま）延命院境内に弟の平将頼らによって密かに葬られたとする伝承。当地は、平安後期に伊勢神宮へ寄進された相馬御厨の神領であったため、塚はあばかれることなく現在に至っているものという。胴塚の西には、元は千代田区大手町の将門の首塚にあった南無阿弥陀仏の石塔婆が、昭和50年（1975年）、東京の将門塚保存会から寄贈され、移設されている。この地が胴塚とされることについては、かなり新しい説のようだとの見解がある。なお、『関宿伝記』には、神田山延命寺に将門の首を納めた塚があるとの伝承に関する記載がある。
群馬県太田市只上町にある只上神社の胴塚の伝承。伝承によると、藤原秀郷に討たれた将門の遺体は、下野国小俣の鶏足寺へ運ばれる途中、上野国山田郡毛里田村只上の地で声を発したことから、藤原秀郷の人足らはこれを怖れて、将門の胴をここに葬り、祠を建てたという。この祠は「胴筒の宮」と呼ばれ、只上神社の前身となったとされる。
「守谷誌」による、下総国北相馬郡山王村大字岡字仏島（現在の取手市岡）にある古墳（仏島山古墳）は、将門の遺体を葬ったものだとする伝承。
将門戦死の故蹟とされる下総国猿島郡岩井町の国王大明神社にその名をちなむ常陸国真壁郡大国村大字大国玉字公帝に所在する将門塚が、将門の胴を埋めた地であるとの伝承。
平将門の創建になると伝えられる茨城県守谷市高野の大雄山海禅寺には、将門と影武者７人の墓（供養塔）があり、将門の墓は将門の胴塚であるという伝承。

概要
澤蔵司稲荷に伝わる『澤蔵司縁起』によると元和４年（１６１８年）４月７日に傳通院山内の学寮主、極山和尚の夢に一人の僧侶が現われ
「某は澤蔵司というものなるが、浄土の修学大望なるが故に明日当寺に来る」
と託して忽然と消えた。
翌日、この極山和尚の寮へ澤蔵司と名乗る一人の僧が浄土教の修学をしたいと訪ねてきた。その日は寮主が留守だった為、澤蔵司は言付けをして帰った。
さらにその翌日、４月９日に再び澤蔵司は極山和尚の寮を訪ねた。極山和尚は一昨夜の夢といい、その澤蔵司と名乗る僧の容貌の非凡な様を見て４月９日に入門を許可致した。このことを傳通院の住職であった廓山上人へ報告をすると、なんと住職も同じ夢を見ていたのである。
この澤蔵司は、大変に徳が高く才識絶倫優秀にして、僅か３年余りで浄土教の奥義をすべて修得したばかりでなく、様々な奇瑞を現したので多くの方に尊ばれた。
そして、元和６年５月７日の夜、傳通院住職の廓山上人と学寮主の極山和尚の夢枕に再び立ち
「そもそも余は太田道潅公が千代田城内に勧請せる稲荷大明神なるが、浄土の法味を受け多年の大望ここに達せり。今より元の神に帰りて長く当山を守護して法澤の荷恩に報い長く有縁の衆生を救い、諸願必ず満足せしめん。速く一社を建立して稲荷大明神を祀るべし」
と残し暁の雲に隠れたと記されている。
澤蔵司のいた学寮の居室には、念持仏であった十一面観音像と僧形の澤蔵司尊像、『円頓止観』の書、「夏草の歌」、白狐の尾先が残されていた。
この十一面観音像を本地仏とし、澤蔵司尊像をご本尊として祀り、傳通院一山の鎮守として澤蔵司稲荷が建立され現在に至っている。

『縁起』に伝わる奇瑞
傳通院住職の晋山の際の先導
往昔より傳通院の住職の晋山（住職就任式）は夜中に行われていた。この晋山の際の住職が寺に入るお練り行列には、必ず澤蔵司が先導をしたと言われている。この時、もし澤蔵司が緋色の衣を着ていれば、その時晋山する傳通院の住職はその後増上寺の法主になる事ができる。しかし、もし澤蔵司が紫色の衣を着ていたならば、傳通院の住職でそのキャリアを終えると言い伝えられている。

徳本行者の法楽
享和３年１１月に徳本行者が傳通院で修行している修行僧へ浄土宗の伝法を授ける為に、傳通院山内の鸞洲上人の白蓮社という寮に滞在していた。ある日、行者のお世話をしていた大基和尚が深夜にもかかわらず徳本行者の部屋から十念を授ける声を聴いた。不思議に思い行者に尋ねたところ「今、老狐が訪ねてきたのでお念仏を授けた」と仰ったので、大基和尚は「それは、傳通院の鎮守である澤蔵司稲荷の使者ではないでしょうか」と申し上げた。それを聞いた徳本行者は「それならば今すぐその稲荷へ行き法楽したいものだ」と澤蔵司稲荷へ向かった。夜中なので別当寺などには何も言わず自ら提灯を手に出かけたが、澤蔵司稲荷の入り口の鳥居の下に錫杖をつき会釈している出迎えの者がいた。さらには拝殿も本殿も扉がすべて開かれており、灯明などもすべて灯されていたのである。德本行者はしばらく法楽して帰られた。翌朝に澤蔵司稲荷の別当寺慈眼院の別当が徳本行者のもとを訪れ「昨晩行者さまがお参りに来てくださっていたと、今朝聞き知りました。なにもおもてなしできず、ご無礼を致しまして申し訳ございませんでした。」というのである。
昨晩の出迎えや、扉を開け灯明を点けていたのは人がしたことでは無く澤蔵司稲荷の奇瑞であろうと皆口々に話したと伝わる。

境内の夜回りを澤蔵司が代わる
傳通院９世相閑の頃、仁右衛門という７０代の道心の深い者が拝殿の側に住んでいた。仁右衛門は傳通院山内の夜回りをしており拍子木を打ちながら夜ごと歩いていた。雪の夜や雨の晩は澤蔵司が現われ出て「汝休め。予代らん」と言って、代わりに夜回りしたという。これは、道心の深い老人を澤蔵司が憐れんだもので、この澤蔵司が夜回りする姿を見たものは多くいたと伝わる。

太田道灌による勧請
太田道灌は江戸城の前身である千代田城を築城中、乾（北西）の方角にしきりに狐が鳴く声を聴き、さらには忽然とその場所が光るのを見た。不思議に思いその場所を掘ってみると十一面観音像が出土した。道灌は歓喜し「当城の萬代の守護神にしよう」と、その場所に稲荷社を建立し、その十一面観音像を本地仏として勧請し祀った。この時に建立された稲荷社が澤蔵司稲荷である。
現在、この十一面観音像は、澤蔵司稲荷の本堂裏手の神殿内の厨子に澤蔵司尊像と共に安置されている。
もと太田道灌公の念持仏と伝わり、その後、澤蔵司尊が傳通院に入寮した際には澤蔵司尊の念持仏でもあった。澤蔵司尊が修学を終えて、もとの神に戻る際、学寮の居室に澤蔵司尊像と共に残されていたお像と伝わる。

澤蔵司稲荷
澤蔵司稲荷が祀られる稲荷神社。東京都文京区小石川３丁目１７番地１２号にある。
徳川家康の生母於大の方の菩提所である傳通院の鎮守。元和６年に創建され令和２年に開創４００年を迎えた。

別当寺　慈眼院
澤蔵司稲荷は明治時代の神仏分離や廃仏毀釈に遭いながらも、江戸時代よりの神仏習合の姿をよく残している。
澤蔵司稲荷を管理している別当寺は、浄土宗の慈眼院である。
慈眼院は傳通院の山内塔頭寺院であり、澤蔵司稲荷創建当時は甚蓮社という学寮であった。
慈眼院と公称するようになったのは、宝永５年に傳通院１７世住職であった祐天上人が堂宇を再建した際である。
この慈眼院という名称は、傳通院にふたつある鎮守のひとつの大黒天の別当寺である福聚院と対であり、『観音経』の「慈眼視衆生　福聚無量海」から取られたと考えられている。

澤蔵司と蕎麦
澤蔵司が傳通院で修行中、門前に蕎麦を商う店が有った。澤蔵司は大変そばを好み、よくこの店へ蕎麦を食べに行っていた。
この店の主人は、澤蔵司が修行中はその徳を慕って常に供養していたとされ、もとの神に戻り澤蔵司稲荷尊として祀られてからは毎日社前に蕎麦を奉納するようになった。
江戸中期、後期の『澤蔵司縁起』『澤蔵司略縁起』等にも「まだ蕎麦の奉納が続いている」と記され、明治や昭和初期の記録にも「いまだに奉納が続いている」と書かれている。
この門前の蕎麦屋「稲荷蕎麦萬盛」は現在も営業を続けており、その日の初茹で（初釜）のお蕎麦が朱塗りの箱に収められ毎日奉納されている。
開創以来４００有余年連綿とお蕎麦の奉納が続いている。
信仰の対象である本尊が食べた物を、同じお店で食べることが出来るのは世界でも稀有な例と考えられている。

霊窟おあな
本堂の東側の崖地にある霊場。古来より霊狐の棲む霊場として知られ、霊窟「おあな」さまとして親しまれている。
まさに霊場と呼ぶに相応しい雰囲気の場所で石階段を下ると朱塗りの鳥居に囲まれた祠（ほこら）がある。
明治の頃に石組み等の若干の整備はされているが、江戸時代よりの面影を色濃く留めている。
『江戸名所図会』や『無量山境内大絵図』にも描かれており、現在もなお、鎮守の杜に相応しい樹齢数百年の樹木に囲まれ都心とは思えない雰囲気を残している。
これらの木々により、昭和２０年５月２５日の空襲で傳通院方面から類焼してきた火災が止まり、澤蔵司稲荷境内の建物の一部や隣接する住宅には燃え広がらずにすんだ。

ムクノキ
澤蔵司稲荷の境内を出て坂を少し上がった所に一本の椋の木がある。
古来より地元の方々に、澤蔵司尊が宿る御神木として信仰をあつめている。『江戸名所図会』などにも描かれており、木の側には東屋も描かれており、江戸時代にすでにシンボリックな存在であったことがわかる。
平成２５年に文京区天然記念物第一号に認定されたことを記念して、地元町会によって毎年６月上旬に「ムクノキ祭」が澤蔵司稲荷の境内で催されている。

江戸消防との関係
南町奉行・大岡越前守が300年ほど前に制定した、江戸時代の町火消しの組織「いろは四十八組、本所深川十六組」は明治5年に「市部消防組」として改編され、その後、近代消防に移行したことに伴い江戸時代の火消しの文化・伝統等を継承する為に江戸消防記念会の前身組織が明治後期に組織された。現在の「一般社団法人 江戸消防記念会」は 全体で11の区で組織されている。
長年、澤蔵司稲荷において、地元小石川の江戸消防記念会第四区木遣親聲会が木遣りと梯子乗り（共に東京都指定無形民俗文化財）のお稽古をしている。
その関係で、澤蔵司稲荷の本堂には、地元二番組の纏が奉納されており、また、（社）江戸消防記念会 第四区木遣親声会 創立100周年を記念して木遣不動明王が奉納され、年に一度「木遣不動尊祭」を厳修されている。

松尾芭蕉の句碑
「一時雨 礫や降って 小石川」
澤蔵司稲荷では江戸末期頃から芭蕉翁を慕う「芭蕉堂」の句会が開かれていた。その門人によって、大正7年10月12日の芭蕉翁の220回忌を記念して境内に建立された句碑。
句の右側には「戸田権太夫邸にて」と刻されており、延宝5年（1677年）に、芭蕉翁と同郷の戸田権太夫公のお屋敷（本郷壱岐坂　現在の本郷ハウスあたり）から詠まれた句であると伝わる。
石材は川石。昭和20年5月の山手大空襲でも火を被らず現存している。

民間伝承
澤蔵司に関して、澤蔵司稲荷に伝わる『澤蔵司縁起』とは内容の異なる民間伝承が多く伝わる。

縁起に関する民間伝承
江戸にある伝通院の住職廓山上人が京都から帰る途上、澤蔵司という若い僧と道連れになった。若い僧は自分の連れが伝通院の廓山上人だと知ると、学寮で学びたいと申し出てきた。若い僧の所作からその才を見抜いた廓山上人は入寮を許可し、かくして澤蔵司は学寮で学ぶことになった。
澤蔵司は入寮すると非凡な才能をあらわし、皆の関心を寄せた。が、あるとき寝ている澤蔵司に狐の尾が出ているのを同僚の僧に見つかってしまい、上人に自分に短い間ではあったが、仏道を学ばせてもらったことを感謝し、学寮を去った。
その後一年ほどは、近隣の森に住み、夜ごと戸外で仏法を論じていたという。

澤蔵司は僧であった頃蕎麦を好んで食べていた。澤蔵司がひいきにしていた蕎麦屋では、澤蔵司が現れた日、銭に必ず木の葉が混じるので怪しみ、ある晩店の男は蕎麦を買った澤蔵司をつけて行くと、森の中に蕎麦を包んだ皮が散らばっていたという。また、この出来事から店の男が澤蔵司は狐だと感づき、それが原因で澤蔵司は上人に自分が狐であることを打ち明けたと言う説もある。

ムクノキに関する民間伝承
澤蔵司稲荷が宿るとされる御神木のムクノキは「切ると祟られる木」として昭和から平成の頃に怪談話としてよくテレビなどに取り上げられた。
これは、明治時代に生活道として現在の善光寺坂を通すにあたり、このムクノキが伐採の危機に遭った。その際、この木を守るために地域の住民よって流布され始めたものであると考えられている。

歴史
玉藻前の伝説の成立期は室町時代前期以前であると考えられ、古くは史書の『神明鏡』（14世紀後半）、御伽草子の『玉藻の草子』（室町時代）、能の『殺生石』、『下学集』（1444年）などに見られる。『玉藻の草子』の諸本中、古い系統と考えられるものには殺生石説話が見られず、これは後に付加されたものと考えられる。この頃すでに玉藻前の前歴として斑足王の夫人および周の幽王の后の褒姒が挙げられているが、唐土・天竺の条が本格的に語られるのは、江戸時代の高井蘭山の読本『絵本三国妖婦伝』 （1803年 - 1805年）や 岡田玉山の読本『絵本玉藻譚』 （1805年）によってである。この際に殷の妲己もまた玉藻前と関連付けられ、玉藻前は九尾の狐の化身であるとされた。その後の文化文政期には玉藻前の物語が大いに流行し、松梅枝軒・佐川藤太の浄瑠璃『絵本増補玉藻前曦袂』（1806年）をはじめとする多くの作品が作られた。
玉藻前のモデルは、鳥羽上皇に寵愛された皇后美福門院（藤原得子）ともいわれる。摂関家などの名門出身でもない彼女が皇后にまで成り上がり、自分の子や猶子を帝位につけるよう画策し中宮待賢門院（藤原璋子）を失脚させ、崇徳上皇や藤原忠実・藤原頼長親子と対立し保元の乱や平治の乱を引き起こし、更には武家政権樹立のきっかけを作った史実が下敷きになっているという（ただし、美福門院が実際にどの程度まで皇位継承に関与していたかについては諸説ある）。

伝説の概要
以下には『絵本三国妖婦伝』に記載されている伝説を記す。
最初は藻女（みくずめ）と呼ばれたとされ、子に恵まれない夫婦の手で大切に育てられ、美しく成長した。18歳で宮中で仕え、のちに鳥羽上皇に仕える女官となって玉藻前（たまものまえ）と呼ばれる。その美貌と博識から次第に鳥羽上皇に寵愛されるようになった。
しかしその後、上皇は次第に病に伏せるようになり、朝廷の医師にも原因が分からなかった。しかし陰陽師・安倍泰成が玉藻前の仕業と見抜く。安倍が真言を唱えた事で玉藻前は変身を解かれ、九尾の狐の姿（『玉藻の草子』では二尾の狐として描かれている）で宮中を脱走し、行方を眩ました。
その後、那須野（現在の栃木県那須郡周辺）で婦女子をさらうなどの行為が宮中へ伝わり、鳥羽上皇はかねてからの那須野領主須藤権守貞信の要請に応え、討伐軍を編成。三浦介義明、千葉介常胤、上総介広常を将軍に、陰陽師・安部泰成を軍師に任命し、軍勢を那須野へと派遣した。
那須野で、既に九尾の狐と化した玉藻前を発見した討伐軍はすぐさま攻撃を仕掛けたが、九尾の狐の妖術などによって多くの戦力を失い、失敗に終わった。三浦介と上総介をはじめとする将兵は犬の尾を狐に見立てた犬追物で騎射を訓練し、再び攻撃を開始する。
対策を十分に練ったため、討伐軍は次第に九尾の狐を追い込んでいった。九尾の狐は貞信の夢に娘の姿で現れ許しを願ったが、貞信はこれを狐が弱っていると読み、最後の攻勢に出た。そして三浦介が放った二つの矢が脇腹と首筋を貫き、上総介の長刀が斬りつけたことで、九尾の狐は息絶えた。
その後、九尾の狐は巨大な毒石に変化し、近づく人間や動物等の命を奪うようになった。そのため村人は後にこの毒石を「殺生石」と名付けた。この殺生石は鳥羽上皇の死後も存在し、周囲の村人たちを恐れさせた。鎮魂のためにやって来た多くの高僧ですら、その毒気に次々と倒れたが、南北朝時代、会津の元現寺を開いた玄翁和尚が殺生石を破壊し、破壊された殺生石は各地へと飛散したといわれる。
玉藻前の経歴は中国古代王朝殷にまで遡る。殷の最後の王である紂の后、妲己の正体は齢千年を経た九尾の狐であり、王の妾であった寿羊という娘を食い殺し、その身体を乗っ取って王を惑わせたとされる。王と妲己は酒池肉林にふけり、無実の人々を炮烙の刑にかけるなど、暴政を敷いたが、周の武王率いる軍勢により捕らえられ、処刑された。またこの処刑の際に妲己の妖術によって処刑人が魅せられ首を切ることができなくなったが、太公望が照魔鏡を取り出して妲己にかざし向けると、九尾の狐の正体を現して逃亡しようとした。太公望が宝剣を投げつけると、九尾の体は三つに飛散した。

しかしその後、天竺の摩竭陀（まがだ）国の王子、斑足太子（はんぞくたいし）の妃華陽夫人として再び現れ、王子へ千人の首をはねるようにそそのかすなど暴虐の限りを尽くしたが、耆婆（きば）という人物が夫人を魔界の妖怪と見破り、金鳳山中で入手した薬王樹で作った杖で夫人を打つとたちまち九尾の狐の正体を現し、北の空へ飛び去って行った。
周の第十二代の王、幽王の后、褒姒も九尾の狐とされる。褒姒がなかなか笑わないので、幽王はさまざまな手立てを使って彼女を笑わそうとし、ある日何事もないのに王が烽火（のろし）を上げ、諸侯が集まったという珍事に初めて笑ったといわれ、それを機に王は何事もないのに烽火を上げ、諸侯が烽火をみても出動することが無くなり、後に褒姒により后の座を追われた申后の一族が周を攻めたとき、王は烽火を上げたが諸侯は集まらず、王は殺され、褒姒は捕虜にされたが、いつの間にか行方知れずとなっていた。後に若藻という16歳ほどの少女に化け、吉備真備の乗る遣唐使船に同乗し、来日を果たしたとされる。

概要
「田村語り」の中心となる人物は平安時代前期の大納言・坂上田村麻呂がモデルとされ、物語や伝説によっては鎮守府将軍・藤原利仁の伝説と融合されることもある。

あらすじ
現在、田村語りとして一般に知られている筋は、室町物語『鈴鹿の物語（田村の草子）』である。これは大きくふたつの物語に分ける事ができる。

『田村の草子・上』
藤原俊祐の子で幼名を日龍丸と称した藤原俊仁が、近江国見馴川にいる倉光・喰介という2匹の大蛇を退治し、天皇から将軍の宣旨を与えられ、妻の照日御前を拐った陸奥国高山の悪路王を退治するも、唐土に渡り不動明王に敗北するまでの物語。
『田村の草子・下』
藤原俊仁の子で幼名を臥と称した田村丸俊宗が、鈴鹿御前なる天女を妻とし、夫婦で伊勢国鈴鹿山の鬼神・大嶽丸を退治、その後は近江国で人々を拐う鬼・高丸を陸奥国の外ヶ浜まで追撃する物語。

坂上田村麻呂伝説との関係
東北における「田村語り」の発信源は達谷窟の毘沙門堂・西光寺の縁起および「姫待が瀧」の伝説だが、東北地方の「田村語り」と密接な関係のある社寺の縁起として『華足寺縁起』にみえる七観音が挙げられる。これらの縁起や伝説は『田村三代記』の内容と直接関係しつつ創出された。同様の例は松島の瑞巌寺や五大堂、岩手県紫波町の飽玉伝説、宮城県黒川郡の悪玉姫伝説、秋田県仙北郡の阿久多摩姫伝説、鬼死骸や霧山禅定などの地名伝説も挙げられる。

物語の要約
昔、出羽国の独鈷（とっこ）村（現在の秋田県大館市比内町独鈷）に気立ての良い娘がいた。
ある夜、娘の夢に老人が現れ「川上に行けば夫となる男に出合うだろう」と告げる。お告げ通り、娘は川上の小豆沢（現在の鹿角市八幡平小豆沢）で一人の男に出合い、夫婦となって貧しいながら仲睦まじく暮らした。ある年の正月、また老人が夢に現れ「もっと川上に住めば徳のある人になるだろう」と告げる。夫婦は川をさかのぼり現在の米代川の源流に近い田山村（現在の岩手県八幡平市田山）に移り住み、よく働いた。
ある日、夫が野良仕事に疲れうとうとしていると、一匹のだんぶり（とんぼ）が飛んできて、夫の口に尻尾で2・3度触れた。目を覚ました夫は、妻に「不思議なうまい酒を飲んだ」と話し、二人でだんぶりの後を追った。そして、先の岩陰に酒が湧く泉を発見する。酒は尽きることがなく、飲めばどんな病気も癒やされた。
夫婦はこの泉で金持ちとなり、多くの人が夫婦の家に集まってきた。人々が朝夕に研ぐ米の汁で川が白くなり、いつしか川は「米代川」と呼ばれるようになった。夫婦には秀子という一人娘がいた。優しく美しい乙女に成長し、やがて継体天皇に仕えて、吉祥姫と呼ばれた。夫婦も天皇から「長者」の称号を与えられ、「だんぶり長者」として人々に慕われた。
年月が過ぎ、夫婦がこの世を去ると、酒泉はただの泉になった。両親の死を悲しんだ吉祥姫は都から戻り小豆沢の地に大日霊貴神社を建てて供養した。この姫も世を去ると、村人達は姫を大日霊貴神社の近くに埋葬し、銀杏の木を植えた。これが、大日霊貴神社の境内にあった大銀杏と言われている。

地元の伝説と言い伝え
岩手県八幡平市字平又、長者前集落の北方に米代川の源があり、ここに長者屋敷があったとされる（北緯40度10分25.28秒 東経140度58分34.1秒）。長者は直人（なおと）と言われた。長者前集落には現在「長者」という屋号を持つ旧家もある。屋敷に大日神を祭り、秋田県鹿角市八幡平の人たちが石堂に納めている。祭日には八幡平の村人や平又、長者屋敷の集落の人たちが、煮しめや赤飯を供えて、酒盛りをする。
当時長者は1000人の使用人と住んでいた。屋敷前の小川で朝晩食べる米の研ぎ汁が川下7里に渡って白く流れたという。そのため、この川を「米白川」と呼んでいた。今の米代川はそれが転化したものと伝えられている。屋敷内には長者が所有していた漆万杯、黄金億億など数多くの財宝が、朝日と夕日が差す白萩の咲くところに埋まっていると伝えられている。大日神のお告げとか、霊夢のお告げとか、易者の占いなどと言って遠くは北海道や九州からも幾十人かの物好きが探したが、その幸運を掘り当てたと言う人の噂はまだ聞かない。
平又集落に泉山という旧家がある。現在の4代前の先祖が葦毛馬を飼っていた。ある年の夏、放牧していた馬が長者屋敷内に埋めている漆の入ったかめに足を入れ、右足に漆をつけていたのを集落の人が見つけた。人々はその場所を探したが、見つけることはできなかった。泉山家では木枕にこの漆を塗って保存していたという。泉山家には菊の紋がついた仏壇があり、現在も保存している。
正直な夫婦は泉を欲しい人に分けてやった。泉をもらい受けた者は、2度3度になるとその土地から取れる宝物を持参して交換するようになった。伊達郡の人からは黄金のふきめ、比内郡の人たちからは孔雀石、階上郡の人たちからは水漆、津軽郡の人たちからは真珠の珠など、東北各地からそれぞれ贈られるようになった。そして、夫婦はみるみるうちに裕福になり、贈られた宝物は土蔵を建てて入れた。土蔵は48に達し東北一の長者になった。
名久井郡からは角が一本生えた名馬が贈られた。この名馬は一夜のうちに沼の水を飲み干し、一日数百里を走るので龍馬と呼ばれていた。龍馬が住んでいた栗木田集落の上の森を龍ヶ森と言った。
長者の召使いのうちには、目、鼻、手長、足長の4人がおり、それぞれの名が示すとおりの神通力を持っていた。4人は沢山の手下を持ち、山根を招いたり、山や沢頭を切り開いて、田畑を造った。田山から瀬ノ沢を経て花輪に通じる通称花輪越や田山から兄川、畏部（ほろべ）を経て小豆沢を通り比内に通じる道路を切り開き、よく長者を助けた。人間以上に働くので、この4人と手下共を天狗と呼んでいた。天狗共は湯瀬温泉から八幡平（小豆沢）の間を渓谷（湯瀬渓谷）を切り開き橋を一夜にして架けた。これが有名な「天狗橋」と伝えられている。天狗共は天狗橋を架けると、秋田に通じる仙北道を拓くためにでかけた。天狗共は天狗橋を架けるのに時間がかかり、途中で夜が白々と明けはじめ、天狗共は帰ってきてしまい失敗した。この場所は夜明嶋と呼ばれるようになった。
長者は八戸に苗代を作り、これを仙北に水田を作って植えたとされる。また、各地から集まった稲を稲庭長根にハセバを作って乾燥させた。これが稲庭岳の名の始まりと伝えられている。
長者の死の後、供養のため田山に一時帰った吉祥姫の付き添いの粟生連（あわふしらじ）は病で土地の露と消え、不幸が続いた。亡骸を里外れの殿坂に葬り、庵を建てて弔った。その後、弘法大師（空海）が巡業の際にこの庵に泊まり、托鉢をしながら鉈造りの地蔵尊を安置して帰った。村人はこの庵を横堰の地蔵庵と言い、村人が亡くなるとここに葬るようになった。その後、1650年（慶安2年）3月17日に浄法寺福蔵寺の末寺として、曹洞宗の田谷山地蔵寺が建てられた。田谷とは百姓の監督のために、殿様が平時住んでいた所である。現在、地蔵寺には1358年（延文2年）5月25日の日付が記され、幕末に殿坂から地蔵寺に移されたと言われる「殿坂の碑」がある。

『地蔵寺開闢伝』は1803年（享和3年）4月24日に書かれた岩手県八幡平市沢口の曹洞宗寺院である地蔵寺の縁起であり、当時の住職である見桃侍鉄和尚によって書かれたものである。地蔵寺はだんぶり長者の屋敷跡に近く、当時の民衆に伝わる伝説も記録されていて、上記の現代の伝説の幾つかが記録されている。送られた物は伊達郡の人からは黄金のふきしめ百鎰、比内郡の人たちからは孔雀石、階上郡の人たちからは水漆万杯、津軽郡の人たちからは合浦の珠、名久井の里からは摺墨の名馬と言って角が一本生えている名馬に加えて、樺太からは韃靼の錦が送られて来たと書いている。米の研ぎ汁で川下が白く濁り、それが米代川の名の元になったことも書いている。4人の優れた能力を持つ召使いの話も書かれているが「天狗」とは記載されていない。
見桃侍鉄和尚は長者屋敷跡を訪ねて「これを見るに誠に思いがけず荒れ果てた有様だ。樹木も無く川岸が崩落して泉の跡すら見分けられない。地形もはなはだ狭く、豪邸があった故地とも思えない。寂寥な沢辺だけである」とし、だんぶり長者は山野を開拓したために長者と呼ばれたのではないかとし、娘の入内によって長者号を得たことも荒唐無稽だとして一蹴している。
この本の翻刻をした阿部幹男は、『だんぶり長者』はおそらく『法妙童子』や『まつら長者』（『竹生島之本地』）などの影響を受けて成立したものと考えらるとし、たとえば室町時代の小説集である『法妙童子』の冒頭部には「…ここに長者一人おはします、名をばたんひり長者と申ける」とあり「だんぶり長者」はこの長者名を引用したものと考えられるとしている。

だんぶり長者埋蔵宝伝説
伝説の元になった長者は実在したという意見もあり、岩手県八幡平市田山には長者屋敷の礎石が残っていたという。この地方で多く産した漆や砂金を基に長者になったのだろうとする説もあり、砂金を取る際の粘土質の土が川を白く染めたのだろうとも言われている。
だんぶり長者が亡くなる前に、広大な屋敷あるいは近くのどこかに莫大な金銀財宝を埋めて今もあるという伝説がかなり根強く伝えられ残っている。
全部で12説ばかりあり、それを裏付けるように、一部の砂金または金の延板、黄金の瓶子のかけらを発見したという人もいる。明治から昭和初期にかけて、数百人の人々が来て掘って一攫千金を夢見たが、まだこれぞと思うのを掘り当てた者がいないと言う。高瀬博の『尾去沢鉱山伝説 だんぶり長者埋宝秘伝』では、それらの埋宝伝説が5つばかり記録されている。畠山清行の『埋蔵金物語』でもいくつかの埋宝伝説が語られている。
黄金の牛を埋めたと伝えられるのは根石地区で、牛が臥している形の黄金を埋めたので、根石と言われる。これと同じ形の石が今でも屋号で「長者」と言われる家の上方にある。黄金の人形は長者前集落の大日社の近くの天皇林の山頂に埋めたとされる。この他、黄金の財宝は天狗森、四角岳、稲庭岳、ホーラン平天台寺の土ふまずの丘、目名市、土沢地区内に埋められていたとされ、目名市の羽沢家、土沢の北口家は財宝守りではないかと言われている。瀬ノ沢集落の西側（東側？）の黄金沢にも埋められていて、黄金沢の入り口に集落の人が焼屋屋敷（やけやしき）と呼んでいた武家屋敷があったとされる。この家が代々財宝守りをしていたが、火災にあって家族もろとも焼死したと伝えられる。また、矢神岳の山頂付近に30aほどの平坦地がある。この土地を地元の人はジャト屋敷、ザト屋敷と呼んでいた。ここに住んでいた人が財宝守りではないかと言われている。屋敷の近くに大人7人ほどが上がれる大きな石があり、へび石と呼ばれ周囲の石と材料が異なるため、どこからか運ばれて来たとされ、財宝の目印ではないかと伝えられている。

奥浄瑠璃
「だんぶり長者」の物語は、奥羽地方の盲人たちによって語られてきた琵琶や三味線などを伴奏にする奥浄瑠璃などで、神仏・社寺の縁起を説いた本地物の一つとして、江戸時代に語られていた。現在3種の写本が知られている。「檀毘尼長者之本地」
、「鹿角郡田山村檀毘盧長者之本地」、「檀毘尼長者本地」が知られている。成田守の『奥浄瑠璃の研究』(1985年)では翻刻・解題あるいは諸本の比較検討が行われている。
「檀毘尼長者本地」(南部叢書)の解題で金田一京助は「表題の檀毘尼あるいは壇毘尼は、古書に『だんぶり』を往々として『だんびる』とあるからこれもそうよむのであろうが、尼を『ら・り・る』に読むことは難しい。筆録者の誤りであったか、それとも転写の誤りで、あるいは盧であるまいか。毘盧遮那などの毘盧をもって、だんぴるに当てたのが、盧の略体から偶然尼に転写されてきたものか」としている。
元来この伝説は、地元に伝わる素朴な昔話と中世独特の本地垂迹説を受けた神社縁起と物語（古浄瑠璃）とを習合してできた奥浄瑠璃「檀毘盧長者之本地」があって、この地方を漂泊した下級宗教人（山伏、修行僧）や座頭たちによって語られたため、巷間に伝わったものと考えられる。後世地元では度重なる火災で古記録を焼失してしまった為、南部藩に提出する公式記録等もこのフィクションに依らざるを得なかったものと考える。
菅江真澄は「けふのせばのの」で1785年（天明5年）の条で、小豆沢の大日堂の建立由来譚や、奥浄瑠璃の檀毘盧長者之本地譚に近い話を記録している。また『奥々風土記』や『鹿角由来記』にもこれに類する話が記載されている。昔話・伝説の檀毘盧長者之本地譚は秋田県鹿角市に2例、能代市二ツ井町に1例、男鹿市羽立に1例、岩手県安代町に1例、山口県佐波郡に1例確認されている。山口県の昔話は『泉長者』と言われている。

天台寺との関連
だんぶり長者伝説の中には、平安時代にこの地区の宗教的中心であった二戸市浄法寺町の天台寺との関連も伝えられている。裕福になった夫婦には子供がいないという悩みがあり、そのため稲庭岳を越えて（稲庭岳には田山方面からの登山道も昔あったとされる）天台寺の桂泉観世音に21日間通い続け、満願の日の夜に、観音のお告げがあり、姫を授かった。夫婦は桂泉の申し子であるというので、姫を桂姫と名付け、天台寺に鰐口を奉納したという伝説も残されている。天台寺がある浄法寺と田山は深い関係があり、天台寺の山膳や五器等の生産地にはだんぶり長者がいた田山が含まれている。物語では、だんぶり長者は元々京都生まれだが、訳あって若い頃に長牛（ながうし）に住んでいた。小豆沢の酒が好きな老人の養子になり、芝刈りなどで働き、その代金で酒を買い老人に呑ませていたという。姫の死後、勅令により姫と長者の霊を弔うため、大日社が小豆沢と長牛、独鈷にそれぞれ建てられたという。
大日社は天台寺の宗派である天台宗との関連が大きい。三湖伝説の一部の縁起物では、八郎太郎の先祖が大館市独鈷や小豆沢の大日堂の別当であったとするものがある。十和田信仰の宗派は天台宗系の熊野権現である。
だんぶり長者伝説の米代川の白い濁りは、915年の十和田火山の大噴火が原因であるとされている。また天台寺も915年の十和田火山の大噴火によって成立した可能性が語られている。

由来
江戸時代初期、名古屋城築城の際にこの石を石垣に使う目的で運んでいたところ、この地で荷車から落としてしまった。石がどうやっても荷車に戻らないので焦った大名が、村人に固く口止めを命じ、村人は役人に石のことを尋ねられてもつんぼのふりをして何も話さなかった。そこからこの名がついたという言い伝えがある。
この言い伝えには、「落としてしまった」という他に、「わざと廃棄した」とするものもあり、また、口止めを依頼する者についても、「大名」の他に、名古屋城普請奉行の加藤清正とするものから、運搬の責任者である武士とするものまで、いくつかの伝承が存在するようである。また、耳の病に霊験があるとの伝承も存在し、最近まで小石を供えて願をかけたという。

所在地
もともと存在した場所は、徳川義直の廟所がある定光寺・東濃方面へ続く殿様街道と飯田街道の分岐点であった。土中に埋まっていた部分に刻んであった文字などから実際に美濃から運ばれた石であろうと推測されている。
現在は区画整理事業のため近隣の民家の庭先に移設された。つんぼ石の元の所在地の傍らにあった石の道標・石の由来を説明する立て札も同所に移設された。
ちなみに、1905年（明治38年）の瀬戸電気鉄道（現在の名鉄瀬戸線）の開業時、この石の近くに聾石駅（つんぼいしえき）が開業している。その後、聾石駅の廃止と同時に旭前駅が開業し、現在に至っている。

概要
伝説
昔、手石の近くに七兵衛という漁師があった。妻を亡くし、3人の子供を抱えて貧しい暮らしを送っていたが、末子の三平が重い病気にかかった。近くの寺に願を掛け朝夕お祈りをしていると、ある日七兵衛の夢枕に観音様が現れ「洞窟の海底にある鮑を取って食べさせよ」と告げた。七兵衛が小船で洞窟に漕ぎ入ると、奥から金色の光と共に三体の仏様が現れた。目も眩んだ七兵衛が思わず船底にひれ伏し、おそるおそる目を上げると、船の中にはたくさんの鮑が投げ込まれていた。これを食べさせた三平の病気はやがて回復し、その霊験は広く日本全国に知られるところとなったという。

天然記念物の指定
この伝説には異説もあるが、手石の弥陀窟は昭和9年（1934年）12月28日に『手石の弥陀ノ岩屋』の名称で国の天然記念物に指定された。大潮で波の静かな晴天の日の正午頃、この洞窟に小船で入ると、暗闇の中に金色に輝く三体の仏像が現れると言われるが、実際には洞窟の奥に、もう一つ鳩穴という別の小さな穴が本坑に対してT字型に交わり、この鳩穴を通じて洞内に差し込む日光が、洞内の岸壁の凸部を照らすことによって、あたかも暗闇の中に金色の阿弥陀像のように見えるものと考えられている。

説が生まれた背景
天海（慈眼大師天海）は高名な僧であった割には前半生が詳細には知られていなかった。『天海傅（全2巻）』『東海記』『胤海記（東叡山開山慈眼大師縁起）』は天海の業績を記した江戸時代の文書だが、蘆名氏の縁者で会津の出身とあるだけで、生誕地や歳時を明確には記述していなかった。
大正5年（1916年）に天海の伝記『大僧正天海』を刊行した須藤光暉は、天海は船木兵部少輔景光と妻の蘆名氏の子であるという『東海記』の記述を採用しているが、天海の両親と生年について9つの異説があるとして以下のごとく列記して説明している。

第11代将軍足利義澄の子、永正6年9月18日生まれ（『福山藩士三浦小五郎系譜』）
下野国の守護宇都宮正綱の妹の子で蘆名盛高の母の養子、永正7年生まれ（『宇都宮彌三郎系圖』）
第11代将軍足利義澄の末子で母は蘆名盛高の娘、永正7年生まれ（『北越太平記』）
記載なし、永正8年生まれ（『王代一覧』）
第11代将軍足利義澄の次男の亀王丸、永正9年正月生まれ（『足利系図』）
記載なし、永正15年生まれ（『本朝続々史記』）
古河高基（古河公方足利高基）の四男、天文11年生まれ（『参州松平御系図大全』）
姓は三浦氏で奥州高田郷の出身、天文年間の生まれ（『和漢三才図會』）
蘆名盛高の一族で船木氏の子、天文22年生まれ（『陸奥国大沼郡高田郷龍興寺縁起』）
須藤はさらに同様のものとして6つの異説を追加説明しているが、父として名があがるのは足利義澄・足利高基・船木道光または景光で、母方が蘆名氏、宇都宮氏、三浦氏などが出てくるが、明智光秀の父とされる人物の名はない。
同書の中で須藤は、一部の考証家に「天海は明智光秀が後身なり、光秀山崎の一戦に敗れ、巧みに韜晦隠匿して、出家して僧になり、徳川家康に昵懇して、深く其帷幕（いばく）に参し、以て豊臣氏を亡滅し、私かに当年の恨みを報いたり」という「奇説」を唱えるものがいると批判している。大正頃にはすでにこの説が唱えられていたとみられるが、須藤は、明智光秀が天海となったという説は全く根拠がないものだとして、天海の生地や生年が不明なことを悪用して「誰か異説を造作し、妄誕を附會する者あらんや」とデタラメであると怒っている。
南光坊天海＝明智光秀説なるものを示すような同時代史料は全く存在せず、中世史家の小和田哲男などの歴史学者の間においても「この説は広く支持されているものではない」としているが、会計学者の岩辺晃三のような支持者も存在する。

本能寺の変後の生存説
明智光秀は天正10年（1582年）の山崎の戦いの後に討たれたとされているが、山崎の戦い以降に光秀が存命していたとする説や伝承がいくつかある。ただしこれらの説は、光秀が天海になったと明示されていない。

京都宇治の専修院と神明神社には、山崎の戦いの後に明智光秀を匿った伝承が残されている。
『和泉伝承誌』によると、山崎の戦いの後に明智光秀が京の妙心寺に姿を現し、その後光秀は和泉に向かったと書かれている。
本徳寺（現在は大阪府岸和田市にあるが、開基時には大阪府貝塚市鳥羽にあった）には、一時、明智光秀が潜伏していたという伝承があり、「鳥羽へやるまい女の命、妻の髪売る十兵衛が住みやる、三日天下の侘び住居」という俗謡が残っている。
比叡山の叡山文庫には、俗名を光秀といった僧の記録がある。
光秀が亡くなったはずの天正10年（1582年）以後に、比叡山に光秀の名で寄進された石碑が残っている。
岐阜県山県市中洞には、光秀が落ち延び、「荒深小五郎」と改名して関ヶ原の戦い頃まで生き延びたという伝承がある。

天海と明智光秀の関係を窺がわせる根拠
同一人物説論者が根拠とするものには以下のようなものがある。

日光に明智平と呼ばれる区域があり、天海がそう名付けたという伝承がある。
徳川家光の乳母には、明智光秀の重臣の斎藤利三の子の春日局が採用され、家光の子の徳川家綱の乳母には、明智光秀の重臣の溝尾茂朝の孫の三沢局が採用されていること。
山崎の戦いで明智側についた京極家は、関ヶ原の戦いの折に西軍に降伏したにもかかわらず戦後加増された。一方、光秀寄騎でありながら山崎の戦いで光秀に敵対した筒井家は、慶長13年（1608年）に改易されていること。
明智光秀の孫の織田昌澄は大坂の陣で豊臣方として参戦したが、戦後に助命されていること。
明智光秀と天海は地蔵菩薩を信奉していたこと。それぞれの地蔵菩薩像は京の廬山寺、江戸の正徳院に奉納され現存している。
天海の墓所（慈眼堂）が、明智光秀の居城があった近江坂本にあること。

概要
江戸時代において、子供が消息を絶つ原因は天狗とされていた。天狗が子供をさらい、数ヶ月から数年の後に元の家へ帰しておくのである。
天狗攫いから戻って来た子供は、天狗と一緒に空を飛んで日本各地の名所を見物させてもらった、などと話す。到底信じがたいことではあるが、当時としては実際にその場所へ行かなければわからないようなことをその子供が喋ったりするので、その子の言い分を信じるよりほかないということになる。また、天狗から様々な知識や術を教わったとする子供もいたという。
また長野県などでは、天狗にさらわれるという噂のある場所では「鯖食った、鯖食った」と唱えるとその難を逃れるといわれた。これは天狗が鯖を嫌いなためであるらしい。ほかの地方でも誰かが山で行方不明になった際、「鯖食った＊＊（名前）」と呼ぶと戻ってきたという話がある。
天狗攫いでよく知られているのは、天狗小僧の異名をとる文政年間の江戸の少年・寅吉である。彼は7歳のとき天狗攫いに遭い、数年後の文政3年（1820年）に江戸に戻って来て人々を驚かせ、自身の異界での体験談をもって国学者・平田篤胤の著書『仙境異聞』の執筆に協力した。詳細は平田篤胤の項を参照。

隠れ蓑笠との関連
ある若者が、木筒の穴をのぞき、「江戸が見える、大阪が見える」と言って、天狗の興味を惹き、騙された天狗が隠れ蓑笠（この蓑をまとうと姿が見えなくなり、燃えた灰にも効力がある）とただの木筒を取りかえる話があるが、これは化け蟹にも見られる「化け物問答」と呼ばれる型の民話の一種である。ようは、問題が解けなければ、妖怪に食べられてしまうという内容である。天狗の蓑笠を騙し取った若者も、怠けて酒を飲むために用いたことからも分かる通り、子供的に描かれている。また、秋田県の鬼であるナマハゲにも見られるように、蓑を身にまとった存在とは、古来、常世からの来訪者を意味していた。これらのことから、蓑をまとった天狗と問答をするくだりは、神隠しとも関連性があるテーマであるとされる。

天狗攫いと男色
人見蕉雨の『黒甜瑣語』（1795年）には、当時神隠しに遭って帰ってきた少年や男たちは「天狗の情朗」と呼ばれていたとある。情朗は「陰間」とも呼ばれ、神隠しの犠牲者は邪な性的欲求の犠牲者と認識されていた。この認識は広く浸透していたようで、平田篤胤も門人を介して寅吉に、天狗の世界では男色は行われていなかったかと質問したところ、寅吉は「ほかの天狗の山はいざ知らず自分が修行した山では男色の風などなかった」と返答している。柳田國男は『天狗の話』のなかで、天狗攫いは実際には悪質な修験者や「山の民」が、性的欲求を満たすために人里で美少年を拉致していたものだと推測している。

概要
宇都宮市塙田（はなわだ）に「百目鬼」という地名があり、百目鬼が関わる伝説が残されている。いくつか別々のかたちの話が伝えられているが、どれにも鬼は登場している。現在は「百目鬼通り」という小路の名などに「百目鬼」という呼び名が残されている。

兎田の百目鬼
大曽（宇都宮市大曽）を通りかかった藤原秀郷（ふじわらのひでさと）のもとにふしぎな老人が現われ「大曽村の北西にある兎田という馬捨場にゆけ」と告げたので向かったところ、十丈はあろうかという大きさで、百の目をもつ刃のような髪の鬼が姿を見せたので、弓を射って退治したとされる。矢を受けて去った百目鬼は明神山で倒れたが毒気と炎を放ちつづけ、本願寺（宇都宮市塙田、後に宇都宮市鶴田町に移転）の智徳（ちとく）という僧の法力によって成仏をするまで人々を困らせていたという。
成仏する以前の百目鬼が、失われた自身の「血」を集めることによって体を再生させようとしていたという内容が語られることもあるが、この内容は百目鬼の伝説が書き留められた初期の文献（1960年に発行された『宇都宮市六十周年誌』）などには登場しない。

百穴の百目鬼
長岡の百穴には昔、百匹の鬼を従えた鬼が棲んでいたが「鬼のような世界からは出たい」と発願。本願寺（宇都宮市塙田）に通って仏門に帰依した結果、人間に生まれ変わることが出来た。百匹の鬼の頭目だったことに由来して「百目鬼」という地名がついたとされる。本願寺に人間になった百目鬼が感謝のしるしとして置いていった親指の爪と水晶の数珠が残されているという。

郷土玩具
夕顔の実を利用した鬼のお面（かんぴょう面）が郷土玩具としてつくられており、これは百目鬼にちなんでつくられたものとされている。

概要
下地島北西部の海岸近くにある大小2つの円形の池で、一の池と呼ばれる海側（南側）の池が直径75メートル、水深45メートル、二の池と呼ばれる陸側（北側）の池が直径55メートル、水深25メートルである。地上からは2つの池が並んでいるように見えるが、これらは地下でつながっており、さらに海側の池は洞穴で海とも通じている。「通り池」という名は、このような池の構造に由来する。この地形は、海岸にあった鍾乳洞が、波によって侵食されて大きくなり、天井が部分的に崩落して形成された陥没ドリーネに海水が浸入したものである。池の周辺には石灰岩が点在するカレンフェルトと呼ばれるカルスト地形が発達している。
この池は海とつながっているために潮の干満につれて水面が上下し、サーモクラインによって色が変化して見える。また、深度によって塩分濃度や水温に差があるため、多種多様な魚介類が分布しており、サーモクラインによる神秘的な景観とも相まって、絶好のダイビングスポットとなっている。
このような地形は希少であり、また、周囲に学術上貴重な植物が分布していることから、通り池は、2006年7月28日に国の名勝及び天然記念物に指定されている。名勝と天然記念物との二重指定は33年ぶりのことである。なお、この指定によって通り池でのダイビングが規制を受けることはないとされる。
下地島の西海岸には、通り池と同様の陥没ドリーネが点在している。通り池のさらに先には、鍋底池（鍋底）というやや小さい池がある。この池も、通り池と同様に洞窟で海につながっており、ミニ通り池とも呼ばれている。鍋底池までは2002年に遊歩道が整備されていたが、2016年の台風で損壊して通り池から先は通行止めになっている。

伝説
神秘的な景観を見せる通り池にはいくつかの伝説が残っている。

ユナイタマ（ヨナタマ）伝説
1748年の『宮古島記事仕次』には、次の伝説が収録されている。

この伝説は次の形でも伝承されている

また別の形では、漁師の名は後前（あとめー）タカッチャと云い、よなたま（ユナイタマ）は人面魚体の人魚で食べるために炙られて母人魚に助けを求めたため、津波が起きた、とされている。
この伝説中の大波とは、1771年（明和8年）の八重山地震の津波（明和の大津波）ともされる。しかし、この伝説は、上述の通り、この津波以前の1748年に書かれた『宮古島紀事仕次』に収録されており、先島地方には明和の大津波以前にも何度も津波が襲来しているので、この伝説はそれらの津波に由来するものとも考えられる。
『宮古島紀事仕次』には、「よなたまといふ魚」等と記されており、ユナイタマはジュゴンであるという記述はない。大正・昭和初期に活躍した郷土史家・稲村賢敷は、ユナ（海）・タマ（魂・精霊）で、海の精霊のことだとその著書のなかで解釈している。また、柳田国男もヨナタマは海霊であり、「ヨナが海という言葉と同じではなかろうか」と述べている。
継子伝説
1727年の『雍正旧記』には、次の伝説が収録されている。

この伝説は次の形でも伝承されている。

これは、海側の池にまつわる話で、現在でも池のそばには「継子台」と呼ばれる岩場が残っている。

埋蔵金について
発端
1868年4月に江戸城が無血開城となった際、当時財政難に喘いでいた明治新政府は幕府御用金を資金源として期待していた。ところが城内の金蔵は空であったため、幕府が隠匿したと判断した新政府軍による御用金探しが始まった。
探索の手は、大政奉還当時勘定奉行であった小栗忠順にも及んだ。小栗は奉行職を辞任した後、上野国（群馬県）群馬郡権田村に隠遁していた。彼が幕府の財政責任者であったことから「小栗が幕府の金を持って逃げた」といった流言が飛び、さらには「利根川を遡って来た船から誰かが何かを赤城山中へ運び込むのを見た」と証言する者まで現れた。加えて小栗が江戸城開城に伴う幕府側の処分者の中で唯一、命に関わる刑罰（斬首）となったことも重なり、「幕府の隠し金が赤城山に埋められていることは事実である」と信じた人々が赤城山の各所で発掘を試みた。
その後、赤城山に眠る徳川埋蔵金は以下のようなものであると定義された。

幕府の将来を憂慮した大老井伊直弼により莫大な金を赤城山麓に埋蔵することが企画された。
井伊が暗殺された後、軍学者であった林靏梁によって埋蔵が実施された。
埋蔵された額はおよそ360万から400万両。この額の根拠は、勝海舟の日記にある「軍用金として360万両有るが、これは常備兵を養う為の金で使うわけにいかない。」との記述が元と思われる。
埋蔵に際しては中国の兵法の一つである「八門遁甲」が施され、各所に偽計が張り巡らされている。
山中にある双永寺は埋蔵時、見張り所とされていた。
小栗忠順は機を見て埋蔵金を掘り返し、幕府再興を画策する役を負っていた。

存在の証拠
徳川埋蔵金の存在を示す証拠として、以下のようなものが挙げられている。

東照権現の黄金像 - 明治23年（1890年）、源次郎の古井戸から出たとされる。
銅製の燈明皿 - 明治23年 源次郎の古井戸から出たとされる。
大義兵法秘図書（たいぎへいほうのひずしょ） - 明治24年（1891年）、児玉惣兵衛宏則なる人物が書き残したとされる。
意味不明な文字や絵図が刻まれた3枚の銅板 - 双永寺の床下から出たとされる。
直径が20メートルもある巨大な石灰の亀 - 2代目義治が山中で発掘したとされる。
亀と同じ大きさの石灰の鶴 - 昭和38年（1963年）に亀の近くで発見したとされる
萬四目上覚之帳（よろずしめあげちょう） - 源次郎が保管していたとされる。

各地の説
赤城山での発掘が次々と失敗に終わっていく中、一部の人々は赤城山を本当の埋蔵場所を隠すための囮だと考えるようになり、「真の埋蔵場所」を求めて持論を展開するうちに、各地で埋蔵金伝説が誕生した。以下にその一部を記す。

日光山内（東照宮、二荒山神社など、それぞれの論により詳細な場所は異なる）
男体山、中禅寺湖、明智平（いずれも奥日光）
榛名山、妙義山（赤城山を加えて上毛三山と言われる）
備前楯山（足尾銅山の坑道）
上野東照宮、久能山東照宮、日吉東照宮、世良田東照宮など各地の東照宮
このうち、世良田東照宮にはかつて上毛三山になぞらえられた小高い丘が存在している。

都市伝説の一つとして、童謡「かごめかごめ」の歌詞中に埋蔵金の在り処を示すとしているものがある。詳細は「かごめかごめ」の項目を参照。
赤城山にも諸説あり（津久田原・長井小川田・芳ヶ沢・双永寺・年丸橋（小川田橋）説など）。
群馬県昭和村長者久保。
上海。

その他の説
他にも徳川埋蔵金については様々な説が出されている。

久能山御用金説
徳川家康が残した軍用金は久能山東照宮に納められたが、神柩を日光へ移す際に江戸城へと運ばれた（久能山御蔵金銀）。そのほとんどは日光東照宮の造営や徳川家光の上洛などで使い果たされたとされているが、実は裏帳簿により一部が残されて埋蔵金となった。
他家埋蔵金説
江戸幕府は各地に残る大名の埋蔵金伝説をもとに、発掘プロジェクトを実施している。「結城埋蔵金」など、その全ては失敗に終わったとされているが、実は成功したものがいくつかあり、それらをまとめて埋蔵した。
国家予算流用説
第二次世界大戦直後の日本政府がそうであったように、いかに財政難とはいえ、破綻していない以上は国家として事業を運営するための資金は常備されているものである。国家の大事として大老と勘定奉行が画策したのであれば、国家予算の一部を埋蔵して機に備えるということも十分に考えられる。

埋蔵金架空説（埋蔵金非実在説）
もともと幕末期の江戸幕府が大赤字に見舞われていたため、埋蔵金にあてがうだけの金銭・蓄財が存在するはずがない、という説も一方で唱えられている。実際に徳川埋蔵金は多くの発掘計画が各地で行われているが、そのほとんどが成果を出しておらず、埋蔵金自体も発見されていないことから、架空説も根強く存在する。以下にその理由を述べる。

江戸幕府は初代将軍以降、数々の城や寺社の普請、江戸を見舞った数度の大火被害の復興資金などの支出が続いた。5代将軍綱吉の治世頃には既に財源が枯渇しており、不足分は貯蔵してあった蓄財を切り崩して賄われた（「久能山御蔵金銀」など）が、それもやがて使い切った。農村体型を基本とする江戸幕府の財源はこれらの支出に耐えられず、貨幣改鋳をたびたび行わなければならないほどの事態に陥っていた。その後、新井白石による正徳の治や、8代将軍吉宗による享保の改革などの倹約令や税収見直し、あるいは田沼意次による重商主義的な改革（田沼時代を参照）など財政改革が幾度となく実施されたが、それでも幕府の財政難は改善されることはなく、むしろ悪化の一途をたどり、さらに幕末に連発した大地震や飢饉により、末期の幕府は困窮の極みにあった。
日本の開国後、幕府は軍事力を増強（大量の武器・軍艦を購入）するために巨額の資金を投入している。いわゆる埋蔵金伝説において、資金を秘匿し、埋蔵を画策したとされる小栗忠順は、史実では造船所などの建設を主導し、大量の資金を投入（散財）している責任者である。すなわち、将来の再興を期して資金を貯蔵し秘匿する“埋蔵金”という存在自体が、いま現在の幕府の存続のため、急速に軍備を充実させるための資金投入を惜しまなかった、史実として伝わる小栗の行動と矛盾する。
そもそも巨額の資金があるなら、幕府軍はもっと軍備増強にその資金をつぎ込むのが自然であり、幕府存続の危機的状況において資金を蓄財しておくことはできなかったし、必要性はなかったはずである。
仮に秘匿されて明治維新を乗り越えた蓄財があるとしても、維新以降に静岡藩へ移され、元幕臣らの生活を守り、また牧之原台地の開墾などに資金が必要だった徳川宗家が、この資金の活用に着手しないはずがない。
江戸城では何千人もが働いており、開城の混乱に紛れて1人が200から300両ずつ持ち逃げしたとするならば、400万両ほどはすぐになくなる。
また、幕府御用金400万両は蒸気船「早丸」に隠されていたが、久里浜沖の海獺島付近で暗礁に乗り上げ沈没してしまったという伝説もある。
これらの理由をもって、末期の幕府には秘匿する余剰の金など到底存在しないことから、徳川埋蔵金は架空の存在でしかなく、実在性はないとするのが「埋蔵金架空説」である。

埋蔵金の所有者
もし埋蔵金が見つかった場合、以下のような手続きがなされると予想される。

発見者は文化財保護法第57条の2の規定により、ただちに文化庁長官宛に江戸時代後期の遺構が発見されたことを書面で報告しなければならない。また、発見後は災害等の緊急避難的措置を除き、現状維持をしなくてはならない。
文化庁長官はその歴史的価値を考慮した上で発掘調査を行うかどうかの判断を行うとされているが、本文では徳川埋蔵金は「歴史的価値の高い文化財」であるとの認識で以降記述する。その場合、文化庁の機関または管轄する地方公共団体の教育委員会により発掘調査が施行されることになる。
以降、発見者は独自の判断で発掘を行うことはもちろん、許可が無ければ埋蔵金に触ることもできなくなる。
発掘調査により埋蔵金が徳川幕府の埋蔵金であるという客観的証拠が発見された場合
大政奉還以降の取り決めによって、徳川幕府の資産は全て明治新政府に引き渡されることになっている。つまり所有権は現在の政府にあると認定される。
遺失物法の規定により埋蔵金の5%から20%に当たる報労金が支払われる。なお、この報労金の代わりに埋蔵金現物を引き渡すことも法律上可能であるが、その判断は所有者である政府に委ねられる。
政府に引き渡された埋蔵金は国庫に帰属し、文化財保護法の規定に従い管理される。
発掘調査でも埋蔵金が徳川幕府の埋蔵金であるという確証が得られなかった場合
文化財保護法第59条の規定により、遺失物として所管の警察署長より公告がなされる。
所有者の申し出が無い場合、文化庁の機関が発掘した場合は、文化財保護法第63条の規定により、埋蔵金の2分の1に相当する額の報償金が支給され、埋蔵金は国庫に帰属する。教育委員会が発掘した場合は、同法63条の2およびその自治体の条例等に従い、埋蔵金の額に相当する額の報償金が支給され、管轄する都道府県に帰属する。
報償金を算定する基準となる「埋蔵金の価額」は、文化庁または教育委員会が決定するため、市場価格とは異なる可能性がある。
発見場所の地権者と発見者が異なる場合、報償金は両者の間で折半することとなる。

マスメディアなどによる推理・発掘
1990年6月、TBSのテレビ番組『ギミア・ぶれいく』で、糸井重里を中心としたプロジェクトチームを結成。約2年半にわたって計10回の発掘作業が行われた。自称超能力者の助けを借りるなどして埋蔵箇所を「源次郎の井戸」と推定し、大型重機を使用した大掛かりな発掘を試みた。江戸時代以降に掘られたと見られる穴や遺物を多数発見したが、埋蔵金に直接つながるような発見はなく、プロジェクトチームも解散した。1999年12月31日から2000年1月1日にもTBSの年またぎ特別番組『超える!テレビ』内で同様の発掘企画が放送され、2008年にも『ギミア・ぶれいく』の後継番組『バラエティーニュース キミハ・ブレイク』が同様の発掘企画をした。
TBSの『林修の歴史ミステリー 徳川家260年最大の謎 隠された財宝3000億円徹底解明スペシャル』（2016年12月21日放送）では、同局の『徳川埋蔵金シリーズ』の最新版として赤城山中にて再度の発掘調査を行った。その後、『林修の歴史ミステリー 徳川家260年最大の謎 3000億円埋蔵金大発掘 最終決戦スペシャル』（2017年5月6日放送）で再度発掘を行った。

概要
石燕による解説文には「函関外史（かんかんがいし）云（いわく） ある女生れて手長くして つねに人の銭をぬすむ 忽（たちまち）腕に百鳥の目を生ず 是鳥目（ちょうもく）の精也 名づけて百々目鬼と云 外史は函関以外の事をしるせる奇書也 一説にどどめきは東都の地名ともいふ」とある。「ある女」から「百々目鬼と云」までは「盗癖のある女性の腕に、盗んだ鳥目（金銭）の精が鳥の目となって無数に現れたのでこれを百々目鬼と呼んだ」との意味だが、銅銭は中央の穴が鳥の目を髣髴とさせるところから鳥目（ちょうもく）という熟語があり、「百目鬼」「百目貫」「百目木」などと書いて「どどめき」「どうめき」と読む地名が日本各地にあることから、百々目鬼はこの銅銭の異名と地名の文字から石燕が連想をして描いた創作妖怪と解釈されている。また、金銭のことを「おあし」と俗称することから「足が付く」という洒落から描かれた妖怪ではないかとも考えられている。
同時代の書物や草双紙での百々目鬼の登場や、『函関外史』という書物は確認されていない。しかし本文に見られる「函外以外」という文字には（はこねからさき／箱根から先）という左傍訓もつけられており、「函」は箱根・「関」は関所を意味したものであることは明確にされている。「奇書」という言葉などがあえて入っている点なども含めると、『函関外史』という出典の存在自体も石燕による遊びの創作である可能性もある。

類似の作例
鳥山石燕以外の江戸時代の絵画に、全く同様の情報を持った百々目鬼が描かれている例はないが、出版されていた妖怪を題材にしたかるたの中に「とさの山ごへのどど目鬼」（土佐の山越えのどど目鬼）という札があり、腕や頭に目が数多くある絵が描かれている。また、読み方が「どどめき」であるのかは不明であるが「百々眼鬼」（百目も参照）という名前が描かれた肉筆画も確認できる。いずれも体に多くの目を持つ妖怪ではあるが、それ以外の共通点はない。

昭和・平成以降の解説
石燕による名称表記は「どどめき」であるが、昭和以降の妖怪をあつかった書籍では「とどめき」という表記が名前に使われることも多い。また、腕にある数多くの目は、百々目鬼がかすめとっていた銭が腕に貼りついて目に変化したものである、という解説がよくされるようになった。

伝説のあらすじ
人々が地上に暮らすようになって間もない頃の河辺郡、仙北郡、平鹿郡、雄勝郡は、「鳥の海」と呼ばれる広い湖であった。
あるとき塩釜（現在の宮城県）から、塩釜神社に祀られた塩釜大明神の子孫「明永長者」(みょうえいちょうじゃ)、「明保長者」(みょうほちょうじゃ)という2人の兄弟がやって来た。兄の明永長者が病に倒れたため、2人は近隣の民家に助けを求めた。その家の娘の献身的な看護のおかげで明永長者は快復した。
2人はその家の主人に誘われて船で湖へ出た。湖面の向こうにそびえる鳥海山、背後の御嶽山の森などに見とれるうち、水戸(河辺郡)付近の谷間から湖水が流れ出ているのを見つけた。ここを切り水を捌けば広い平野が得られると明永長者は考え、明保長者も頷いた。主人は驚いていたが、2人は彼の娘にお礼の小袖を置いてその家を去った（旧山内村外山(そでやま)の地名の由来といわれている)。
2人は湖の下流、水上浦(みなかみうら)という場所で神々に工事成就を祈願したが、そこへ老婆が現れて酒を勧めた。その酒はいくら飲んでも無くならず、気付けば老婆はいない。老婆が龍神様の化身だと気付いた2人は、この場所を女造酒(めめき)村と名付けた(旧雄和町女米木といわれている)。
干拓工事が始まった。女造酒の西北の谷を掘った土は人夫が「猿手」(さるで)という道具で運んだ(旧雄和町左手子（さでこ）の由来といわれている)。
工事は長期間に及んだが、やがて谷が開くと湖水は懸河となって日本海へと流れ出た。そこへ「だいだらぼっち」という巨男が現れた。その右足は奥羽山脈の麓の長者森(横手市)に、左足は出羽山地の八沢木(旧大森町)にあり、彼が水をかいたり泥をすくったりしたため水は順調に抜けていった。彼は太平山の森へと去った。三吉神社の化身であったと思われる。
明保長者はこの新しい平野に住み着き、地元の人々に灌漑や農業の技術を教えた。人々は彼に「副川長者」(そえかわちょうじゃ)という名を献呈し、のちに副川神社を建立した。
明永長者はこの平野を山北(「やまきた」。のちの仙北(せんぼく))と名付けた。彼も農業の知識を人々に教授した。彼は御嶽山の国見峠から平野を見回した。また彼は人々を集めて酒を振るまい、神楽を演奏して、工事の成功を祝ったという。以上が御嶽山・塩湯彦神社(しおゆひこじんじゃ)に伝わる伝説である。
横手市には「明永町」という地名が残り、同町の熊野神社付近には「明永沼」がある。そこから御嶽山が見える。

伝説の背景
横手盆地の形成
伝説の舞台となる横手盆地は、雄物川とその支流がつくったいくつもの沖積地からなる、面積は693.59平方キロメートルで、東京23区や琵琶湖の面積に匹敵する広大かつほぼ低平な盆地である。秋田県南東部から北西方向に流れる雄物川は、秋田市雄和女米木、雄和左手子付近の狭搾部では両側から山地が迫る間を大きく蛇行し、日本海へと流れ下っている。
第三紀の末頃から、現在の東北地方にあたる地域に、太平洋プレートの西進を原因とする東西方向からの圧縮力が加わるようになった。そのため褶曲と逆断層が交互に生じ、縦にしわが並ぶように低地と高地が交互に現れた。秋田県から岩手県にかけて、低地(秋田平野)、山地(出羽山地)、低地(横手盆地)、山地(奥羽山脈)、低地(北上盆地)、山地(北上山地)という地形の配置となった。

第四紀になると、山地は圧縮力によりさらに隆起し、低地はさらに低くなってそこに河川が大量の土砂を運んだため、厚い堆積物に覆われた盆地が発達していった。横手盆地の奥羽山脈沿いには現状でもいくつかの扇状地が形成されているが、横手市平鹿町上吉田から同市大雄阿気を経て大仙市角間川に至る広範囲にわたって緩勾配ながら扇状地状の様相を呈しており、これを小田島宏は「古雄物川扇状地」と呼称している。また、横手盆地の中央部、下吉田、田村の両地区の地表近くには、そこが湿地帯であったことを示す泥炭層が分布しており、最も新しい泥炭層は完新世(約5,000年前)まで下るという分析結果が出ている。
約1万年前、完新世に入ると、それまで続いていた氷期が終わり、気温の上昇により縄文海進が起こった。縄文海進の最も進んだ縄文時代早期末葉から前期前葉にかけては、海面の高さは現在よりも3メートルないし5メートル前後高かったと考えられる。河川の水量も多かったとみられ、とくに勾配の緩やかな横手盆地は蛇行帯も広く、現在、盆地における最低位段丘とされる標高差数メートルの河岸段丘も、この時期あるいはこれに相前後して形成された可能性がある。雄物川は盆地内でその流路を幾度か変え、やがて奥羽山脈側(東側)から支流の河川が土砂を運び現成扇状地ないし沖積地を発達させたことで、流路を徐々に西へ移動させていったものと推定される。

満徳長者・地福長者伝説
「鳥の海の干拓」の長者伝説は「三熊野社別華厳院古記」に記載された伝承であるが、これとは別に「秋田六郡三十三観音巡礼記」には、

長者森の満徳長者は、卜部保昌といい、出家して保昌坊と称した。彼は、紀伊国の熊野の霊所に詣でて上洛し、仏師定朝に観音三十三体を造らせ、教円阿闍梨の開眼供養をうけて帰り、秋田三十三観音札所を草創した。また、平鹿、山北、雄勝の各郡に吉沢・杉沢の流れを用水としてひき、百姓に田畑を多く耕作させて、大きな屋敷に住み、蔵を数えきれないほどもち、牛馬、犬、鶏も多数飼って富み栄えた。その系譜をたどれば地福長者もその一族であり、それぞれ、清原光頼・清原武則と血縁関係にある。
という満徳長者・地福長者の伝説の記載がある。

歴史的背景
明永・明保長者による「鳥の海の干拓」と満徳・地福長者の伝説は、ともに鎌倉時代以降に成立した伝承と考えられるが、いずれも古い時代の横手盆地の開発を物語ると考えられる。丘陵を切り開いて湖水を流し出して干拓するという明永・明保長者の人智・人力を超越するような働きは、言い換えれば、膨大な数の民衆を駆使して大がかりな土木工事をとりおこない、用排水を大々的に整備して、低湿地をどんどん耕地に変えていった開発領主の姿である。ここに、御嶽・副川などの式内社に出てくる神が登場しているのは、横手盆地の開発が、これらの信仰と固く結びついて展開されたであろうことを示唆している。
満徳・地福長者の伝承については、それぞれが富貴をあらわす縁起のよい名がつけられており、11世紀から12世紀にかけて全国各地でみられる伝説と共通点が多い(ただし、それだけで伝承の成立年代まで結論づけることはできない)。この2人の長者もまた、多数の百姓をかかえる開発領主であるが、ここでも御嶽信仰、熊野信仰が結びついており、中央、地方にまたがる由緒づけがなされている。特に長者の系譜に出羽清原氏が登場している点が注目される。ここで『陸奥話記』の前九年合戦における清原軍の陣立てなどをみると、清原氏が各地の領主層と思われる吉彦(吉美侯)氏や橘氏を組織し、陸奥側の安倍氏に匹敵もしくは凌駕する軍勢の動員力を有している点から見て、「長者」と清原氏の間に何らかの関係があったと考えても決して不自然ではない。
いずれにせよ、この2つの伝説は、古代末期から中世初頭にかけての辺境における農地開発や在地権力の形成の様相の一端を示すものではないかと考えられるのである。

備考
この伝説は、日本のテレビアニメ『まんが日本昔ばなし』でも取り上げられた(1990年3月17日放映『鳥の海の開拓』)

概要
全高203センチメートルの伊豆石製で、塔身や基礎の部分は典型的な「関東形式」の特徴を持つ。塔の背後にやぐらがあり、中には朽ちて一部しか残っていないものも含めて14基の五輪塔が建つ。
泣塔は、非常に形が整っていること、隅飾や基壇部の四隅にある凸部の形状が珍しいこと、基壇部に刻まれた銘が明瞭に残っていることなどの特徴があるため、「重要美術品等ノ保存ニ関スル法律」に基づき、1933年（昭和8年）8月23日付け「深沢文和五年銘宝篋印塔」名義で重要美術品に認定された。同法は1950年（昭和25年）8月29日に文化財保護法が施行されたことを受けて廃止されたが、同法によって認定された物件の認定効力は、文化財保護法附則の規定によって継続している。加えて1971年（昭和46年）9月11日には「石造 宝篋印塔（文和五年銘）」名義（所有者：鎌倉市）で鎌倉市指定有形文化財となった。
現在、2019年夏の豪雨でヤグラの崖が崩れ、安全の為、フェンス内の立ち入りはできない。

名称の由来
「泣塔」という名前の由来について詳しいことは分かっていないが、塔の後ろのやぐらが風に反響して泣き声のような音を出すことから「泣き塔」と名づけられたという説や、「無き人（無縁仏の意）の塔」が訛ったとする説がある。また、一時、石塔を近隣の青蓮寺に移したところ、夜な夜なすすり泣く声が聞こえたことから「泣塔」と呼ばれるようになったという伝承もある。ただし、移設されたとする青蓮寺に記録が残っていないため、移設の事実なども含めて詳細は不明である。

歴史
1933年（昭和8年）に調査を行った際、基壇部に以下のとおりの銘文が発見された。

このことから、南北朝時代中期にあたる文和5年2月20日（ユリウス暦換算:1356年3月22日）に造立されたものと推測される。塔の正式な由緒は不明であるが、鎌倉時代末の元弘3年5月（ユリウス暦換算:1333年6月頃）に新田義貞軍が鎌倉を攻めた際の一局面である洲崎合戦（cf. 鎌倉の戦い#小袋坂(巨福呂坂)）の古戦場（洲崎古戦場）が付近にあること、および、塔の背後に櫓があることから、櫓に葬られた戦死者を周辺住民が弔うために造立した塔と見られている。銘文のとおりであれば、二十三回忌の追善法要の際に建てられたことになる。
造立されてのちの塔の歴史についてもまた、ほとんど何も分かっていない。しかし、いつの頃からか、泣塔にまつわる不吉な言い伝えが流布されるようになった。泣塔が建つ土地を所有した者は貧乏になる、泣塔を目にした者は後日幽霊と出遭う、祟りを受ける、などといった類いのものであるが、これらの言い伝えは泣塔周辺を開発から取り残すほどの影響力を持っていた。
1943年（昭和18年）、周辺の土地が大日本帝国海軍に買い上げられ、横須賀海軍工廠深沢分工場が造営されることになったが、その際、泣塔周辺（陣出）も建設予定地に含まれており、泣塔は周りの丘ごと削平される予定であった。しかし、古くからの言い伝えを知る周辺住民はこれを思い留まるよう要望した。また、塔の撤去作業中にたびたび怪我人が出たことや、付近の工事現場で死者5名を数える事故が起きたこと、夜中に異様な音が聞こえるなど、凶事・変事が様々に起きたことから、ついには当局も泣塔の破却を断念し、この一角（陣出）だけは手を着けることなく建設予定地の脇にて旧態地形のまま保存され、周辺住民によって供養され続けることとなった。翻れば、周辺にあった他の古戦場由来地はほとんどがこの時期に削平されてしまって現存しない。
第二次世界大戦後、横須賀海軍工廠深沢分工場の敷地は、1949年（昭和24年）6月1日に発足した日本国有鉄道（国鉄）に払い下げられ、車両整備工場として再整備されたが、この際も泣塔については保存の方針が引き継がれ、毎年の創立記念日には供養が行われた。また、1966年（昭和41年）12月1日には、時の工場長の発案で、泣塔の周辺に杉の苗400本が植えられた。

概要
宮城県名取市上余田には戦いで降参した一族が鎧（よろい）や武器を埋めたと言われる七つの塚があり「七島」と呼ばれている。水田耕作や国道国道4号バイパス工事、宅地開発等で姿を消したが、七つの塚の西端に観音様が祀られ「七島観音」と言われている。周辺地域には、たしかにアベを名乗る一族が現在でも住んでいるが、直接的なつながりはこれからの調査いかんにより判明する可能性もある。

伝説
その昔、源義家が安倍貞任を攻めたとき、樽水の大館より射た矢が上余田まで飛んで来て突き刺さった所を「矢塚」と呼び、矢が飛び越えた橋を「矢越の橋」と云ったという。
そこには合戦で義家に降伏した安倍氏の一族が鎧や武器などを埋めた七ツの塚があり「七島」と云われたという。上余田の七島集落裏の水田の中に15メートル程の間隔で、七基の塚が東西に並んでいる。昔は円い塚だったが水田の耕作で次第に削られて、痩せた紡錘形になったのだという。　
七ツの塚は戦後まで存在したが、国道4号のバイパス工事で二基が姿を消し、その後一基が住宅建設で崩壊したと里人が話す。七ツの塚の西端の塚に観音様が祀られ「七島観音」といわれていた。
2020年現在、周辺一体は宅地開発が行われ残りの塚も消滅してしまったが、数年前に名取市教育委員会が七島の発掘調査を行った。その結果は伝説の鎧や武器を埋蔵した跡は認められなかったが、古墳時代末期頃の円墳と考えられる遺跡が発掘された。
名取郡内には「前九年の役」や「後三年の役」で戦場になったとする伝説の場所が数多く残っているが、上余田の七島は前九年の役や後三年の役とは関係がなさそうである。p91「矢越の橋と七島の伝説」p91

概要
1859年（安政6年）2月、江戸山谷の真崎稲荷（現・東京都荒川区南千住の石浜神社）で山谷の若者と穢多の若者が衝突し、穢多が一人殺された。
そこで穢多頭の弾左衛門は下手人の処刑を北町奉行（当時この地位にあったのは石谷穆清）に願い出た。すると奉行は「およそ穢多の身分は平民に比して七分の一に相当するから、今六人の穢多を殺して後、相当の処刑をなすべし」と宣告した。
これは名裁きとされ、弾左衛門も泣き寝入りした、というのが伝説のあらましである。喜田貞吉は「何ら標準のない乱暴なこの比量にも屈服しなければならなかった彼らの境遇の、憐れむべかりしは言うまでもないが、これを以て名裁判だなどと歓迎した当時の状態も、また憐れまずにはおられない」と評している。

歴史的評価
しかし本田豊はこのような史実があったこと自体を疑い、と述べている。にもかかわらず、この伝説は史実と喧伝され、部落差別の深刻さをアピールするための教材としてたびたび同和団体に利用されている。同和教育の教材として学校でも利用され、大阪府の解放教育読本『にんげん』にも収録されていた。

概要
琉球王国時代に八重山列島の諸事を王府に報告した文書である『八重山島年来記』には、1648年に波照間島平田村の農民40～50人が重税から逃れるために大波照間に渡ったという記述が残っている。また、波照間島には、ヤグ村のアカマリという男が、税を取り立てに来た役人の船を奪い、村人を連れて南波照間島に向かったとの伝承がある。
波照間島を含む八重山列島では、琉球王国時代の1637年から1903年までの間、人頭税という過酷な税が課されており、『八重山島年来記』が伝える年代はこの課税の期間と整合する。
伝承としてみる場合には、南波照間島は琉球列島に伝わるニライカナイ伝説の一類型と考えられる。また、実在の確かでない地への渡航には、那智浜から浄土を目指して船出する補陀落渡海との共通性が見いだせる。
南波照間島が想像上の島であるのか実在する島であるのか、実在する島であるとすればどの島のことであるのかは明らかでない。また、『八重山島年来記』に記された伝承が事実であるのか、事実であるとすれば、島民達は実在する島を目指したのか、伝説上の未知の島を目指したのか、そしてその島に着くことができたのかのかも不明である。南波照間島が実在する島であるとの説を採る場合、その比定地には、台湾、台湾南東沖の緑島（火焼島）や蘭嶼島（紅頭嶼）、フィリピンのルソン島等の諸説がある。
1892年（明治25年）、沖縄県知事は未調査であった沖大東島（ラサ島）及び南波照間島の探索を海軍省に要請し、派遣された軍艦海門は大東諸島を探索した。しかし、同艦の艦長は所在不明な島を探検する手段はなく、本省からの命令もないとして南波照間島の探索を断った、と笹森儀助は『南嶋探験』に記している。1906年（明治39年）頃には、沖縄県の技手らが、南波照間島に擬せられた緑島（火焼島）及び蘭嶼島（紅頭嶼）を2度に渡り探索しようとしたが、上陸を果たせなかったという。

概要
山城の落城を語る伝説で、籠城戦で敵に包囲されて水を断たれた時に、城にはまだ水が豊富にあると攻め手を欺瞞するため、兵糧の白米を水に見立てたというもの。攻撃側から見えるように白米を流し落として滝に見せたり、馬を白米で洗う光景を見せたりした。
結末としては、鳥が白米をついばんだり、内通者が密告したりして欺瞞が露呈する場合が殆どである。しかし、欺瞞が成功して、水源遮断の効果がないと判断した攻め手が包囲を解くパターンもある。

起源
この伝説のある場所から焼き米が出土する場合があり、事実と信じられることもあるが、語り物などにより全国各地に伝播された話であり史実ではないと見られている。柳田國男は、口寄せたちにより創作された物語と推測した。
また、中国（呉）の伍子胥が、土を盛った上に薄く米で覆って米の山があるように見せかけたという「兵糧塚伝説」が起源だとする説もある。この説によると、この兵糧塚伝説が朝鮮に伝わって「洗馬台伝説」（文禄の役で加藤清正に攻められた権慄が、山上で馬を白米で洗うことで敵を欺いたという伝説）となり、百済系の渡来人を通じて日本に入ってきたと考えられている。

分布
北海道南東部を除く日本各地に広く分布しており、特に地方の軍記物に記録されている例が多い。

概説
日本をはじめ、世界各地に同じような伝説が伝えられている。共通点として、基本的な登場人物に「羽衣によって天から降りてきた天女（てんにょ）」「その天女を我がものとする男」の2人が挙げられる。同様の伝承は世界各地に残り、発祥はインドのプルーラブアス王の説話であるとする説もある。アールネ・トンプソン・ウターの分類による「国際民話話型ATU」の413番、「盗まれた服」（旧「服を盗むことによる結婚」）にあたるタイプの民話である。

ストーリー
水源地（海岸・湖水）に白鳥が降りて水浴びし、人間の女性（以下天女）の姿を現す。
天女が水浴びをしている間に、天女の美しさに心を奪われたその様子を覗き見る存在（男、老人）が、天女を天に帰すまいとして、その衣服（羽衣）を隠してしまう。
衣類を失った1人の天女が飛びあがれなくなる（天に帰れなくなる）
日本の羽衣伝説では、ここから近江型と丹後型でわかれる。
近江型（昇天型）
天に帰れなくなった天女は男と結婚し子供を残す（幸をもたらす）。
天女は羽衣を見つけて天上へ戻る
後日談（後述）
丹後型（難題型）
天に帰れなくなった天女は、老夫婦の子として引き取られる
天女は酒造りにたけ、老夫婦は裕福となる
老夫婦は自分の子ではないと言って追い出す
天女はさまよった末ある地に留まる（トヨウケビメ）

類型
羽衣の隠し場所
穀物の貯蔵場所 :蔵、おひつ、ワラ束の中、カマド、ナガモチ
植物の植えてある場所 :畑の中、花の中、藪の中
珍しい所では、大黒柱の中というものもある。これらの隠し場所は、天女に豊穣霊あるいは穀霊としての側面があった為と考えられる。
後日談
地域によりかなりの差異が認められる。幾つかのパターンを記す。

昇天型：羽衣を見つけた天女が、夫を捨てて天にかえってしまう。子供を一緒に連れて行く場合もある。
難題型：山間部に多い。天女の父が難題を出す七夕伝説に連続する。焼畑農耕地帯との関連が指摘されている。
七星型：北斗七星のうちの1つのぼんやりしたものを泣き暮れている天女に設定する。
日本では沖縄県（北限奄美大島）にのみ存在。
世界的には東南アジア、中国南部などに存在する。
再会型：九州地方に多い。稲作農耕地帯との関連も考えられている。
夫と相思相愛になった天女が、天の父に夫を認めてもらうため、夫を助ける。
天に帰れなくなった天女は男と結婚し子供を残す（幸をもたらす）。
ところが、その後の経緯を特定しないケースもあり、男は舞を見たいと所望するが夫婦にはならず、その場で天女に羽衣を渡してしまう。
天女を祖先神とする説話の型では、千葉県千葉市に伝わる羽衣伝説は千葉氏の出自（さらに千葉の由来）を述べる。余呉に伝わる別の羽衣伝説では菅原道真の、沖縄県宜野湾市森の川の飛衣（とびんす＝羽衣）伝説では察度王の出自について語られている。鳥取県湯梨浜町と倉吉市に伝わる羽衣伝説では羽衣石城主・南条氏の出自のほか、打吹山や倉吉の地名の由来についても語られている。

日本の羽衣伝説
近江国
『帝王編年紀』養老7年/723年の条の文（『近江国風土記』逸文とされる）に伝わる、滋賀県長浜市余呉湖 にまつわる羽衣伝説。「昇天型」とされる。

丹後国
『丹後国風土記』によれば、丹後国丹波郡の比治の里の比治山の「真奈井」という井（泉）に、八人の天女が水浴びしていたところ、そのうちの一人の老翁が羽衣を隠して帰られなくし、これを強いて養子にとった。後世だが、坂士仏『大神宮参詣記』にも丹後国の川辺の逸話として言及される。
この「比治山」は磯砂山、場所は京都府京丹後市峰山町に比定される。当例は羽衣伝説の「難題型」に分類される。

各地の羽衣伝説
上記のほか、日本各地に類似の伝承が残る。

千葉県佐倉市 - 昇天型
千葉県千葉市（羽衣の松） - 昇天型
千葉県君津市浦田（『久留里記』細田妙見天女の伝説）
静岡県静岡市清水区三保の松原 （『本朝事蹟考』、『神社考』等）- 昇天型
大阪府交野市天野川流域（『河内国名所図会』天川の羽衣伝説）
鳥取県東伯郡湯梨浜町羽衣石 - 昇天型
鳥取県倉吉市仲ノ町 - 昇天型
沖縄県宜野湾市真志喜
羽衣伝説はないが、福島県伊達郡川俣町には絹の里となるに至った小手姫伝説があり、天女の羽衣のような世界一薄い絹織物「フェアリー・フェザー」で知られる。また、大阪府高石市羽衣には、浜寺公園にあった名松のひとつ「羽衣の松」にちなんだ羽衣駅が開業し、旧称の今在家から羽衣と改称した経緯がある。

ユーラシア大陸の羽衣伝説
朝鮮
江原道金剛山にまつわる伝承である。貧しくも誠実な樵が猟師に追われた1匹の獐（あるいは鹿）を憐れみ匿ったところ、返礼として、天女を妻とするために沐浴の間に衣服を隠すことを教わり、その通りにする。衣を失って飛べなくなった天女はやむをえず男の妻となり複数の子を儲けるが、やがて衣を取り戻して天に帰る。その後の展開には、日本の羽衣伝説同様、いくつかの系統がある。
中国
『捜神記』によれば、豫洲新喩県の男が田に6～7人の女を見つけ、隠れて近づき、脱いでおかれていた衣を1枚隠す。男が姿を見せると女たちは鳥となって飛び去るが、衣を失った1羽は飛び立つことができない。男はそれを捕らえて妻とし、3人の娘を生ませるが、やがて女は娘から父に衣の隠し場所を聞き出させて取り戻し、娘たちを連れて去る。『玄中記』に残る姑獲鳥伝説にも同様の展開がみられる。
ベトナム
樵の男が人の気配のない泉で沐浴する数人の仙女を見つけ、1人の着物を米蔵の底に隠し、仙女を己の妻とする。数年は睦まじく暮らすが、息子が3歳になったある日、夫の不在時に米を売った仙女は着物を見つけ、自らの櫛を息子の襟に付けて去る。男は帰宅後に事情を知り、息子を連れて泉に向かい、息子が水に櫛を沈める。仙女は2人を認めて共に暮らすことになるが、仙女の召使の不注意により父と子は海で溺死し、仙女は召使を罰して明けの明星に変えてしまう。他説では、仙女自身が明けの明星となり、父と子は宵の明星になって、互いに捜しあっているが二度と会うことはできない、とする。
インドネシア
インドネシアの中央セレベスには、天女が蟹や鸚鵡、鳩の姿をとる羽衣伝説が伝わる。また、ジャワ島には「羽衣天女」と「鶴の恩返し」双方の要素をもつ伝承が伝わる。そのほかボルネオ、ハルマヘラ島等、各地に羽衣天女（羽衣伝説）と同様の展開をする説話が伝わっている。
フランス
「作者不詳の『グラアランの短詩』の主人公グラアランは、森の中で真っ白な雌鹿を見かける。その雌鹿が彼の眼前に飛び出してきたので呼びかけたが、雌鹿は離れていく。彼は馬で雌鹿の後を追うが追いつけず、広野にある泉へと導かれる。泉では1人の乙女が水浴びをしていて、2人の別の乙女がそのほとりにいた。水浴びしている乙女の衣服は、草叢の中に置かれていた。グラアランはその衣服を奪い、娘を無理やり引き留めようと考えた。その後、グラアランはこの娘を妻に迎える［後にグラアランは宮廷で皆が王妃の美貌を称える中、王妃よりも美しい女性が見つけられると断言する。これにより、2人の恋を誰にも明かさないという妻との約束を破る。妻を失ったグラアランは、王妃を侮辱した罪で判決を待つ身となったが、判決の日に妻が現れて無罪放免となる］。そして妻は馬で森に向かい、川へ入っていく。後を追ったグラアランが川で溺れそうになると、妻は彼を一緒に自国へ連れ帰ったという」。
同様の伝承は、メラネシアのニュー・ヘブライデス島や、モンゴル、シベリア、アイヌ人の神話にもみられる。

北米・南米の羽衣伝説
カナダのアルゴンキン族の神話、南米ガイアナのアラワク族の神話に、羽衣神話と同種の伝承が残る。

概要
八の太郎大蛇伝説とは、青森県十和田湖に住んでいた大蛇が、その後秋田県の田沢湖ないし八郎潟の主になったという伝説である。地域によって伝説の内容に違いはあるが、ここではその一つを紹介する。
現在の八戸市十日市に住んでいたお藤という娘と、同市の八太郎沼に住んでいた大蛇の間に子供が産まれ、八の太郎と名づけられた。やがて、青年になった八の太郎は、シナの木の皮を剥ぎに仲間と行ったが、途中で谷川で捕まえたイワナを三匹食べてなぜか異常に喉が渇いて堰きとめた川の水を飲み続けた。すると大蛇になってしまい、その後谷間に水を溜めて十和田湖を創りその主となった、という伝説。
その他にも、八の太郎は現在の八戸市島守地区から出たという伝説もある。
また、十和田湖の主となる前に、現在の八戸市是川を流れる新田川を堰き止めようとして、あと一回だけ籠で土を運べば堰が完成するはずだったのに、虚空蔵様が鳥になって夜明けを告げてしまった。そのせいで、八戸市十日市に逃げたとき犬に吠えられたため鳥屋部岳に逃げて、そこの岩をちぎって犬に投げた。その石が十日市にあるという伝説も残されている。
別名十和田湖伝説、または南祖坊とも言われている。
八戸市ではこのほか、八戸太郎伝説、義経伝説、藤五郎狐伝説、千代狐伝説、狐の嫁入り伝説、大木憑霊伝説、メドツ（カッパ）伝説が知られる。

美女池は静御前伝説の残るところである。源義経の奥州下りの跡を慕い、従者小六、乳母のさいはらとともにこの地までやって来た静御前が、小六の死と平泉までのあまりに遠い道のりへの落胆から、乳母のさいはらと共にこの池に身を投じたとされている。それにちなんで毎年3月28日、郡山市では御霊を祀る「静御前堂」で例大祭を行なっている。この御堂も800年の歴史を持ち、現在の御堂は江戸時代の1783年（天明三）に再々建されたもの。境内には静御前の供をして同じくこの地で果てた二人の従者「乳母さいはら」と「小六の碑」も祀られている。従者の碑があるのは全国でも珍しいとされる。

概要
姫島は、『古事記』等に記された「国産み」神話で、伊邪那岐（イザナギ）・伊邪那美（イザナミ）の2神が、大八島の後に続けて産んだとされる6つの島のうち、4番目に産んだ女島であるとされる。また、『日本書紀』では、垂仁天皇の時代に、意富加羅国（おほからのくに。現在の韓国南部にあったと考えられている。）の王子の都怒我阿羅斯等（つぬがあらしと）が、白石から生まれた童女に求婚すると、美女は消え失せ、都怒我阿羅斯等が追いかけると日本に渡り、摂津及び姫島に至って比売語曽（ひめこそ）社の神となったとされる（姫島には比売語曽社が、また、大阪府東成区には比売許曽神社がそれぞれ現存している）。
姫島はこのように古代からの伝承に富んだ島であり、様々な伝承が島内の場所や事物に関連づけて語り継がれて生きた。そのうちの代表的なものが姫島七不思議であり、七不思議のうちの3つは比売語曽神にちなむものである。
江戸時代後期の文政・天保の頃（19世紀はじめ）に活躍した戯作者柳亭種彦が、姫島七不思議を読んだ短歌5首が残っていることから、姫島七不思議は遅くともこの頃には成立していたものと考えられる。島には柳亭種彦の短歌を刻んだ歌碑が建てられている。
姫島七不思議のうちの浮洲及び千人堂は、水産庁が2006年2月17日に発表した未来に残したい漁業漁村の歴史文化財産百選に選ばれている。

姫島七不思議の一覧
浮洲
浮洲（うきす）は、姫島の沖合にある小さな洲で、漁業の神として島の漁師の信仰を集める高倍様（たかべさま）が祀られている。高部様やその鳥居は、高潮や大時化に遭っても海水に浸かることがなく、この洲が海中に浮いているようであることから、浮洲と名付けられた。

千人堂
千人堂（せんにんどう）は、島でも屈指の景勝地である観音崎にある小さなお堂で、1寸2分の黄金の馬頭観音像が祀られている。大晦日の晩に債鬼（借金取り）に追われた島民千人を匿ったとの伝説があり、大晦日の晩に千人堂に詣ると借金取りから逃れられると言い伝えられている。
千人堂は、山立て（陸上の特徴のある地点を目印として複数定め、それを頼りにして海上での船の位置を定める方法）で漁場で決める際の目印としても利用されている。
千人堂の下の断崖には、灰白色の黒曜石の層が露出している。この特徴ある灰色の黒曜石を材料とした石器は、中国地方や四国地方でも発掘されており、古代における交易の広がりを示している。姫島の黒曜石産地は2007年7月26日に国の天然記念物に指定されている。

逆柳
逆柳（さかさやなぎ）は、比売語曽姫が使った柳の楊枝を土中に逆さまに挿すと、そこから生えた柳であり、そのため枝が垂れていないと伝えられる。

かねつけ石
かねつけ石（かねつけいし）は、別名をおはぐろ石ともいう。比売語曽姫がお歯黒をつけた場所であり、この石に猪口と筆を置いた跡が窪みになって残っているという。

浮田
浮田（うきた）は、昔は大蛇の夫婦が住んでいた池で、誤って大蛇もろとも池を埋め立てて田にしてしまったために、大蛇の怒りで田が浮いているように揺れるという。

阿弥陀牡蠣
阿弥陀牡蠣（あみだかき）は、島の東端にある姫島灯台の断崖下の船でしか行けない海蝕洞窟に群生するカキで、阿弥陀如来（一説には阿弥陀如来の耳）に似た形をしていることからこの名が付けられた。海水に浸かることがない高さに群生していて、食べると腹痛を起こすという。

拍子水
拍子水（ひょうしみず）は、別名をおはぐろ水ともいい、比売語曽姫がお歯黒をつけた後に口をすすぐ水がなかったので、手拍子を打って祈ったところ、岩の間から湧き出してきた水であると伝えられる。炭酸水素冷鉱泉で、現在は、この鉱泉を利用した健康管理センターが設けられて拍子水温泉と称しており、湧き出したままの23.6℃の冷泉とこれを沸かした湯に入ることができる。

歴史
舞楽に登場する「二の舞」に登場する滑稽な役を演ずる役の面が神楽へ移行したものが、滑稽な道化役としてのひょっとこの登場の始まりだと考えられている里神楽（さとかぐら）では、一連の番数の神楽のほかに番外として舞われる「もどき」と称される踊りにひょっとこの面をつけた踊りが舞われた。
ひょっとこの面の造型自体は、猿楽などで使用されていた「黒尉」の面などに由来している。同種の面は「うそぶき」と呼ばれ、目はまるく、口をとがらせて突き出た形につくられている。現代まで見られるひょっとこの面の祖型が出来あがりはじめたのは室町時代であると見られており、江戸時代に里神楽・町神楽などを通じて一般的になっていったとされる。

昔話
岩手県に伝わる昔話には以下のようなものがあり、『江刺郡昔話』（佐々木喜善・編、1922年）などで報告されている。

その子の名前が「ひょうとく」であったことから、「ひょっとこ」という名称が生まれたとされている。東北地方には同様の類話が昔話として多く確認されており、登場する子供の名称が異なっていることがある（うんとく、したりなど）が、おおむねその後身が火神（かまど神）となったとされており、「ひょっとこ」と火が関係があるという民間語源に近い解説例として、よく採り上げられている。うんとく、したり、ひょうとくなどの登場する昔話は、竈の神として最終的にまつられる箇所以外は、『竜宮童子』などに分類される昔話と似た構造になっている。
また、前沢町（岩手県胆沢郡）では、お爺さんが山で腹痛を起こして苦しんでいた顔のめぐさい（みにくい）若者を助けて家に連れ帰ったところ、恩返しのために働いてくれた際、みにくくとがった口を火吹き竹のように使ってとても上手に台所の煮炊きの火を起こしてくれた。その若者がいる間は家はとても栄えたが、婆さんが次第に若者をうとんじるようになり、追い出したところ、家はたちまち衰微してしまった。という話も採集されている。この話ではひょっとこの始まりにあたる存在が子供ではなく若者になっているが、若者が「竈の近くに自分の顔に似せた面を飾っておけば良い」と後に爺さんに告げる結末があり、形式は同じである。

文学作品および伝統芸能に登場するひょっとこ
ひょっとこの登場する作品を列挙することは枚挙に暇がないが、時代や各文芸におけるひょっとこの変遷を考えるうえで役立ちそうなものとして紹介する。

芥川龍之介が『ひょっとこ』という題名の小説を書いている。
須藤鐘一の小説『奇怪な肖像画』中、友吉という登場人物の容貌の表現に「ヒョットコ面（づら）」というのが見られる。
太宰治の著作『おしゃれ童子』中、演劇中の鳶職が「ひょっとこめ!」と台詞を吐くことに憧れ紺の股引が欲しかったという記載がある。
古典落語 『厩火事』中に「ひょっとこめ!」と相手を揶揄する台詞がある。
レーヴィ・マデトヤの作曲によるバレエ音楽 『オコン・フオコ』は日本を舞台にした作品で、題名は「おかめ・ひょっとこ」が由来ともされる。

ひょっとこの登場する祭
面をつけ滑稽な踊りをすることは現代の各地の神楽や祭りでも見ることができる。
茨城県の桜川市久原では祭礼として「ひょっとこ」と呼ばれる滑稽な踊り・寸劇が行われていた。ひょっとこ囃子で踊ることからそのように呼ばれており、地芝居あるいは歌舞伎の茶番狂言などが素地になっていると考えられている。
福島県にあるデコ屋敷周辺では張り子で作られたひょっとこの面で踊る「高柴ひょっとこ踊り」が300年ほど前から伝えられ、郡山市内の愛好会による踊りが郡山うねめまつりなどで披露される。
大規模にひょっとこを取り上げたものには、宮崎県日向市で開催されている「日向ひょっとこ夏祭り」がある。祭り自体は1984年（昭和59年）に始まった新しいものではあるが、毎年数万の観客を集め、2000人以上の踊り手が市内を練り歩く、同市最大かつ宮崎県を代表するお祭りである。この祭りで踊られる腰を前後にグラインドさせて痙攣する動きが特徴的な「永田のひょっとこ踊り」は明治期に日向市塩見永田地区で眼科医を開業していた医師・橘公行が里神楽を元に考案したとされ、現在は地元の橘ひょっとこ踊り保存会によって引き継がれている。
島根県の民謡「安来節」にもひょっとこ顔の男踊りとして、「ドジョウ掬い踊り」がある。出雲国（島根県）はかつて製鉄が盛んであり、その砂鉄採取が所作の源流とされ、炎と関係の深い金属精錬神への奉納踊りの側面もあったとも考えられている。

空調用ダクトのひょっとこ
冷暖房に使用するダクトの部材において、主管から分岐する場合に抵抗を減らすために風の流れる方向に広がった台形状の取り出し管のことを「ひょっとこ」と呼称する。吹き出し口に取り出す場合に、天井開口から作業できるように、内側から折り倒せるように加工した取り出し管を「内ひょっとこ」と呼称する。ともに取り出し部分にあたる鉄板がひょっとこの面の口のように飛び出していることからの呼称である。

伝説の概要
様々な説があるが、中でも『太平記』第一六巻「日本朝敵事」の記事が最も有名。
『太平記』によると、天智天皇の時代、時の豪族藤原千方は、四人の鬼を従えていた。どんな武器も弾き返してしまう堅い体を持つ金鬼（きんき）、強風を繰り出して敵を吹き飛ばす風鬼（ふうき）、如何なる場所でも洪水を起こして敵を溺れさせる水鬼（すいき）、気配を消して敵に奇襲をかける隠形鬼（おんぎょうき。「怨京鬼」と書くことも）である。藤原千方はこの四鬼を使って朝廷に反乱を起こすが、藤原千方を討伐しに来た紀朝雄（きのともお）の和歌により、四鬼は退散してしまう。こうして藤原千方は滅ぼされる事になる。
他の伝承では、水鬼と隠形鬼が土鬼（どき）、火鬼（かき）に入れ替わっている物もある。
また、この四鬼は忍者の原型であるともされる。

坂上田村麻呂伝説
藤原千方の四鬼は坂上田村麻呂伝説にも登場する。

岩手山
『奥州南部岩手郡切山ヶ嶽乃由来』では、奥州達谷窟の岩屋に住む悪郎と高丸兄弟が苅田丸と田村丸親子を討って帝位に就き、先祖である藤原千方の無念を晴らそうと風鬼・水鬼・火鬼・隠形鬼も加えて謀議を企てていた。都に上った水鬼と隠形鬼は官女に化けて花見の宴に紛れて帝に近付いたが、田村丸に見破られて水鬼は討たれ、隠形鬼は逃げ帰った。勅命を蒙った田村丸は5万8千余騎を率いて奥州へと攻める。田村丸の弟・千歳君は城中深く攻め込み隠形鬼に囚われたが、山伏姿であらわれた秋葉山大権現が千歳君を救いだし、虚空より大磐石をふらせ、大地より火焔を湧き出させて殲滅させた。

熊野
三重県南牟婁郡御浜町尾呂志に「四鬼の窟」伝説が残る。四鬼の窟と呼ばれる洞窟にはかつて鬼が住んでおり、村の子供をさらっていくので人々は不安であった。熊野鬼ヶ城で鬼の首魁や手下を討伐した田村将軍は尾呂志の鬼退治に甲冑に身を固め、たくましい馬に乗ってやってきた。鬼どもと田村将軍の合戦の末、鬼を退治した将軍が窟に入ると一人の子供が藤蔓で縛られていた。

ここでは「藤原利仁伝説」も記述する。

概要
モデルとなった人物は鎮守府将軍・藤原利仁（ふじわら の としひと）とされ、利仁にまつわる数々の伝説が大納言・坂上田村麻呂へと引き寄せられる形で御伽草子『鈴鹿の草子（田村の草子）』などの田村文芸に継承されたことで伝説上の人物としての藤原俊仁が誕生した。
室町時代の御伽草子では「としひと」の名前は田村丸俊宗の父・藤原俊仁（もしくは田村俊仁）として田村麻呂と親子関係で登場するが、それらを底本として江戸時代に成立した奥浄瑠璃『田村三代記』では藤原俊仁の物語上の役割が田村利光（たむら の としみつ）という人物名で引き継がれたため「としひと」の名前は利光の子・坂上田村丸利仁として継承された。

藤原利仁伝説
平安時代
『今昔物語集』巻14に「心猛クシテ、其ノ道に達セル者ニテ」とあり、文徳天皇の時代に鎮守府将軍の利仁が新羅征討を命じられるも、新羅側はそれを事前に察知して唐の法全阿闍利という「止事無キ聖人」を呼び、唐に留学中だった円珍が調伏をしたため、遠征の途中で利仁は頓死した。末尾には「糸、只人ニモ非ズトナム思ユル」とある。『打聞集』や『古事談』にも『今昔物語集』と同系統の説話が記載されており、新羅征討の説話が成立した院政期には英雄的武人としての利仁の原型が出来上がっていた。利仁による新羅征討の説話は、御伽草子での俊仁将軍による唐土征討の物語の骨格となった。しかし利仁は文徳天皇の時代の人物ではなく、鎮守府将軍は陸奥の防備が仕事であり、利仁の確実な記録が早くに失われたことから作られた説話とされている。『古事談』では宇多天皇の時代の出来事として再録された。
同じく『今昔物語集』巻26では、利仁が五位の者に芋粥を食べさせようと京都から敦賀の舘へ連れ帰った説話も記されており、その人物像は途中で出会った狐さえ服従させるほど威勢のよい豪気の人物であったとして知られている。利仁の祖父・藤原高房は越前守を歴任しており、利仁の母は越前の秦豊国の娘と伝わる。越前国敦賀の豪族・藤原有仁（忌部姓?）の娘婿にもなっていたなど、御伽草子などで俊仁将軍が悪路王の居城へと向かう場面で地獄龍という名前の龍の駒に乗るも、悪路王のいる越前へ向かって飛んだ背景には、利仁と越前敦賀が深い関係にあったことがあげられる。

鎌倉時代
利仁は、坂上田村麻呂・藤原保昌・源頼光とともに中世の伝説的な武人4人組の1人とされていた。鎌倉時代に成立した『平家物語』では、源義仲（木曽義仲）について「田村・利仁・余五将軍（平維茂）・致頼・保昌・頼光・義家とくらべて遜色ない」とされ、歴代名将のはじめに田村麻呂、続けて利仁という並びで置かれている。『保元物語』や『義経記』などの軍記物語にもこれと類似する記述があり、『保元物語』では「古その名聞し田村・利仁が鬼神をせめ、頼光・保昌の魔軍を破りしも、或は勅命をかたどり、或は神力をさきとして、武威の誉を残せり」と、蝦夷征討という史実から離れ、田村麻呂と利仁の伝説が結合して鬼神退治の英雄として記されていく。
『吾妻鏡』では源頼朝が奥州合戦の帰途に立ち寄った田谷窟で、田村麻呂と利仁が悪路王を討伐したと教えられたとある。2人は同じ時代の人物ではなく、悪路王も実在した可能性がほぼないものの、頼朝の段階で利仁が傑出した屈強な武人であったという印象が伝えられていた。御伽草子で藤原俊仁が悪路王を討伐する物語の起源は『吾妻鏡』となる。

室町時代
『義経記』巻第2では、「本朝の武士は坂上田村丸はこれを読み伝えてあくじの高丸（悪事の高丸）を取り、藤原利仁はこれを読みて、赤頭の四郎将軍を取る」と、周の太公望撰とされる六韜という兵法書を読むことで田村麻呂と利仁は名を挙げたと脚色された。幸若舞『未来記』では坂上李人（さかのうえ の りじん）として同一人格であるかのように融合し、李人の子と思われる田村丸が奈良坂のかなつぶてと鈴鹿山の立烏帽子を討伐したと語られ、御伽草子『鈴鹿の草子（田村の草子）』と同系統のあらすじが出来上がっていた。
室町時代の成立とされる『鞍馬蓋寺縁起』は御伽草子の登場人物・藤原俊仁に多大な影響を与えた。鎮守府将軍・藤原利仁が宣旨により、下野国の蔵宗・蔵安を頭目とする群盗討伐に出陣する時、鞍馬山に参籠して退治することに成功した。そこで鞍馬山に毘沙門天像を造顕して開眼供養し、剣を納めたとある。盗賊の蔵宗・蔵安を討伐した説話が、御伽草子などで俊仁将軍が退治した大蛇の倉光・ 喰介へと繋がり、鞍馬山の毘沙門天の加護と給った剣で奥州の悪路王を討つ原点となった。

御伽草子
誕生
俊重将軍の子・俊祐は50歳になっても子供がおらず、心にかなう妻子を求めて上洛すると、あるとき嵯峨野で出会った天女の化身と契りを結ぶ。身籠った妻は3年間胎内に宿したのち、7日間は産屋に近づかないよう言い残した。しかし7日目に約束を破って産屋を覗くと、妻は100尋あまりの大蛇の姿となり、2本の角の間に美しい赤子をのせ、紅色の舌でねぶって遊ばせていた。8日目に産屋から出てきた妻は、約束を破ったのでこの子は日本の主にはならないが、天下の大将軍になる、名を日龍丸（にちりゅうまる）とせよ、自分は益田ヶ池の大蛇であると告げて去った。

大蛇退治
日龍丸は3歳のときに父・俊祐と死別し、7歳のときに御門から近江国見馴川で倉光・ 喰介という2匹の大蛇を退治せよと大事の宣旨が下った。2匹の大蛇は日龍丸の伯父を名乗るが、家宝の角突弓に神通の鏑矢で退治した。大蛇を討って凱旋した日龍丸に将軍の宣旨が下って俊仁将軍と名乗った。

御門の嫉妬
17歳になった俊仁は天下の美女という堀川中納言の娘・照日御前を見初めて契りを結ぶも、それを知った帝が嫉妬して伊豆へ流罪となった。遠流の途中、瀬田の唐橋の上で橋桁を強く踏み鳴らし、見馴川で退治した大蛇の魂魄に向け、都に上がって心のままにせよと呼びかけた。すると都では異変が続き、帝が天文博士に占わせたところ、俊仁将軍を都に戻さなければ異変は鎮まらないという。俊仁は都に帰ることを許され、大蛇は鎮まり、照日御前と再び契りを結んで2人の娘が生まれた。

悪路王討伐
ある時、内裏に参内していると辻風が照日御前を天に吹き上げた。俊仁は嘆いたが、夢に3人の童子が現れて愛宕山へ向かうよう告げられる。さっそく愛宕山に登ると恐惶坊という老僧に迎えられ、帰り道に不思議な事があるだろうと教わった。大きな伏木の橋を渡ると俊仁の母の妹だという大蛇が現れ、妻を拐ったのは陸奥国高山の悪路王という鬼で、鞍馬山の毘沙門天に頼めと告げる。大蛇は成仏できないと言うので1000人の僧で法華経1万部供養で弔った。
鞍馬山に21日間籠った俊仁は毘沙門天から剣を授かり、二条大将の姫君や三条中納言の北の方など、妻子を失った者が他にもいたため、彼らを連れて陸奥国へと出発した。途中、陸奥国初瀬郡田村郷に着いたが、そこで賤女と一夜の契りを交わし、形見として一本の鏑矢を置いて悪路王討伐へと向かった。
悪路王の鉄の居城に向かうと、美濃国より拐われた少女が馬飼の女房として東門を守らされていた。悪路王が留守の間に帰れと言われるも、居城に入る方法を尋ねると、悪路王に飼わされている地獄龍という龍の駒に乗って向かうのだと少女から教わる。さっそく地獄龍に乗ると悪路王のいる越前へと飛んだため、毘沙門天の剣で地獄龍を鎮めて引き返させ、居城にたどり着いた。城門は閉まっていたが、鞍馬の神仏に祈ると門が開き、内側に大勢の女性がいたが、三条北の方と照日御前はいなかった。話を聞くと三条北の方は数日前に鬼の餌食となって首だけが残っていた。大きな桶に人間が鮨に漬けてあり、稚児が串刺しにされ、尼法師の首が数珠のようにつないであり、城の中は地獄のような光景であった。
そこへ空が曇り悪路王が帰ってきたので、鬼達と対峙した俊仁は毘沙門の剣を投げて悪路王や鬼達の首を落とした。拐われた多くの男女と共に照日御前を助けだし、俊仁はみなを連れて都へと帰った。

父子の名乗り
田村郷では一夜の情けを掛けた女性が懐妊し、産まれた男子は臥（ふせり）と名づけられた。臥殿は10歳の時に形見の鏑矢を持って上洛し、俊仁と父子の対面を果たすと名を田村丸と改め、元服して稲瀬五郎坂上俊宗と名乗った。

俊仁の横死
俊仁が55歳のときに唐土を従えようと考え、3000叟の船に50万騎を従えて攻め、渡海した印として神通の鏑矢を天に射ると7日7夜に渡って鳴り響いた。しかし恵果和尚が不動明王と矜羯羅、制多迦を引き連れると、不動明王は金剛童子を日本へと派遣し、自らも日本に渡って「自分を勝たせるなら日本の仏法の守り神となろう」と毘沙門天に誓った。すると俊仁の毘沙門天の剣は光を失って折れ、不動明王の降魔の利剣が俊仁の首を落とした。

奥浄瑠璃版
江戸時代の東北地方で語られた『田村三代記』では、室町時代の『田村の草子』など御伽草子系にはない田村利光による「御狩」が描かれる。『田村三代記』は第一群、第二群、第三群に分類され第一群は悪路王捜索の山狩りが主体となり、中世的説話を色濃く伝え、御伽草子からの古態を残す写本群となる。第二群では第一群にはない「将軍巻狩の段」や「塩竈神社の縁起」などが挿入され、七ツ森での壮大な巻狩が描かれる。どちらも御狩を通して「悪玉との契り」がもたらされる点は共通する。
第二群の御狩には歴史的出来事が反映された。天正19年（1591年）正月9日に奥州仕置を成し遂げた豊臣秀次の軍勢が帰途のおり、七ツ森で御狩をおこなったと『伊達成実記』に記され、近世東北の史実や江戸時代初期の文芸趣向を反映していることがわかる。また慶安3年（1650年）に伊達忠宗が片倉重長と行った蔵王山の巻狩で活躍した片倉良種の姿は、『田村三代記』の御狩で活躍する霞源太を彷彿とさせる。良種の出自は田村丸伝承を携えた田村氏出身である。

この大蛇、女、子供はもとより、人だけでなく家畜まで喰うなど数限りなく悪事を重ね、また農作物を荒らしまわり、人々は嘆き、悲しみの底にうち沈んでいた。しかし、この話が時の天皇であった平城天皇の耳に入り、大蛇の退治を坂上田村麻呂に命じた。将軍田村麻呂は早速この地方に出向き、大蛇退治の準備にとりかかった。まず北向きに五社（沼上、小茂田、新井、十条、古郡の五か村）の大明神を勧請し、また八仏薬師を安置するほか、数多くの神仏に祈念した。特に自分の守りの本尊である大日如来とゆかりのある十二天に登り、霊地を選び、ここに山籠りをして、秘密に僧を招き、37日間、夜の護摩修行をなし、大蛇退治の願いをかけると共に、これより56億8万年の後まで、この山より身馴川の末まで守り給え、との願をかけた。また、小平に入江の様になっている所があり、江の浜と呼ぶ場所に、一本の大きな柳の木があった。将軍はこの柳の木に向かって静止し、「われ願わくば、この地の大蛇を退治して、人々の災難を救い給え、もしこの願いが届くなら、すぐにこの柳に花を咲かせ給え。もし、この願いがかなわなければ、この柳をたちどころに切り倒し、たきぎとしてしまうものなり」と虚空に向かって大声に呼ばわると、ありがたいことか、恐ろしいことか、虚空がにわかに振動して、しばらく暗夜の如くにうち変わり、やがて明るくなると、不思議な事に柳は桜となって、満開の花が咲いた。よって将軍は、この地に虚空蔵菩薩を建立した。柳の木が化して枝垂れ桜となり、現在も栄えているが、柳の大木があった所から地名を「高柳の虚空蔵」と言い、霊験あらたかな霊場となっている。
このようにして、大蛇の住む洞窟に田村麻呂が出向くと、殺気を感じたのか、オスメス二匹の大蛇がものすごい眼光を放ちながら出て来た。驚くことにこの大蛇は、それぞれ二つの頭を持ち、太さ3 m、長さ20 m余りもあった。しばらく将軍達と睨み合いの末、戦いが始まり、一匹を現在の東小平の地に追い詰めたが、田村麻呂に次ぐ勇者椚林小平成身と言う者がこの大蛇の毒気にかかり、遂にこの世を去ってしまった。この事を知った武士達は、この勇者の名をとって椚林と言い、成身院は小平が名乗り、字名を院号とした。やがてメスの方は、田村麻呂の神変通力仏意自在の弓矢によって、射とめられた。一方、オスの大蛇は、川上に身を隠して潜んでいたが、将軍は夜になって舟を出し、大蛇が出て来るのを待った。現在、その場所を待屋と言い、舟をつないで置いた所を船山と呼び伝えられている。夜明けと共に出て来た大蛇は、将軍に追われ、間瀬峠に逃げ延び、峠の頂上から将軍を振り返り、まんじりと見つめた事から、この峠をまんじり峠と呼んだ（後世、間瀬峠と言い伝えるようになる）。こうして児玉の山麓一帯には、平和が訪れた。
将軍が退治した大蛇の骨は百駄あり、この骨を埋めて長泉寺が建立された。よって寺の境内を骨畑と呼び、百駄あった骨にちなんで山号を百駄山と呼ぶようになった。大蛇の住家の風の吹き出た洞穴は埋められ、この地に神を祀って、次来地名を風洞と呼ぶようになったが、その昔は単に洞（あな）と呼んでいたとされる。

その他
児玉の西光寺（児玉氏の菩提寺で、児玉党祖惟行建造）は、この大蛇の両目が日月西に入るように光り輝いていたところから、こう呼ばれる様になったと伝えられている（由来伝承）。
この他にも児玉地域には坂上田村麻呂が大蛇を退治する民話がいくつか伝えられている。ただ、逃げ去った遠峰（こだま）の双頭大蛇のその後については語られていない。遺骨となった大蛇の怨念を沈めた僧の話などはある。
平城天皇の在位期間は806年から809年（9世紀初頭）と短く、設定年代が明確な昔話と言える。
武士と言う身分の形成は10世紀中頃以降ではあるが、『続日本紀』の養老5年（721年・8世紀初め）に「…武士は国家の重みとする所なり」と言う記述があり、言葉自体はあった。遵って、伝承の文法上に矛盾はない。ただし、この時代の武士は朝廷に属する武官と言う意味であり、後世に生じた武士とは異なる。

概説
おとぎ話では、和尚が手放した茶釜（狸の化身で、頭・足・尻尾が生える）が、綱渡りなどの芸をし、これを見世物商売に屑屋が財を築き、茶釜を元の寺（茂林寺）に返還する。
茂林寺は群馬県館林市に実在する寺で、現在も文福茶釜を所蔵する。ただし寺の縁起は、狸の化けた釜とはせず、古狸（貉）の老僧守鶴愛用の「福を分ける」分福茶釜であるとする。千人の僧が集まる法会で茶をたてたが、一昼夜汲み続けても釜の湯はなくならなかったと記される。
狸や狐が茶釜に変化（へんげ）する昔話（民話）は、全国に分布する。人間に恩あるか言いくるめられて茶釜に化け、寺の和尚などに売りつけられるが正体が発覚する、という粗筋の類話群である。狸が芸をする要素（モチーフ）は民話例に少ない。民俗学・民話研究では、狐の恩返し系の動物の報恩譚が原形とされ、よって関敬吾『日本昔話大成』の分類である「文福茶釜」（238B型）と、「狐と博労」型、「狐遊女」型は、大まかに分類すれば同種とみなされている。
江戸時代の赤本では、また違った粗筋の滑稽話になっている。

語源
「分福」という名の由来については諸説ある。この茶釜には八つの功徳があり、「福を分ける茶釜」という意味から分福茶釜と呼ばれるようになったという説明や、沸騰する音の擬声語という説がある。
また「文武火の茶釜」とも表記されるが、文火は弱い火、武火は強い火を指す。同じ語釈は、鳥山石燕の『今昔百鬼拾遺』「茂林寺釜（もりんじのかま）」の添え文でも述べられており、文武火の釜が正しい名であるとしている。

おとぎ話版
巖谷小波のおとぎ話版『文福茶釜』によって広く人口に膾炙したという評もある。その要約は、次のようなものである：
上野国館林の茂林寺で、茶の湯が趣味である和尚さんが茶釜を買って寺に持ち帰る。和尚の居眠り中、茶釜は頭や尻尾、足をはやし、小坊主たちにみつかり騒動となるが最初和尚は信じない。しかし湯を沸かそうと茶釜を炉にかけると、足のはえた正体をあらわす。怪しい釜なので出入りの屑屋に売却。その夜、茶釜はみずから不思議な姿をあらわし、狸の化けた茶釜だと正体をあかし、文福茶釜と名乗る。狸は、寺での扱いをなじり（火にかけられたり、カンカン言わせて叩かれたり）、屑屋には箱にしまうでもなく丁重に養ってもらいたい、そのかわり軽業、踊りの芸を披露する、ともちかける。屑屋は見世物小屋を立ち上げ、茶釜大夫の曲にあわせた綱渡り芸は人気を博す。一財をなした屑屋は満足し、もうけの半分を布施とするとともに茶釜をもとの茂林寺に返還し、同寺の宝となった。
この、茶釜から顔や手足を出した狸の姿や、傘を持って綱渡りをする姿のイメージが、広範にそして甚だしく笑話化されて伝えられてしまっている。
場所（茂林寺）まで指定するのは、これが伝説から純粋な童話になりきっていないひとつの兆候だと志田義秀はしている。

近年での改変
見世物小屋が繁盛した後の結末が二つに分かれる

古道具屋がタヌキを元の姿に戻す方法を模索するが、タヌキは化けたままで居続けた疲れから病にかかり、古道具屋の看病も虚しく元に戻れないまま死んでしまう。悲しんだ古道具屋は茶釜を引き取った寺で和尚さんに全てを話してタヌキを供養してもらい、茶釜は寺の宝として安置される。
タヌキはかつて和尚さんに食べ物を恵んでもらった恩があり、古道具屋が再び寺を訪れた際にその事を思い出した和尚さんと再会を喜んで寺で暮らすことになる。茶釜は毎日お供え物をもらい家宝になる。

寺社伝説
茂林寺につたわる伝説などでは、文福茶釜の持ち主の正体が貉や狸であって、狸が茶釜に変身することはない。

茂林寺縁起
茂林寺の縁起等によると、応永年間の開山より代々の住職に161年仕えた老僧、守鶴が七世の住職月舟正初につかえたおりの千人法会のとき披露した無尽の茶釜が由来であり、その茶釜からいくら湯を汲んでも中の湯がなくならなかったことから、守鶴はその釜を福を分け与える「紫金銅分福茶釜」と命名した、とされる。その後十世の住職の時代、守鶴は貉（または狸）の姿を現してしまい、寺を去った。実際には羅漢の化現であったろうといわれた。
茂林寺に現存する伝・分福茶釜は、紫金銅製、容量1斗2升（21リットル強）、真形（しんなり）の茶釜である。周囲は4尺 (1.2 m)、重量3貫 (11.2 kg)、口径は8寸 (24 cm)で、元の蓋は逸失しており、現在は新たに作られた蓋があてがわれている。

茂林寺の茶釜については館林藩主松平清武の命で作成された享保11年（1726年）2月の什宝書付に以下の記述がある。　一茶釜　世ニ伝フ茂林寺狢ノ茶釜ト云是ナリ、口ノ経リ八寸、腹ノ回リ四尺、金紫銅ノ鋳釜、蓋ハ同銅ニアラス、絃ハ銕也、当寺七世月舟和尚代千人法幢ノ節、衆僧ノ乞ニ随ツテ一夜ノ内ニ持シ来テ常用ニ備フ、然レトモ其来処ヲ語ラスト云茂林寺が開帳の際に発行している「分福茶釜略縁起」はいくつか異本があり、含まれる要素もまちまちである。そのうち古いものは建前上は天正15年（1587年）とあるが、実際は元禄以降の版行ではないかと考察されている。19世紀頃の稿本は、『甲子夜話』巻三十五に所収された縁起と文章がまったく一致する。それらでは、守鶴が茂林寺で経た歳月は120余年となっており、霊鷲山で釈迦の説法を聞いたこともあり、齢は数千年に達し、日本に渡ってきてからも800年が経つとも明かしたとされる。書を能くしたが、書跡はほぼ残らず、直堂の札があるのみという。茶釜の茶で練って丸めた秘薬を守鶴が伝えたとも記される。
また、守鶴の役職は納所（なっしょ）であったということが、「分福茶釜略縁起」にはないが『真書太閤記』等の記述にみつかる。
松浦静山著『甲子夜話』第一、巻三十五にも所収されているが、掲載される（漢籍の）文章は縁起と同じである。

高源寺
茂林寺の史料によれば守鶴は住職を務めてはいなかったが、高源寺（群馬県邑楽郡邑楽町の旧狸塚（むじなづか））の開山・和尚（つまりは住職）であり、狸の正体が発覚した時にこの釜を持って茂林寺に逃げたという言い伝えがあり、このとき蓋を落としていったとされる。
文福茶釜が、もともとは自分の寺にあったという伝承は、高源寺をふくめて群馬県の五つの寺にある。

江戸期の戯作
草双紙の赤本の例は幾つかあるが、似たような内容である。最古は延宝・天和（1680年頃）出版の赤小本『京東山ばけ狐』で、狐の物語である。
近藤清春の画による享保年間の赤本『ぶんぶくちゃがま』はその改作で、（一部の役割が）狐から狸に置き換わっている。あらすじは、京都の東山殿（慈照寺）の茶坊主で、ぶんぶくという名の者が、狐を捕らえて料理しようとする、窮した狐は茶釜に化けるが、火にかけられ「ぶんぶくちゃがまに尾が生えた」などと坊主たちにはやし立てられる。火傷を負った狐は貉に復讐を託す。貉は、事が発覚して裸で追放された四人の坊主たちを見つけ、巨大な陰嚢を広げて覆いかぶせて暖めるが、捕獲されて東山殿（足利義政）に献上される。
鱗形屋が版元の『ぶんぶく茶釜』（刊行年次不詳）も同様の内容で、ただし吸物（つまり狸汁）にされそうになった貉（狸）が自ら報復する話にすり替わっており、近藤清春の作品の改作と目されている。ここでは、茶坊主らがはやし立てる文句は「文福茶釜に毛が生えた」であるが、これは元禄頃から常套句となっているとされる。台詞として浄瑠璃（近松門左衛門作の『双生隅田川』（享保5年（1720年）初演）にも使われており、菊岡沾涼『本朝俗諺志』では釜でなく釜の持ち主に毛が生えたことをさす、と守鶴の伝説につじつまを合わせた説明をしている。

民話
関敬吾（『日本昔話集成』、『日本昔話大成』）では同類の昔話群を「 237B 文福茶釜」に分類している。構成内容は次のようなものである：
ある男が狐（狸）と助けた代償として、あるいは狐（狸）を騙して茶釜になりすまさせ、これを売却して金銭を得る。（売り先はたいがい和尚で、磨かれると茶釜は「痛い」といい、火にかけられると「熱い」といって踊りだす、と英文版では付け加えられている）。のち、茶釜は逃亡するか、もとの男の元に帰り、あるいは踊りの芸で金儲けをさせる。
このうち、小波版のおとぎ話のように、芸で金儲けをさせるモチーフがみられるのはきわめて少数派である。

狸と狐
関は、幾つか各地の民話例を『日本昔話大成』の本格昔話編で掲載している。そのうちくず屋の爺さんと狸の話（長野県下伊那郡の採集話）は、柳田國男により文福茶釜類型の典型例にも選択されている（『日本昔話名彙』）。
酷似するが狐が化ける話が、「化け茶釜」（岩手県紫波郡）である。男が代金として和尚から三両をせしめる、最後に茶釜が山に逃げ出すなどの詳細が両話に共通している。

分類のあいまいさ
文福茶釜の類話群は、「狐遊女」型や「狐と博労」（馬喰）型とはっきり区別しにくく、おおまかにいえば「同種」であると柳田國男は指摘しており、関敬吾も同様のことを述べている（後述）。
それは例えば「狐遊女」のなかには、茶釜、馬、遊女の順に狐が化ける例もあるからである（「狐の報恩」、岩手県『上閉伊郡昔話集』）。柳田の推察では馬に化けるかたちがもっとも古く、次いで茶釜に化けるかたちができたとしている。
関敬吾の場合も、「文福茶釜」、「狐と博労」、「狐遊女」、「三人博労」などは、欧米民話学の「魔術師とその弟子」型（ATU分類 325）にあてはまるとしている。

実践
榎本千賀の論文では「文福茶釜」の伝承として125点の昔話（民話）例を集計しているが、これは広義の意味で動物の茶釜変身譚をすべてカウントするので、「狐と博労」や「狐遊女」の話も含まれている。これらは東北から九州まで広く分布している。

柳田國男のさらなる分析
民俗学者の柳田國男はまた、基話の「狐の恩返し」を基にすれば、動物と人間との交渉（交流）を物語る昔話の根幹には〈動物援助〉の考えがあり、選ばれた人間に神の使いである鳥獣が富を与えるのだという。そこで動物の危機を救ってやり報恩を受けるのを見ると、動物が献身的に尽くす好意も理解できる。動物援助から動物報恩に移行する過渡的な様相を帯びた話といえる。

その他地域の民話例
山形県米沢市南原横堀町の常慶院にも似た類種の伝説が伝わっているが、こちらも狸ではなくキツネが登場する。

規模
帆坂池は面積0.024 km2、堤高11.5 m、堤長150 m、有効貯水量100,000 m3である。

豪雨による被害
帆坂池が一体いつ作られたのか文書記録が残っていないため定かではないものの、17世紀末の浅野藩の時代に作られたのではないかとの口伝が残っている。この付近は瀬戸内式気候で普段は雨が少ない。帆坂池より流れ出してから最終的に赤穂港へと流れ込む大津川も、そして、帆坂峠を挟んで反対側を流れ降る吉井川水系の金剛川も、いずれも普段は水量が乏しく、かつては水利権の争いが起きてきた位である。そのような土地柄なだけに、大雨が降れば災害が発生しやすく、1949年には帆坂池が決壊した。帆坂池が豪雨によって被害を受けたのは何もこれ1回ではなく過去に何回もあったものの、1976年9月の台風でも施設の一部が破損したため、ついでに1970年代末に、今後は被災しにくいように大規模な改修工事が実施された。

民話・伝説
池の水の色に関する民話
帆坂池の水が薄茶色をしている理由は、周囲の山地に風化した花崗岩の粘土質の場所が多いためだろうと推測されている。ただ、この色の理由について、帆坂池の「主」が関係しているとの民話が伝わっている。それによれば、帆坂池の主は、石工が石を割る際に使う大型の鉄のハンマーである「玄能（げんのう）」だとされており、この池の水がいつも薄茶色をして濁っている理由は、玄能の錆が少しずつ溶けてきているからだという。

おろち伝説
さらに帆坂池には、かつて堤の木を伐採したところ、帆坂池が決壊したとの伝説が残っており、これを「おろち伝説」と呼ぶ。このこともあり、帆坂池にはおろち池の別名もある。

周辺施設
帆坂池の畔には地蔵尊と植樹記念碑が建っている。このうち地蔵尊には「寛政15年」と刻まれている。

概要
名前が示すように女の鬼で、伝説では石巻市の牧山に住んでいる鬼だと語られており、箟岳山（ののだけやま。涌谷町に位置する）に住む大嶽丸とは夫婦の間柄であった。妾とも示されていることから、大嶽丸の側室のひとりだとも言える。大嶽丸をはじめとした鬼たちは、大和朝廷から派遣された田村将軍によって退治された。その帰途に田村将軍は魔鬼女の暮らしていた山に観音菩薩を祀り、その像に魔鬼女の遺髪を納め、魔鬼山寺（まきやまじ）を建立したとされる。
田村将軍は、鬼退治を前にして観音菩薩に大悲威神のちからを祈願しており、その霊験に報いるため、鬼たちの暮らしていた山に、それぞれ観音菩薩を祀って供養をしたとされる。その際に用いられた観音像は、延鎮（清水寺の開基とされる僧））から授かった観音像だとされる。

魔鬼山と牧山
牧山の名前の由来は、鬼が暮らしていたことから「魔鬼山」と称されたことだと伝説では語られており、寺の名前だった魔鬼山寺も同様である。牧山には「延鎮僧都魔鬼山旧址」という碑が残されており、古刹として知られて来た。梅渓寺の記録では、弘仁7年（816年）に梅谷寺（再興以前の梅渓寺の寺号）が建立されたときに、魔鬼山から同音の牧山に文字を改めたという。牧山観音があった長禅寺（長全寺）は明治時代初期の神仏分離で零羊崎神社となっており、そのときに牧山観音は梅渓寺の境内に移された。
牧山には、牧山観音が祀られており、その寺社縁起のなかで魔鬼女の物語は形成されて来た。同様に箟岳山には大嶽丸に対して観音菩薩を祀って寺を建てている。坂上田村麻呂・延鎮と観音菩薩の関係は、清水寺（京都府）をはじめ、寺社縁起や奥浄瑠璃では古くから深い関係があるものとして語られつづけている。「大嶽丸を退治する田村将軍」という構図の物語を取り込んだ寺社縁起は、東北地方には非常に多く見られ、この牧山観音のものも、そのうちのひとつにかぞえられる。しかし、牧山観音を含む奥州三観音の縁起物語である奥州の三観音縁起には、田村将軍が大嶽丸と鬼たちを退治し、それぞれの山に封じた点は語られるのだが、魔鬼女についての話は登場しない。
一般的に『三観音縁起』などをもとに語られる伝説では、退治をした大嶽丸の首・胴・手足をそれぞれ三ヶ所に山に埋めて観音菩薩を祀った、ということになっている。その際に、田村将軍が大嶽丸を退治した舞台は牧山だともされる。

来歴
地元である須磨で語られる伝説によれば、姉妹は多井畑の村長の娘たちで、本来の名は「もしほ」と「こふじ」であった。須磨に汐汲みに出たところ、天皇の勘気を蒙り須磨に流されていた在原行平と出会い、「松風」「村雨」と名づけられて愛された。のちに行平は赦されて都に帰る際、松の木に形見の烏帽子と狩衣を掛けて残した。また『古今和歌集』にある「立ち別れ　いなばの山の　峰に生ふる　まつとし聞かば　いま帰り来む」（巻第八・離別　在原行平）の歌も、この離別の際に詠んだものとされる。松風・村雨姉妹は尼となって行平の旧居に庵を結び、彼を偲んだという。
須磨に配流された行平が海女と歌を交わす短い説話は『撰集抄』（13世紀中葉成立）に現れるが、海女の名は記されておらず、姉妹でもない。行平が心通わせる相手を、無名の海女に代えて松風・村雨とした謡曲『松風』（室町時代成立）は、『撰集抄』に加え、平安時代に成立して散逸した物語『あま人』や、『源氏物語』の影響を受けて成立したと考えられる。
謡曲『松風』以後、松風・村雨の悲恋の物語は広く知られることとなり、浄瑠璃や歌舞伎、近代には映画などにも取り入れられた。須磨には衣掛松や松風村雨堂など、彼女たちの伝承に基づく遺跡がいくつかあり、須磨区内には村雨町・松風町・行平町・衣掛町と名付けられた地名もある。

概要
平安時代に歌人で公卿の在原行平が、光孝天皇の怒りにふれて、仁和3年（887年）（文徳天皇の御代の説もある）に京から須磨へ左遷され蟄居した際、多井畑の村長の娘「もしほ」と「こふじ」の姉妹に出会い、2人をそれぞれ「松風」「村雨」と名付けて愛人とした。帰京の際、行平は狩衣と烏帽子を松に掛けて姉妹への形見とし旅立った。行平が都に帰った後も姉妹は、行平を慕い続け、行平の居宅のそばに庵を結び、観世音菩薩を祀り行平の無事を祈った。 その庵の跡が現在残るお堂と伝えられる。都に帰る行平と2人の姉妹の伝説は、悲しい別れの話として謡曲などにも取り入れられ、後世知られるようになる。
現在、敷地内には観音堂、供養塔、別れに臨み行平が植えた磯馴松、衣掛松、在原行平の和歌が刻まれる石碑などがある。
なお、「松風村雨の墓」が多井畑にあり、多井畑厄除八幡宮の西200ｍの広場の一隅に五輪塔二基がひっそり建っている。

行平の和歌
松風村雨堂入口に建てられた石碑には、行平の以下の歌が彫られている。

立ちわかれ
いなばの山の
峯におふる
まつとし聞かば
今かへりこむ
意味
あなたと別れて、私は因幡の国へ赴くが、因幡の稲羽山の峰に生える松のように、あなたが私の帰りを待っていると聞いたら、すぐにでも帰って来ましょう。
※「いなばの山」を現在の須磨離宮公園付近にある「稲葉山（月見山）」とする解釈し、行平が帰京の際、松風と村雨へ詠んだ別れの歌と考える説もあり、
　「私はあなたたちと別れ、都へ行くが、“いなばの山”に生える松のように、あなたたちが私の帰りを待つというのを聞けば、私はすぐにでも須磨に帰って来よう」
との意味となる。

謡曲「松風」
宮廷歌人であった在原行平が、須磨に流された際に出会った姉妹の海女を愛した話を基に、一途な恋慕や懊悩する女心を歌った叙情豊かで幽玄な趣を持った謡曲。
月の美しい秋の夜に、須磨の浦で諸国一見の旅の僧が、いわくあり気な松を見つけ、それが松風・村雨の旧跡と知り念仏を上げ弔う。とある塩屋に宿を乞うため訪ねたところ、2人の若い女海人が浜辺の夜景をめでながら汐汲み車を引いつつ帰ってくるところだった。僧は一夜の宿を得ることができ喜びもあらわに、在原行平の詠歌「わくらわに」を口にし夕暮れに弔った松風・村雨の松のことを話したところ、2人の女は、突然涙を流し、「実は自分たちは行平の愛を受け、恋ゆえに思い乱れ世を去った松風村雨の亡霊である」と告げ、行平との契りが忘れがたく、その妄執にひかれて、こうして現れ来たものだと告げる。昔を懐かしみ、行平の形見の烏帽子と狩衣を取り出しては身に着けるとむせび泣き、そのうちには物狂おしく舞い、妄執からの解脱の回向を僧に請うと、たちまちにその姿を消してしまった。あとにはただ松に吹く風の音が残るばかり。旅僧の夢であった。

概略
大和朝廷の時代、都に、顔に醜いあざのある姫がいたが、仏のお告げに従って豊後国深田に住む炭焼き小五郎のもとへ行き夫婦になる。
2人は数々の奇跡により富を得て長者となり、1人の娘が生まれた。般若姫と名付けられた娘は都にまで伝わるほどの美女に成長し、1人の男と結婚するが、実はその男は都より忍びで来ていた皇子（後の用明天皇）であった。
皇子は天皇の崩御により都へと帰ることになったが、姫はすでに身重であったため、「男の子が産まれたなら、跡継ぎとして都まで一緒に、女の子であったなら長者夫婦の跡継ぎとして残し、姫1人で来なさい」と告げて帰京してしまう。
産まれた子供は女の子であったため、姫は1人で船に乗り都を目指すが、途中嵐に会い周防国大畠に漂着する。村人による介抱も虚しく数日後に姫は逝去してしまう。
姫の死を悲しんだ長者は中国の寺に黄金を送るとともに、深田の岩崖に仏像を彫らせた。その仏像が現在も残る国宝臼杵石仏である。
という物語である。

民話の伝承
臼杵石仏の制作年代は、仏像の様式などから平安時代後期〜鎌倉時代と推定されている。よってこの長者の時代とは数百年の差があり、直結するとは言いがたい。
しかし、過去に石仏を彫らせるほどの富を得た長者がいたことは事実であろうと考えられ、石仏近くの満月寺には室町時代の作とみられる「真名野長者夫婦石像」が伝わっており、伝説そのものもかなり古くからあったことがわかる。
伝説中に出てくる「用明天皇が皇子の時に九州大分まで旅して来ていた」との伝については疑問視する声も多いが、大分市坂ノ市にある万弘寺は用明天皇の創建であることが伝えられており、近年の調査によっても法隆寺と同等の伽藍配置を持っていた可能性が指摘され、地元民俗学者の肯定材料となっている。
また、同じく伝説の中で語られている「姫島の由来」（後述）についても、現地姫島では「古事記に記されているイザナギとイザナミから産まれた女島（天一根）であることに由来する」とされており、一致しない。
民話の性質上、語り手や著者によってさまざまな脚色が加えられ非現実的な内容に変わっていることも少なくないが、神話などと同じく、ある1つの事実に基づいて作られた可能性は否定できない。

「臼杵伝承」と「三重町伝承」との違い
一方、豊後大野市三重町には、『内山記』『内山山王宮縁起』などの古文書が現存しており、真名野長者が活躍した具体的な年代や、実在した天皇名・貴族名・豪族名、さらに活動の舞台となった地名、朝鮮半島や中国大陸との交流実績なども詳細に記録されている。
「三重町伝承」では下記の諸点が「臼杵伝承」とは異なっており、この論争は現在まで続いているが、いずれにせよ真名野長者は豊後国に実在した人物である可能性が高い。
◆真名野長者が誕生したのは、三重町の玉田の里である。
⇒現在でもその場所に石碑がある。
◆若い頃住んでいたのは、三重町の蓮城寺の敷地の中である。
⇒このお寺には真名野長者が娘の病気平癒のため奉納した千体薬師如来像がある。
◆娘が用明天皇と結婚することになったため、新婚夫婦用の新居を臼杵の深田の里に新築した。
⇒つまり真名野長者はその活動拠点を三重町から臼杵に移した。
◆真名野長者夫妻のお墓は、三重町の蓮城寺の境内にある。
⇒「臼杵伝承」では、深田の満月寺の境内と伝わる。

民話として語られる伝説の骨子
継体天皇の頃、豊後国玉田に、藤治という男の子が産まれたが、3歳で父と、7歳で母と死に別れ、臼杵深田に住む炭焼きの又五郎の元に引き取られ、名前を小五郎と改めた。
その頃、奈良の都、久我大臣の娘で玉津姫という女性がいたが、10歳の時、顔に大きなあざが現れ醜い形相になり、それが原因で嫁入りの年頃を迎えても縁談には恵まれなかった。姫は大和国の三輪明神へと赴き、毎晩願を掛けていた。
9月21日の夜、にわか雨にあった姫は拝殿で休養していたところ、急に眠気を覚え、そのまま転寝してしまった。すると、夢枕に三輪明神が現れ、こう告げた。「豊後国深田に炭焼き小五郎という者がいる。その者がお前の伴侶となる者である。金亀ヶ淵で身を清めよ。」
姫は翌年2月に共を連れて西へと下るが、途中難に会い、臼杵へたどり着いた時には姫1人となってしまっていた。人に尋ね探しても小五郎という男は見つからず、日も暮れ途方に暮れていたところ、1人の老人に出会った。「小五郎の家なら知っておるが、今日はもう遅い。私の家に泊まり、明日案内することにしよう。」
翌日姫が目を覚ますと、泊まったはずの家はなく、大きな木の下に老人と寝ていたのであった。老人は目を覚ますと姫を粗末なあばら家まで案内し、たちまちどこかへ消えてしまった。
姫が家の中で待っていると、全身炭で真っ黒になった男が帰ってきた。男は姫を見て驚いたが、自分の妻になるために来たと知り、さらに驚いた。
男は「私1人で食べるのがやっとの生活で、とても貴女を養うほどの余裕はない」と言うと、姫は都より持ってきた金を懐から出し「これで食べる物を買って来てください。」と言って男に渡した。
金を受取った男は不思議そうな顔をしながら出ていった。麓の村までは半日はかかるはずであるのに、半時もしないうちに手ぶらで帰ってきた男は言った。「淵に水鳥がいたので、貴女からもらった石を投げてみたが、逃げられてしまったよ。」
姫は呆れ返って言った。「あれはお金というものです。あれがあれば、さまざまな物と交換できるのです。」
すると男は笑いながら言った。「なんだ、そんな物なら、私が炭を焼いている窯の周りや、先程の淵に行けば、いくらでも落ちているさ。」
姫は驚き、男に連れていってくれるように頼んだ。行ってみると、炭焼き小屋の周囲には至るところから金色に光るものが顔を出しており、2人はそれらを集めて持ち帰った。
さらに水鳥がいたという淵へ行ってみると、中から金色に輝く亀が現れ、そのまま水の中へと潜っていった。
「ここがお告げにあった『金亀ヶ淵』に違いない！」と思った姫は淵の水で身を清めた。すると顔のあざは瞬く間に消え去り、輝くばかりの美しい姿となった。
2人は夫婦となり、屋敷を建てた場所が真名野原（まなのはら）というところであったことから、「真名野長者」と呼ばれるようになった。
やがて2人の間には娘が産まれ、般若姫と名付けられた。姫は成長すると輝くような美女になり、その噂は遠く都にまで伝わっていった。多くの貴族たちが后にと使いを送ってきたが、長者夫婦は「大事な跡取り娘であるので」と断りつづけた。
その頃、都では皇子達の間で後継争いが勃発していた。兄は有力豪族の支援を得て優勢であったが、弟はいつ暗殺されてもおかしくないほど危うい状況であった。弟は豊後国の美女の噂を聞き、「どれほどの美女かこの目で見てみたい」との口実を作り都を脱出する。豊後国に到着すると宇佐八幡宮へ参拝して皇位を預け、名も山路と変えて長者の屋敷の下働きとして潜りこんだ。
長者は使用人達や客人をもてなすための建物をいくつも建てたが、これらが竣工する頃になって姫が病にふせってしまった。長者はあらゆる名医やまじない師を呼んだが治る気配がなかったのだが、山王権現へ祈願したときに「三重の松原にて笠掛の的を射よ」とのお告げがあった。
長者の周囲の者は笠掛の的を知らず困惑したが、山路が知っているというので命じてみると、すぐに馬に乗り的を射て山王権現より錫杖の下賜を受けて戻ってきた。
長者は姫が回復すると2人を娶わせ、新たな屋敷を建てて住まわせようとしたが、屋敷が完成する前に勅使が下向し兄天皇の崩御を伝えてきた。
山路は長者に本当の身分を明かし、都に帰らなければならないことを告げた。しかし、般若姫は既に皇子の子を身籠っており、共には上京できない状態であった。
翌年、般若姫は女の子を出産し、玉絵姫と名付けた。般若姫は玉絵姫を長者夫婦に預けると、千人余りの従者を引き連れて臼杵の港より都へ向けて出発した。
長者夫婦は山の上から船を見送り、その山は姫見ヶ岳と呼ばれるようになった。また、姫の一行は、途中豊前国の小さな島に立ちよった。この島が現在の姫島（大分県）である。
般若姫を乗せた船はしばらく順調に航海を続けるが、周防国田浦にて暴風雨に巻き込まれ遭難。大畠に漂着したところを地元の村人に救助され介抱を受けるが数日後に他界。享年19。
姫の死を悲しんだ長者は姫の菩提を弔うため、中国の寺へ黄金三万両を贈った。すると中国より蓮城法師が長者のためにやってきた。
長者は満月寺を建立して法師の居とし、石仏の製作を依頼した。法師は数年の歳月をかけて深田の里一帯に石仏を彫った。これが現在の国宝臼杵石仏の由縁である。
その後、推古天皇の時代に長者は97歳で、玉津姫は91歳でこの世を去った。

真名野長者の孫が聖徳太子だとする説
「臼杵伝承」「三重町伝承」ともに、「真名野長者の孫娘は、父の用明天皇に会いに行く途中で船が難破して亡くなった」と伝えている。
ところが一方で、江戸時代を中心に「その孫とは男子であり、聖徳太子となった」とする説が大流行して、下記の著作物にも残されている。
『用明天皇職人鑑』････近松門左衛門作の浄瑠璃の台本だが、その結末には「用明天皇夫妻とその息子・聖徳太子は、三人仲良く豊後国を出発して都へ帰った」とある。
『御伽草子』に収蔵された『烏帽子折』････源義経が元服する物語のなかに、突然真名野長者物語が挿入され、その結末も「真名野長者の孫が聖徳太子である」となっている。
ちなみに「三重町伝承」では、“真名野長者は百済から伝来した仏像を日本で初めて拝んだ人物”とされていることや、“物部守屋と交戦した”と書かれていることから、正史による蘇我稲目のことではないかという説も浮上している。

類型
柳田國男はこの話（炭焼きの小五郎）が北は青森県岩木山麓から南は沖縄県宮古島まで分布し、鍛冶屋や鋳物師などの金属の業に従事する者達によって運ばれたとする（「海南小記」『定本柳田邦夫集』一、筑摩書房 1969年）。『中山世譜』内にある王が浦添の按司になった経緯の話（押しかけ女房・財宝を粗末に扱ったために妻に注意される・最終的には裕福となる）も類型とされる（大林太良 『日本の古代10 山人の生業』 中央公論社 1987年 p.246.）。

上演
地元の有志たちにより、大分方言で上演されることがあるが、完璧な豊後方言で上演すると、ほとんどの観客には意味が通じないため、現代方言をさらに簡略化した形で行われることが多い。

1970年代に芸術家の岡本太郎が紹介したことで日本全国に広く知られるようになった。
「万治の石仏」は、下諏訪商工会議所を権利者とする登録商標でもある。

概要
高さ2.6メートル、幅3.8メートル、奥行き3.7メートルの安山岩（含角閃石普通輝石安山岩）をそのまま胴体とし、その上に高さ約65センチメートルの仏頭を乗せた石仏である。胴体正面には定印を結んだ阿弥陀如来の坐像が彫られる。衣の上には向かって右から右卍、太陽・雷・雲・磐座・月など密教の曼荼羅が刻まれ、これらは木食上人・弾誓(たんぜい)に始まる浄土宗の作仏聖(さぶつひじり)一派による「同体異仏」（一体の仏像に阿弥陀如来と大日如来を共存させる）の表現とされる。願主の明誉浄光および心誉廣春は、それぞれ清念(法名・明誉)、説難(法名・心誉)として作仏聖の系図に名を連ねており、明誉が同石仏の仏頭を刻み、心誉が胴体の彫刻を受け持ったと考えられている。
江戸時代の史料には「えぼし石」や「みたらしの石仏」の名称で記録されており、地元の人々からは「あみだ様」と呼ばれてきた。
胴体正面向かって左側に「万治三年」の銘が刻まれていることにちなみ、近年になって「万治の石仏」の名称が生まれている。公知の文献としては、1932年（昭和7年）の刊行物における有賀恭一による「諏訪の石」の解説中に、「萬治の石佛」の記述が見られる。また地元の考古学者・中村龍雄は、1961年（昭和36年）5月28日の下諏訪町博物館（現・諏訪湖博物館）主催の町内史跡巡りの際の図面や案内順列表に「万治の石仏（阿弥陀如来）」の記載があると述べている。
この石仏が全国的に知られるようになったきっかけは、1974年（昭和49年）に中村龍雄、地域紙「湖国新聞」編集長・市川一雄らが、諏訪大社の視察に訪れた岡本太郎を現地に案内したことにある。そこで同石仏を鑑賞した岡本が絶賛し、全国紙のコラムなどに掲載した。さらに、上諏訪町（現・諏訪市）出身の小説家・新田次郎もこれに着目し、同石仏はイースター島の石人の頭部が日本へもたらされたものとする大胆な想定を基にして小説『万治の石仏』を著している。これらにより、「万治の石仏」の名称が定着し、知名度も上昇して全国的な観光名所となっていく。
これ以降、「万治の石仏」の名称を産業財産権として利用する動きも活性化する。市川一雄と交友関係にあり、下諏訪町で製菓業と学習塾を営む傍ら、当時湖国新聞でコラムを連載していた矢ヶ崎孫次によって、「万治の石仏」を菓子類の商品名として使用するための商標登録出願（1975年9月6日、区分：菓子、パン）がなされている。続いて、別の出願人から他区分（調味料、穀物の加工品、べんとう）での出願も行われている。
なお、市川一雄と矢ヶ崎孫次はそれぞれ、自身が「万治の石仏」命名者であると述懐している。実際には既存の名称であったことは先述の通りであり、両者いずれも命名者には当たらないが、湖国新聞などのメディアを通じた1970年代中盤の両者の活動も、同石仏の知名度の向上に貢献したと言える。
2019年（令和元年）以降の新型コロナウイルス感染症拡大下にある近年は「万治」が「よろずおさまる」に通じることから注目が高まっており、石仏がモチーフの関連グッズの人気が高まっているという。

伝承
「万治の石仏」には、造立にまつわる以下の伝承がある。
1657年（明暦3年）に第3代諏訪高島藩主の諏訪忠晴から諏訪大社下社春宮に石の大鳥居を立てるよう命じられた石工が、現在石仏となっている大石を材料にしようと鑿を入れたところ、そこから血が出てきたため祟りを恐れて作業を中止した。その晩に夢枕で上原山（現在の茅野市）に良い石材があると告げられた石工が探しに行くとその通りであり、同山の石で鳥居を造る代わりに大石を阿弥陀如来として祀ったという。石仏に残る鑿の跡はその時のものとされる。

伸びる首
1991年（平成3年）8月に一度頭部が落下したため支柱で固定し修復したが、その後、ある写真家が毎年撮った写真を見たところ、首が伸びていることがわかった。2007年（平成19年）にテレビ番組で紹介され、観光客も増えたが、下諏訪観光協会は「周辺の安全確保」ためとして再修復することとし、2008年（平成20年）3月4日に修復作業が行われ、頭部の下から水や泥、賽銭25円が発見された。首が伸びた原因は、以前の修復時に設けた支柱に水が溜まり、氷になって斜めになり、その繰り返しで頭部が上昇したとされる。修復前に測定したところ、正面で4cm、左右は6～7cm上昇していた。

卯の木大明神の起こり
以前はこの辺りは卯の木という地名で、卯の木大明神を守り神としていた。卯の木大明神の祭神は竜宮の姫であるという。
履中天皇（在位:400年? - 405年?）の時代。深津（現・前橋市粕川町深津）の高野辺左大将家成（たかのべのさだいしょういえなり）という人物がこの岩山にやってきたとき、一人の美女が表れ、家成に「この岩窟は竜神の宮殿であるから失礼のないよう」告げた。家成はこのときから竜宮を敬うようになった。
雄略天皇（在位:457年? - 479年?）の皇子・岩城皇子（いわきのみこ）（磐城皇子）が常陸国の筑波山（蚕の神が化生した地であることから）を視察に行く途中、碓氷峠を通った。その時夜間であったにもかかわらず、あたりが昼間のように明るくなり、一人の乙女が表れた。曰くこれは皇子の御成を祝福する竜燈で、自分は竜宮姫であると。視察を終えた皇子が卯の木の岩窟に立ち寄ると、竜宮姫は自分をこの地の産土神として祀ってほしいと皇子に依頼した。村人たちは竜宮姫を卯の木大明神として祀り、毎年6月28日を祭りの日と定めた。皇子が卯の木の岩窟に立ち寄ったのは4月12日で、この日は必ず恵みの雨が降るという。

竜宮の農太鼓
5月の半夏（新暦の7月2日頃）の10日ほど前になると、川の水底から太鼓のような音が聞こえる。近隣住民はこれを竜宮の農太鼓（りゅうぐうののうだいこ）と呼び、田植えに取り掛かる準備として利用した。半夏を過ぎるとこの音は次第に小さくなり、やがて鳴りやむ。

阿感坊
天正19年（1591年）、跡部良直（あとべよしなお）がこの地の領主に任命される。良直は阿感坊（あかんぼう）という人物について聞き知る。阿感坊は天文16年（1547年）に竜宮に行き、3年後に戻ってきたという。『群馬県史』によると、阿感坊は広瀬川の近くで藤の木を伐採していた際、誤って鉈を水中に落としてしまった。鉈を取りに行ったところ竜宮に辿りついたという。
良直は阿感坊を呼び、竜宮の様子を聞き出そうとした。はじめ阿感坊は「竜宮で口止めされた、話せば命はない」と断るが、良直は話さねば手打ちにすると激しく怒った。
いずれにせよ命はないと覚悟を決めた阿感坊は竜宮の様子を話し始めた。竜宮の1日は地上の1年である（1日のうちに四季の変化があることからそれが分かった）こと、建物や食器類が宝石で出来ていたこと、14・5歳から17・8歳の美少女たちが入れ替わり接客？してくれたことなど。また、二匹の白蛇が水中で踊りだすと太鼓の音が響いた。これが竜宮の農太鼓であろうとも話した。これらを話し終えた阿感坊は帰宅するが、その日のうちに死んでしまった。良直は阿感坊を丁重に弔った。
また良直は、阿感坊を自分の墓の隣に葬ってよいと許可した。阿感坊の墓は紅巌寺（こうがんじ）（現・宮子第二霊園。宮子町1416番地）に現存する。阿感坊は竜宮から帰還する際、1寸8分の観音像とメノウの玉と玉手箱を持たされたという。観音像は宮子町に祀られており、メノウの玉は宮子神社（宮子町1710番地）に持っていかれたと伝えられる。玉手箱は個人蔵。

弁慶の母弁吉について
弁慶の母弁吉は、紀州田那部(和歌山県田辺市)の郷士である誕象という男が熊野権現に祈って授けてもらった娘だったが、二十歳になっても結婚相手に恵まれなかった。
そのことを悲しんだ両親は、出雲の国の結びの神(安来市西松井町)の出雲路幸神社に祈って良縁を得させようと考え、弁吉を出雲国へ旅出させた(熊野権現のお告げとする説あり)。
出雲路幸神社に到着した弁吉は七日七夜参詣を続け、夢で枕木山の長海村で七年間住むことで願いはかなうとのお告げを得る。
弁吉はお告げに従い長海村に住み着き、三年経た頃山伏が来訪、山伏は出雲の神の縁結びにより弁吉の夫となる事に決まったと告げ立ち去った。
この後弁吉は身篭り、つわりのため鍬を食べる。村人の鍬を盗んで食べ続け、十本目の時村の子供に見つかってしまい、半分程食べ残してしまった。
或いは、10本目の半分を食べた所で、弁慶が出てきたと解釈することもできる。
その後、1151年 (仁平元年)3月3日に、弁慶が誕生した。
弁慶の父については、『懐橘談』上（続々群書類従第9所収）の「枕木」の項目では熊野大社の別当弁斎となっているが、「天狗」や「山伏」の説が大半である。

弁慶の出生から出奔まで
産まれたばかりの弁慶は長髪に髪は長く、歯も生え揃い、左の肩には「摩利支天」、右の肩には「大天狗」の文字が刻まれ、顔の色は黒く鉄色だった。但し、母が鉄を食べ残したからか、喉の四寸四方だけは普通の肌になっていた。
母弁吉は自らが鍬を食べて産んだ事と弁慶の様相が普通の赤子とは違う事もあり、自らの手で井戸を掘り水を汲み、それを生湯に使った。
「弁慶」と言う名前に関して、母の弁吉は弁慶のことを初め「弁太」と名付けた。
弁慶が子どもの頃、悪戯が過ぎ村人に憎まれた為、母弁吉は中海にある小島へ弁慶を捨てた。後にこの小島は弁慶島(野原町)と呼ばれる事になる。
弁慶島に於いて弁慶は父である山伏と出会い、脱出の助言を得、砂を海中に落として海に渡り道を作りようやく脱出した。
修行に行く前、弁太は鬼若と改名する。
その後、枕木山にある華蔵寺(けぞうじ)、福原の澄水寺(ちょうすいじ)、出雲の鰐淵寺(がくえんじ)に立ち寄り修行をして母の元へと戻った。
修行が終わると鬼若は弁慶と改名した。
成長した弁慶はある時出雲の別所で鍛冶屋をしている叔父に薙刀を作ってくれるよう注文。三年後に出来上がった薙刀は鉄丸も切ることのできるすばらしい切れ味だった。
そこで叔父が注文が有ればいくらでも作ると話した事で、他人にも作られては堪らないと思った弁慶は叔父を切り殺し、出奔しようとした。
その時折悪く母弁吉が病気に罹り、際の際(いまわのきわ)に最期近くなった母弁吉は彼を枕元へ呼び、「菩提を弔おうと思うのなら、紀州国に行き、誕象一門を訪ねよ。そして、武士になるのなら田那部を、また法師になるなら武蔵坊と名乗るように」と遺言して亡くなった。
そこで弁慶は長海神社に参詣し、書状を書き置いて出雲地方を去り京都へ上り、後に源頼朝の弟である牛若丸と運命の出合いをした。牛若丸はその後義経と改めている。

弁慶まつり
毎年10月の最終日曜日に鰐淵寺において開催される。

概要
信濃国の戸隠山に鬼がおり、平維茂によってそれが退治されたというのが共通する伝説の要素である。その鬼は女性であり、名前を紅葉（もみじ）であるとするものが一般に流布されている。
室町時代から江戸時代にかけて、能や浄瑠璃、歌舞伎では「紅葉狩」（もみじがり）という題名で描かれつづけ、平維茂が戸隠山におもむき、そこで出会った紅葉見物の美しい女性たち一行に出遭うという展開を設けている。その女性たちの正体が戸隠山の鬼、鬼女・紅葉であるとする。能をもとにして作られた河竹黙阿弥による歌舞伎『紅葉狩』（1887年）は、紅葉に相当する鬼の名を更科姫（さらしなひめ）としている。
明治中期に出版された『戸隠山鬼女紅葉退治之伝』では、紅葉は伴氏の子孫であるとされ、第六天の魔王の力を持つ鬼とされる。元は呉葉（くれは）と呼ばれていたが、後に紅葉に名を改めて都に上り、都で源経基（みなもと の つねもと）に寵愛され一子を宿すが、戸隠の地へ流される。里の者に尊崇されるいっぽう、徒党を組んで盗賊を働き、冷泉天皇の勅諚によって派遣された平維茂の軍勢により、退治される。紅葉の一生を詳しく描いており、紅葉の出所や戸隠以前などを示している紅葉伝説はこの本の出版以後、『大語園』などその内容を典拠としたものが多い。
『善光寺道名所図会』によれば、退治された紅葉の霊は八丈坊・九丈坊という大天狗・小天狗となり、日吉権現の眷属となって北向山を守護するようになったという。

戸隠山の鬼
戸隠山に鬼が存在し、それを武士が退治するという内容はほぼ一致しているが、紅葉のような女の鬼であるとしない伝承も古くから見られる。
その最古の例は13世紀に記された『阿裟縛抄』である。これによれば、9世紀中頃に「学門（学問とも）」という修行者が九つの頭と龍の尾を持つ鬼を岩戸に閉じこめ、善神に転じて水神として人々を助けたとされる。なお、この鬼の龍の尾は越後国の尾崎という荒磯まで伸びており、その地方では尾崎権現として信仰されたという。
『太平記』（巻32　直冬上洛事 附鬼丸鬼切事）では多田満仲（ただ の みつなか）が戸隠山で鬼を斬り、その刀が「鬼切」と名づけられたとされ、これが戸隠山に鬼が存在したという伝説として広く影響を与え、能などにも採り入れられたと考えられている。
また、戸隠神社につたわる『戸隠山絵巻』という室町時代ころに作られたとされる物語では、元正天皇の時代に九生大王（きゅうしょうだいおう）という鬼が戸隠山におり、きひの大臣がそれを退治する。能の『紅葉狩』やお伽草子の『酒呑童子』の影響を文章上の用語などでも受けており、手下の鬼たちが女の姿に化けて大臣一行の前に姿を現わしてもいる。

戸隠神社の祭事と鬼女伝説
菅江真澄の『くめじの橋』では、平維茂が鬼（名は「荒倉の紅葉」）を平定した7月7日、8日、9日にちなみ、9月の7日、8日、9日に、顕光寺（現在の戸隠神社）において、紅葉した楓を高杯や窪杯に盛り付け、3日間鬼の亡魂を弔う「紅葉会」という行事が紹介されており、紅葉会の後に岩屋に楓を奉納すれば、その楓が越後国尾崎に出現するとされる。
また、『善光寺道名所図会』によれば、顕光寺最大の祭事である「七月会」において、長刀を振り上げる動作があるが、これは平維茂の鬼神退治の古例に則ったものであるとされる。

魏石鬼八面大王の妻とする伝説
魏石鬼八面大王の妻を紅葉鬼神とする伝承も残る。

伝説の舞台

概要
小野小町に熱心に求愛する深草少将。小町は彼の愛を鬱陶しく思っていたため、自分の事をあきらめさせようと「私のもとへ百夜通ったなら、あなたの意のままになろう」と彼に告げる。それを真に受けた少将はそれから小町の邸宅へ毎晩通うが、思いを遂げられないまま最後の雪の夜に息絶えた。
中世以降、百夜通いは小野小町の恋愛遍歴を象徴するエピソードとして民間にまで広く流布した。ただしそれは「衰老落魄説話」という後日談とともにである。能作者たちは老いて乞食（こつじき。被差別民・非人の呼称の一つ）となった小野小町を描く事で、彼女を伝説的な美女から、人生の栄枯盛衰を経た一人の女性に変えた。

概要
病床の聖武天皇への夢告「都の南西におられる観音菩薩をお迎えすれば、たちまち快癒するであろう」という勅命を受けて、観音菩薩探索に出立した行基が白鳥に導かれて南西の方向に進んだところ、突然、白鳥は姿を消し、途方に暮れていた行基の前に童子が現われ、行基を水間にある瀧に導き、観音菩薩との出会いを成就させたという。この童子が十六童子の化身であると伝えられている。この伝説に因んで、泉南エリアで活動する「土の子陶房」によって制作されたのが、これらの像である。

地形
位置
福井県南条郡南越前町（旧今庄町）と岐阜県揖斐郡揖斐川町（旧坂内村）との境の、夜叉ヶ池山と三周ヶ岳との鞍部である標高1,099 mの稜線直下北西側に位置する。周囲は原生林におおわれている。数十万年前に起きた地滑りによってできた窪地に雨水や周辺の山からの伏流水が溜まり、池になったと考えられている。

水系
池からの河川の出口がなく、伏流水となって周辺に湧き出でるため、九頭竜川水系日野川の支流である岩谷川の源流部に位置する。

周囲：230 m
最深部：7.7 m

周辺の山
三国岳、夜叉ヶ池山、三周ヶ岳、冠山、能郷白山、伊吹山

生物相
夜叉ヶ池の固有種であるヤシャゲンゴロウが生息し、環境省と福井県によりレッドリストの絶滅危惧I類の指定を受けている。またモリアオガエル、クロサンショウウオ、アカハライモリなどが生息し、魚類は生息していない。ヤシャゲンゴロウは、モリアオガエルやクロサンショウウオのオタマジャクシやトンボのヤゴなどをエサとして、池の生態系の頂点に立つ。
アカモノ、カタクリ、ミツバツチグリ、トクワカソウ、ニッコウキスゲ等中部地方の低山でありながら亜高山植物が多い。池の西畔には2004年9月に木道が整備され、生物の生息環境が保護されている。

神社
昔より、雨乞いが行われていた池であり、畔には奥宮夜叉龍神社がある。

交通アクセス
岐阜県揖斐郡揖斐川町の池ノ又林道終点の夜叉ヶ池登山口駐車場から約3km（徒歩約90分）。登山道には険しい箇所もあり、稜線直下名の急な岩場の斜面にはロープが設置されている。福井県側からも岩谷林道終点から登山道が整備されている。積雪期には登山口への林道は冬期閉鎖され、適期は6-11月ごろ。

県境の変遷
夜叉ヶ池の位置は、昔より美濃国（岐阜県）と越前国（福井県）のどちらが所有するかで争いが発生している。1875年（明治8年）、両県の立会いのもと検分が行われ、夜叉ヶ池の住所は坂内村大字川上字池之又986番地とされ、岐阜県に属することとなり、1880年（明治13年）には公式の地図もそうなった。しかし、1909年（明治42年）に陸地測量部（日本陸軍の地図作成部署）がこの地域を測量し、その結果を1913年（大正2年）に公式の地図に記載したさいは、両県の県境は分水嶺の稜線を引いたため、夜叉ヶ池は福井県側に属すこととなる。現在国土地理院の地図では福井県南条郡南越前町になっているが、岐阜県側は1875年の検分結果を主張し、福井県側は1909年の測量結果を主張している。

夜叉ヶ池の伝説
安八郡の伝説
雨乞いのための生贄として龍神に嫁ぐ話が最も一般的で、越前・美濃・近江の3国に分布しているが、固有名詞の具体性などから、そのルーツは美濃国（岐阜県）安八郡であろう。

安八太夫安次の子孫は現在も岐阜県安八郡神戸町に健在であり、今は石原姓を名乗っている。石原家はもとは当地の神主・司祭であり、夜叉ヶ池伝説はもともとこの石原家の由来を説く祖先説話だったと思われる。
岐阜県安八郡神戸町大字安次にある自宅には、安八太夫安次と夜叉を祭る夜叉堂がある。夜叉堂参拝する際、個人宅の為、事前に連絡し予約が必要である。
また、夜叉姫は、夜叉龍神社にて夜叉龍神という名で祀られている。

他の伝説
福井県にも良く似た伝説がある。こちらの伝説では、越前国南条郡池ノ上の弥兵次という豪農が主人公である。内容は岐阜県側に伝わる伝説とほぼ同じである。
福井県にはこのような後日談も伝わる。

今庄には他にこのような物語もある。

この物語は日本各地に分布する「蛇婿入」物語の一種であり、記紀神話でタマヨリビメが三輪氏の先祖オオタタネコを産んだ話の変異形である。
また、慈眼寺の縁起によると、その昔、夫婦がこの池に沈み夜叉と化したため、夜叉ヶ池と呼ぶという。数百年後、慈眼寺の僧天真が彼らを成仏させたという。

戯曲『夜叉ケ池』
泉鏡花の戯曲『夜叉ケ池』では村を越前国大野郡鹿見村（ただし実際の鹿見村は南条郡で、現在は南条郡南越前町）とし、娘が雨乞いの生贄にされるという大枠は同じだがかなり脚色されている。白雪（生贄の娘）は龍神と化し洪水を起こすが、越の大徳泰澄により池に封印される。なお、戯曲の本筋はそれから1200年が過ぎた現代（執筆当時）の物語である。現在、岩波文庫から「夜叉ケ池・天守物語」（緑27-3）として発行されている。

概要
名前からわかるように、山に出るもの、サメのような悪魚だとされている点は共通しているが、はっきりした情報は多く残されていない。
福井県大野市の柿ヶ島では、滝ノ谷と呼ばれる場所に山鮫が住んでいたとされる。滝ノ谷でやぶを焼き畑して切り拓いたところ、突然に大きな池ができるという不思議な現象が起こった事があり、「山鮫のせいだ」と思った村人たちが農地にするのを辞めて、やぶに戻したところ、池は消えてなくなったという話が残されている。
兵庫県東粟倉村（現・美作市）では、夏になると山鮫がまれに出て来ると言われていたという。田んぼに出たので打ち殺した山鮫であると称された生物は、ウリのような楕円形で鱗があり、足はなかったという。博物学者の大上宇市は、これについて実在の有肺類の生物・プロトプテラス（肺魚の仲間）のような生物なのではないか――という雑録報告を寄せているが、捕獲されたものが山鮫とされて来たものであったのかの確証は特に示されておらず、想像の域を出ていない。

芸能
江戸時代から語られていた剣豪が各地を武者修業していたという設定の作品群のなかで、山鮫退治の話は語られつづけていた。歌川国芳による浮世絵『本朝水滸伝剛勇八百人一個　宮本無三四』に描かれている山鮫魚（やまざめ）も、穴間越という美濃国・飛騨国・越前国のちょうど中間にあたる峠道で宮本武蔵が山鮫退治をするという『絵本二島英雄記』（1803年）にもある物語を画題にしている。
明治時代に入っても、『宮本左門之助武勇伝』をはじめとしたボール表紙本や児童向けの絵本で、宮本左門之助あるいは宮本武蔵が大きな鰐のような山鮫を退治する場面の絵が描かれているのを確認する事ができる。

百合若大臣は、蒙古襲来に対する討伐軍の大将に任命され、神託により持たされた鉄弓をふるい、遠征でみごとに勝利を果たすが、部下によって孤島に置き去りにされる。しかし鷹の緑丸によって生存が確認され、妻が宇佐神宮に祈願すると帰郷が叶い、裏切り者を成敗する、という内容である。

最古の言及
この物語に関する最古の言及は、1551年2月10日付の『言継卿記』で、京都で「ゆりわか」が朗誦された記録だとされてきた。だがそれ以前の1514年、『雲玉和歌抄』に「百合草若大臣、嶋に棄てられておはしけるに、緑丸といふ鷹...」の言及があることが指摘されている。また、『熊谷家伝記』の大永2年（1522年）正月4日の条には、百合草若大臣の持念の本尊とされる11面観音像が、信州伊那の郷に物語とともに享徳年間に持ち込まれた、という記述がある。
このことは、オデュッセイアとの類似の論争において重要性があり、前者はかろうじてポルトガル宣教師による伝来が可能な年代だが、後者ではその可能性はまったく乏しくなる。

諸本
現存最古のテキストは、一説では室町末期の幸若舞の台本（曲本の写本）とされる。これは《大頭左兵衛本》所収のものであるが、題名は単に『大臣』であり、主人公も「百合草若大臣」、「百合草大臣」、「ゆりわか大臣」と幾通りかの名称で登場する。
また能楽にも室町末期の謡曲『百合草若』があり、こちらも主人公が「百合草若」とも「百合若」とも表記されている。
幸若舞の台本のテキストは、のちに「舞の本」と題する読み物として普及するようになった。そうした「舞の本」版の百合若説話には戦国から江戸初期にかけて木版刷本が数種ある。このうち慶長14年（1609年）本「百合若大臣」 や、寛永年間本 などが、近代において校訂・出版されている。
人形劇をまじえた説経操りの演劇である「百合若大臣」には、日暮小太夫(ひぐらし こだゆう)の正本（寛文2年刊行）がある。
浄瑠璃には近松門左衛門作『百合若大臣野守鏡』（宝永7年/1710年）があるが、これには例えば鷹の緑丸が、雌鷹の矢羽をつけた矢の精霊に置き換わるなど、様々な改変が加わり、（元の粗筋から離れた）後世の作品と評される。為永太郎兵衛の作の『百合稚高麗軍記』は、鷹はそのまま生き物として登場するものの、それ以外では粗筋の逸脱はいっそう甚だしい。古浄瑠璃としては『百合若麿』（井上播磨掾の正本）、『百合若高麗攻』（岡本文弥）があることが、水谷不倒の研究であきらかにされているという。

時代設定
幸若舞の『百合若大臣』（室町後期に成立）では、嵯峨天皇在位中（809-823年）に蒙古襲来となっているが、史実の元寇は、13世紀。

幸若舞のあらすじ
以下、幸若舞の「百合若大臣」の粗筋を示す。

出生
父親は、嵯峨朝の左大臣「公満（きんみつ）」で、大和国の初瀬寺の観音に祈願して授けられた男児が後の百合若大臣である。百合若は17歳で右大臣に就任し、大納言章時（あきとき）の娘を妻に迎える。
蒙古との戦闘
百合若は、日本（博多）へ押し寄せてきた蒙古（むくり）の大軍討伐を命じられ、当地である筑紫の国司という任地を与えられる。妻は豊後国に構えた館に残す。託宣に従い、百合若は八尺五寸の鉄弓と363箭の矢を持たされる。
蒙古軍は、すでに神風に遭って唐土（もろこし）（中国大陸）に引き上げていた。百合若は船団を従えてこれを追い、ちくらが沖の海上で決戦となる。蒙古側は、麒麟国の王が青息を吹いて霧をたちこめらすが、百合若が日本の神々に祈願するとようやく霧が晴れる。百合若は矢をほとんど撃ち尽くして奮戦し、蒙古側の四大将の両蔵（りょうぞう）らを討ち取り、あるいは捕虜となし勝利をおさめる。
部下の裏切り
百合若は、玄界ガ島（玄界島？）に立寄って休息し、その大力を発揮したときの常として、まる3日間眠りこける。これに乗じて、配下の別府兄弟は、百合若は矢傷で死んだと偽り、船を引き揚げさせ、百合若を孤島に置き去りにしてしまう。別府兄弟は朝廷に戦勝を奏上し、別府太郎は、百合若が配されていた筑紫の国司の役目に任命される。
御台所と鷹の緑丸
上司の地位簒奪に収まらず、別府太郎はさらに百合若の御台所に恋愛を迫る。御台所は、宇佐神宮で千部の写経を行っている最中だとして、とりあえず返答を引き延ばす。しかし百合若がついに帰らなければ自殺すると決めているので、身の回りの琵琶や琴を整理し、飼っている犬、馬や鷹の数々を解き放つ。このとき緑丸という鷹は、玄界島まで飛んでゆき、百合若に託されて柏の葉に血で書いた文を持ち帰る。御台所は、夫の生存を知り、墨や硯などを鷹に結びつけて送り返すが、鷹はこの重さに耐えかね、死体の姿で漂着する。
宇佐神宮に、御台所が夫の生還を祈願すると、その願いがかない、壱岐の浦にいた釣り人が風で流され、玄界ガ島にいた百合若を発見して、日本の本土に送り戻す。着いた場所は博多であった。百合若のあまりの変わり果てように、誰もその正体がわからない。別府は余興としてこの奇異なる男を召し抱えることにし、門脇の翁という者に預ける。
身代わりの池
このころ、別府は御台所がなびかないので、ついに処刑すると決めていた。しかしそうはさせまいと、門脇の翁の娘が身代わりになったことを百合若は知る。
復讐
正月になり、宇佐八幡宮での初弓で、百合若は「苔丸」という名で呼ばれて矢取りの役を仰せつかる。面々の弓の技量を嘲弄した百合若は、別府に一矢射て見せよと命令される。揃えられた強弓はゆるいと言って、ついにはかの鉄の弓をもってこさせ、みごとこれを引き絞り自分は百合若であるとの名乗りを上げる。大友氏の諸卿や松浦党はかしこまり、別府太郎は降参するが許さず、百合若はこれを縛り上げさせ、手づかみで舌を引き抜き、首切りは7日かけて鋸挽きの刑に処した。
命の恩人の釣り人には壱岐と対馬国を下賜し、門脇の翁は筑紫の荘園の政所の職につけ、百合若は、京に上り将軍となった。

伝説
日本各地に伝説として伝わり、沖縄から北海道まで広く分布するが、特に九州、それも大分県に集中して伝わっている。

大分の百合若伝説
左大臣・公光の子の百合若は、成長するにつれて弓に長けた勇武の若者となり、その名は近隣にも響くようになる。鉄弓はかねてからもちいていた。やがて春日姫という美しい嫁を迎え睦まじく暮らすが、豊後の国司に任じられる。百合若は、日本へ押し寄せてきた蒙古の大軍討伐を命じられる。この侵略を追い払った百合若は、対馬沖で対決し、蒙古の大軍を打ち破る。戦いに勝った後、別府太郎ら部下に裏切られ玄海島に置いて行かれる百合若。別府太郎らは帰国後、天子に百合若は病没したという虚偽の報告をして豊後の国司の知行を得た。太郎に恋愛を迫られてもなお、百合若の死を信じられぬ姫は、手紙を鷹の緑丸の脚に結びつけて放す。鷹は玄海島にたどりつき、百合若が血で書いた文を返信する。春日姫は今度は鷹に硯や筆・墨を括って送り出すが、荷重のために海に落ち、遺骸となって百合若の元に漂着する。百合若は、嵐が吹き寄せた漁船に便乗し、豊後に帰還すると正体を隠して「苔丸」と名乗り、別府太郎のもとに仕える。正月の弓始めの式で、百合若は別府の弓術を嘲笑し、得意の弓術を披露するチャンスを得る。鉄の弓をあてがわれると、百合若は、自分を裏切った太郎をなじったうえで射抜き、復讐を果たす。その後百合若は春日姫と涙の再会を果たし、国司の位も取り戻した。春日姫の身代わりとなった菰（まこも）の池に身を投げた、門番の翁の娘の万寿姫を忍んで百合若は、菰山万寿寺を建立。また、鷹の緑丸の菩提を弔うために高尾山神宮寺を建立した。

壱岐の風習
壱岐島には、現地で「イチジョウ」と呼ばれる巫女がおり、ユリという曲げ物に弓をのせて二本の竹で叩きながら、百合若大臣説話を謡う風習がある。この壱岐の「百合若説経」（説経祭文）を記した文献には、後藤正足の所蔵本と、折口信夫による発表論文がある。
折口が採集した祭文によれば、百合若は桃から生まれた桃太郎（あるいはこの幼名を持つ人物）で、のちに軍隊を率いて鬼退治に加わる。
後藤本の説経祭文では、父親が九州豊後国臼杵出身の炭焼き小五郎、こと「万の長者」であったとされる。万の長者は、財産は誇るが子供がなく、「朝日の長者」という格別な金持ちではないが子宝に恵まれた者との勝負（天皇の御前での「宝くらべ」）に敗北。そこで昼夜観音堂（当本では清水観音になっている）へ願掛けし、思いがかなって百合若が生まれる。百合若の大臣は将軍の娘・輝日姫を妻にもらい受け、悪毒王（悪路王〔あくどこお〕）が君臨する鬼の国、芥満〔ケイマン〕国に鬼退治に行く。式部太夫兄弟に裏切られ芥満国の小島に置きざりになるが、その後は正本と同様に帰国を果たして仇を討つ。

五島列島・女島（男女群島）の伝承
百合若大臣が置き去りにされた島は、五島列島の南東にある女島（男女群島）であり、同島の鷹大明神は鷹の緑丸を祀ったものであると伝えられている。

水納島（沖縄県多良間村）の伝承
寝坊したために島に置き忘れられた流人の話として水納島 (沖縄県多良間村)にも伝承があり、寝坊した子供がいると「ユリワカデーズ」と言って叱った。

庄内地方の伝承
山形県八幡町（現在は酒田市）には、飛島に割拠した海賊を討伐するために派遣された百合若大臣が、飽海郡観音寺村菩提寺山に本陣を構えて出陣したが、攻撃に失敗して飛島で孤立してしまい、本陣との連絡のために鷹を放つが任務を果たすうちに衰弱して死ぬという、庄内地方に舞台をうつした百合若伝説の伝承がある。庄内の伝説での百合若大臣は都に帰着する結末や、海賊との戦いで戦死する結末など諸説ある。伝説の遺構として、飛島の高盛神社には碧丸と百合若大臣の墓と呼ばれる自然石があり、八幡町の舞鶴公園には百合若大臣の碑と呼ばれる石碑がある。一方、この諸伝説に関して『出羽国風土記』『飽海郡誌』では俗説として切り捨てている。

鷹に関する伝承
鷹の名は多く緑丸となっており、鷹王山・鷹明神などとして祀っている所も東北地方から沖縄県まで十数カ所あるという。そのうち福岡県玄界島の小鷹神社に祀られる伝説の物と称される硯も伝わっている。
宮城県名取郡の旧千貫村（現・岩沼市）にも、百合若大臣のゆかりの竜谷山鷹硯寺、緑丸石がある。仙台藩の地誌にそれらの記述が見える。鷹硯寺は、百合若の夫人に硯を託され落ちて死んだ鷹を供養した寺だと、現地に伝わる。この寺には鷹硯も保存されているという。緑丸石は、鷹の緑丸が文を届けて命尽き、石と化したと伝わる。
新潟県にも聖籠村の鷹尾観音寺の近隣の林に翠丸（みどりまる）が住みついていたという記述が『越後野志』に見え、「聖籠山観音堂二王堂建立之由緒」（1608年の写本）にも、この寺は鷹の菩提を弔うために建立されたしている。

墓に関する伝承
大分市上野丘には、大臣塚古墳という前方後円墳が築造されている。副葬品に甲冑が含まれていたため、百合若大臣説話にちなみ名づけられた。また別府市上人には、討たれた別府兄弟が、葬られる予定だったと伝承される鬼の窟屋古墳も存在する。

オデュッセイアとの類似
坪内逍遙は、古代ギリシアの詩人・ホメロスが謡った叙事詩「オデュッセイア」がなんらかの形で（あるいは室町時代にポルトガル人の手により）日本に伝えられ、それが翻案されたものこそが「百合若大臣」であるとの説を、1906年（明治39年）に『早稲田文学』誌上「百合若伝説の本源」で発表した。
オデュッセイアのラテン語での発音「ユリシス」と「百合」が似ていることや、主人公・オデュッセウスの留守を守る妻・ペネローペーが織物をして時間を稼ぎ、求婚者をかわす逸話が、百合若の妻の行いを思わせるからである。
坪内は、伝来の道筋として「いずれの国人」にもたらされたか不明であると断りながら、あるいは「堺や山口を経」たものとの思いつきに達したとする。これは室町時代にやってきた「南蛮人」・「ポルトガル人宣教師」による伝播説だと捉えられている。南蛮伝播により強く執着したのは、この坪内よりも新村出（『南蛮記』、1915年）であった。

反対派
この説は、いちどかつて津田左右吉、柳田國男、高野辰之、和辻哲郎などによって鋭く排撃されている。
反対派の主旨としては、まず、この型の説話の分布は広く、偶然の一致として懐疑的に見る意見がある。また、百合若の初演が1551年であるが、ポルトガル人による種子島銃の伝来からわずか7年あまりでそれほど完成度の高い翻案を不可能と目す論旨がある（金関丈夫など）。

賛同派
坪内との同調派には、新村出にくわえて、アメリカ出身のE・L・ヒッバード（同志社女子大学教授）があり、また日系人のジェームス・T・アラキがいる。アラキは、たとえ初演が1551年にあったとしても、1550年ごろにザビエル神父の通訳ファン・フェルナンデズによって伝承されたことは可能であると力説した。これに賛意を唱えた論文も、井本英一（2004年）や松村一男（2016年）が新たに出ている。賛同派は、『ユリシーズ』と『百合若』のみが、いくつものモチーフが段ごとに連綿として一致する酷似性があると強調する。

合成的な解釈
ただ、最古の記録が1551年というアラキ等の前提は覆されており、1514年の『雲玉和歌抄』に詳しい言及があることが今では判明しているため、ポルトガル人伝来説は困難となっている。しかし坪内逍遥や新村出の「南蛮人」伝来説をより広義的にとり、例えばアジアに到達したイスラーム教徒を媒介したものだとすれば、可能性は十分にあり、このことは既に南方熊楠に指摘されている。
そして井上章一も、逍遥の、南蛮時代に伝来したという説は成り立たないが、ユーラシア大陸全体に、前史時代に広まった説話の一つと見るのが妥当だろうとしている。中央ユーラシアの叙事詩『アルパムス』と類似しており、これがユリシーズ伝説との中間的な媒体だった可能性も指摘されている。甲賀三郎伝説も、これと同じようなアジア経由をたどったのでは大林太良などは推察する。
また源義経には義経=ジンギスカン説が知られ、モンゴルとの関連ということで百合若と共通するが、松村一男などは、義経を主人公とする『御曹司島渡』と『百合若大臣』の類似を指摘する。

概要
日本において、非業の死を遂げた歴史上の人物が死地を脱して逃げ延びたとされる伝説は数多く、その代表例として、源為朝の琉球渡来伝説、朝比奈義秀の高麗落ち伝説と並び称されるのが、義経入夷伝説又は義経蝦夷渡り伝説である（他に他戸親王・源義親・高倉宮・安徳天皇・公暁・大塔宮・豊臣秀頼・西郷隆盛など）。
『吾妻鏡』によれば、源義経は文治5年閏4月30日（1189年6月15日）に奥州衣川の館で自刃したとされるが、その不遇の死への同情から、生きていて欲しいという人々の願望、実は生きて逃亡したのではないかという疑念や期待が「義経生脱伝説」を生んだ。
室町時代以降、軍記物語によって醸成された判官びいきと義経生脱説が「御曹子島渡」説話と結びつき、新たな伝説を生む。江戸時代初期に出版された『義経記』元和木活字本が広く流布、続く寛永年間でも流布本がでまわり、以降、「判官もの」として浄瑠璃・歌舞伎・狂言・読本等でもさかんに題材とされるなかで、義経は自刃したとみせかけて蝦夷地に渡ったとする義経入夷伝説（義経北行伝説）が生まれた。以降、様々な創作と虚説、あるいは捏造書が生み出された。
江戸時代の知識人層でも義経の死については疑義が示され、首級の搬送期間が明らかに長いことから、水戸藩編纂『大日本史』では偽の死で北へ逃亡した可能性が注記された。朱子学者・新井白石も義経の搬送された首は偽だろうと記した。明治期になると、帝国大学文科大学教授らが『吾妻鏡』を根拠に義経自刃を史実とし、以降現代に至るまで歴史学上は義経生脱・入夷説は否定されている。
一方、民間では創作や捏造が肥大化、江戸時代中期以降、義経は蝦夷地のアイヌたちの棟梁、大陸の金国の将軍、さらには清国の祖とされた。この義経＝清祖説は、夏目漱石『吾輩は猫である』でも触れられているように、江戸から明治期まで庶民にとっても耳馴染みの言説だった。明治期には、さらに義経＝成吉思汗説が浮上することとなるが、大正末期に出版された小谷部全一郎『成吉思汗は源義経なり』が戦地で配布されたように、同説は「満蒙は国家の生命線」（松岡洋右）とする帝国日本の国家戦略と軌を一にして、昭和期の大陸侵略に利用された。
義経の死を疑う論拠は多数あり、義経の行方不明後に、テムジンはハーンを宣言、後にチンギス・ハンとなっている。後述するように遊牧民族、騎馬民族の集団は、世襲・序列などにこだわらず、優秀な人材と信じた者を指導者に選び、場合によっては人種の違いさえも厭わないという事実等を論拠に、同一人物説を主張する人々は特に東北・北海道地方に根強く存在し、それを否定する知識人・歴史家との対立も長い歴史をもっている。
ただし、現代では学術的に否定されている。チンギス・ハンは家系がはっきりしており、日本人の噂や伝説は現在の所ない。また日本からモンゴル高原までは相当な距離があり、後にチンギス・ハンに倒されるまで大陸沿岸に存在した強大な金国（女真族）を通過するには言語・軍資面などの疑問も多い。チンギス・ハンが大量殺戮を行った点などの行動・性格が違いすぎることも含め、物理的にも史的観点からもこの説の立証は難しい。

歴史
六回蘇った義経
源義経復活譚は、『成吉思汗ハ源義經也』が最初ではない。義経生脱説は日本の中世から近代にかけて、たびたび巷間に浮上してきた。

正徳2年（1712年）義経は衣川で死なず、蝦夷地へ脱出。義経は神として崇められ、子孫はアイヌの棟梁になった。
享保2年（1717年）義経は蝦夷へ脱出後、韃靼（沿海州・中国北部）を支配していた金国へ渡り、皇帝章宗から厚遇され子孫も栄えた（『鎌倉実記』）。
明和年間（1764-72年）義経は蝦夷から韃靼に渡った。その子孫が繁栄、のちに清国を建国した。
明治18年（1885年）義経は蝦夷から韃靼を経てモンゴルへ至り、成吉思汗となった（『義経再興記』）。
大正13年（1924年）小谷部の『成吉思汗ハ源義経也』によって義経＝成吉思汗説が空前のブームになる。
義経生脱説は江戸中期の勃興から300年間囁かれ続けてきたことになる。

義経入夷伝説始まる
『吾妻鏡』では、源義経は兄頼朝に追討され、奥州平泉で藤原泰衡らに襲われ自刃したとされるが、実は生きて蝦夷に落ち延びたとする噂や伝説は江戸時代初期にはあった。寛文7年（1667年）、江戸幕府の巡見使一行が蝦夷地を視察し、アイヌのオキクルミの祭祀を目撃。中根宇右衛門（幕府小姓組番）は帰府後、アイヌ社会ではオキクルミが「判官殿」と呼ばれ、その屋敷が残っていたと何度も証言した。さらに奥の地（樺太・シベリア）へ向かったとの伝承もあったと報告する。

（松前藩の案内人の報告）
寛文10年（1670年）に林羅山・鵞峰親子が幕命で編纂した歴史書『続本朝通鑑』では、「俗伝」として衣川で義経は死なず脱出して蝦夷へ渡り子孫を残したという旨を明記した。その後、徳川将軍家宣に仕えた儒学者・新井白石は『読史余論』（正徳2年・1712年）、更に『蝦夷志』で言及。徳川光圀編纂『大日本史』でも注釈扱いで、泰衡が送った義経の首は判別不能で、義経は逃れたかもしれず、蝦夷では神として祀られている旨が記された。広く読まれた馬場信意による通俗軍書『義経勲功記』（正徳2年）では、義経は蝦夷の棟梁になり、シャクシャインは義経の子孫として描かれた。

杉目太郎行信の伝説
義経は頼朝に追われ奥州へ落ち延びたあと、杉目太郎行信（すぎのめたろうゆきのぶ）という義経そっくりの人物と遭った。奥州の藤原秀衡のもとで青年期を過ごし、日々の鍛錬を共に過ごした仲であった。泰衡は義経を呼び「蝦夷ヶ島（北海道）へ落ち延びよさもないと討つ」と打ち明け、義経も泰衡の胸中を察し高館退去を決意したが、行信は「館に人がいなければ逃亡したことが明らか」とし、当地に留まり、義経の鎧、兜などを形見に所望し、義経平泉退去の2日後、泰衡の高館襲撃で行信は身代わりとなった。当地に残る伝説。

義経、韃靼へ渡り金の将軍になる
義経入夷伝説は飛躍して大陸へ渡る。当初は室町時代の御伽草子『御曹子島渡』の影響が強かったが、寛永20年（1643年）の越前国新保船漂流事件以降、義経が大陸へ渡ったとする説が囁かれるようになる。大陸入部説の比較的古い例は、延宝年間（1673-81）以降の成立とされる、京都養源院の住職（津軽藩主の子）が記した『可足記』。

私的日記の記述で、この頃はまだ一部の知識人間での話題であったと思われる。

その後享保年間（18世紀前半）に注目されたのが『金史別本』で、12世紀の金国の将軍に源義経の子・義鎮がいたなどと記された偽書である。享保2年（1717年）、この『金史別本』が史学界で話題になり、新井白石は偽書と見抜いた。しかし、印刷技術及び出版流通も未発達な時期に同書の記述は後代まで影響し、他にも類似の偽書（架空の書）が多数創作された。

義経、清国の祖とされる
渡金説は効力を失ったが、寛政4年（1792年）、蝦夷地を訪れた和算家・串原正峯（せいほう）は、『夷諺俗話（いおんぞくばなし）』第一巻で、「密に蝦夷地へ落行」した義経の武威に蝦夷人が恐れ服し、「夫より金国へ渡りたまひしよし云伝る事なり」と記しており、蝦夷地にまで金に渡ったという流言が広がっていたことが窺える。また、延享3年（1746年）の跋を有する俳人米山沾涼による説話集『本朝俗諺志（ぞくげんし）』巻四の「高舘城」には、義経が樺太で農耕と文字を教えて国王となり源国を建てたとする話があり、初めは金国の臣下に留まっていた義経は、国王にまで祭り上げられる。明和5年（1766年）刊の滕英勝（とうえいしょう）の小説『通俗義経蝦夷軍談』では白石『蝦夷志』の知識に頼りつつ、筋立ては義経が蝦夷軍との戦いに勝利する過程が描かれ、ついには清国の祖とされた。衣川で義経の死は諸書で歴然とし、「義経金へ渡りしという説あれどもその証慥（たし）かならず」と渡金説を否定しながら、清で門毎に貼られている義経の画像を確かな証拠とし、「今中国の天子は義経の子孫なりと伝えり」と断定するに至る。さらに世上の話題となったのは、天明3年（1783年）年刊の森長見『国学忘貝（わすれがい）』である。同書巻下では、輸入された清朝の一万巻の『古今図書集成』中に130巻からなる『図書輯勘』があり、その序文に、

と、ある儒者が書いていると紹介したが、これも捏造であった。
義経が金の将軍になったり、松浦静山の『甲子夜話』（文政4・1821年）及び『甲子夜話続編』などにみられるように、江戸後期の庶民の間では「義経が韃靼に渡り、その子孫が清和源氏の一字をとって清国を興した」とする説が幕末まで一般的であった。なお、通俗小説の世界では、嘉永3年（1850年）の永楽舎一水『義経蝦夷軍談』に義経が成吉思汗になったとする話もあったという。

そして成吉思汗に
最初にチンギス・カンは義経であるとの論陣を張ったのは日本人ではなく、フィリップ・フランツ・フォン・シーボルトであった。文政6年（1823年）に来日したシーボルトは、長崎の鳴滝塾などに多くの門弟を集めて洋学の発展に尽くしたが、いわゆるシーボルト事件によって同12年（1829年）に国外追放となった。日蘭修好通商条約締結を機に、翌安政6年（1859年）年に再来日を果たして活動、文久2年（1862年）に帰国した。
吉雄忠次郎に義経＝成吉思汗説を聞いてから、風説にすぎなかった同説に文献的裏付けを得るため、『日本』執筆時に白石の『蝦夷志』を、フランス語訳マルテ・ブリューン編『地理及び歴史に関する探検旅行紀集』第24巻を介して読んだという。文久3年（1863年）の松浦武四郎『西蝦夷日誌』二編によれば、蕃書調所の大島高任から次のような話を訊いたとされる。

蕃書調書の西周も明治2年（1869年）稿『末広の寿』でも書かれているように、シーボルトは再来日した際に洋学者たちに切々とこの説を吹聴した。しかし近世中には義経の韃靼行は広く信じられていたものの韃靼は満州近辺と認識されており、義経＝清祖説が一般的だった。『蝦夷志』でも義経の韃靼行と清祖説には触れているが、元祖説には至っていない。シーボルトは韃靼をモンゴル即ち元と解釈し、義経＝ジンギスカン説として発表したが、殆ど信じてもらえなかった。

明治初期、アメリカ人教師グリフィスが影響を受け、その書The Mikado's Empire（皇国）, 1876 で同説に言及。末松謙澄の英語論文の翻訳本『義経再興記』（1885年）及び大正13年（1924年）の小谷部全一郎『成吉思汗ハ源義經也』の2書は公刊後に各々ベストセラーとなり、多くの信奉者を生んだ。しかし言語学者・岩崎克己は義経がチンギス・カンになったという説はシーボルトが最初で、その論文の影響が非常に大きいとしている。
同説に対しては、当初実証主義を旨とする帝国大学文科大学教授らが中心となって批判し、さらに欧米から移入された「東洋学 Oriental Studies」の概念に基づいて創設された「東洋史」分野の学者等からの批判反論も加わった。しかし否定されつつも東北・北海道では今も義経北行説を信じる者が根強く存在している。戦後、高木彬光が昭和33年（1958年）に歴史推理小説『成吉思汗の秘密』を著して人気を得たが、世間の関心は薄れ、生脱説や同一人物説は民俗学や文学における説話・伝承研究以外、学界で取り扱われることはなくなった。

この説が興った要因
義経の首の搬送期間
『吾妻鏡』によれば、文治5年閏4月30日（1189年6月15日）、源義経は衣川の館において藤原泰衡の手勢の襲撃を受け自刃、泰衡による義経誅殺の報告が源頼朝に届いたのは襲撃から22日後であった。義経の首も黒漆の櫃に酒に浸され鎌倉へ搬送されたが、鶴岡八幡の塔供養という慶事が予定されていたため一旦留め置かれ、首実検までに43日を要した。このタイムラグと時季的に腐敗は免れず義経本人か判別不能だったのではという疑念が、実は義経は生き延び逃げたのではないかという憶測を生むこととなった。後世の史家もその死を疑い、水戸藩編纂『大日本史』でも義経は死を偽装し逃亡したのではないかと注記された。また、『吾妻鏡』には義経自刃の記述に関わらず、その8か月後に義経及び義仲・秀衡の子らが反乱という奥州からの風説が記され、実際に反乱が起きた（大河兼任の乱）。中津義彦は義経の死を断定していたのなら、何故反乱の第一報（風説）の段階から「義経と号し」と記さなかったのか疑問が残り、当時も義経の死に大きな疑惑があったのは間違いなく、奥州では誰も信じてはいなかったと主張している。

判官びいき説
治承・寿永の乱は、源平合戦であると同時に王朝国家に対する武士の組織立った抵抗ないし自立化を熱望するという側面を産み、この抵抗を通じて東国政権である鎌倉幕府を成立させるに至った。その組織の頂点にあったのが征夷大将軍となった源頼朝であり、梶原景時はその良き補佐役、そして義経に付された軍監であったが、義経は兄頼朝の名代であり、武士でありながら、兄の軍律に違反し、武士の抵抗の相手で有るはずの朝廷から官位を兄の許可無く任じられるなどして、頼朝から怒りを買い殺されてしまう。のちに語られた『平家物語』や『源平盛衰記』、『義経記』などを通じて、後世の庶民は頼朝を権力者、景時を讒言者、義経を悲劇の英雄と見立てた。このような見立ての上に、反権力という立場からの共感、中傷・讒言者への憎しみ、冷酷な兄に対する健気な弟に対する同情、あるいは「滅びの美学」とも呼ぶべき独特の美意識が加わって、判官びいきが生まれた。王朝国家の側に立つ畿内の文化人の多くが義経びいきだったことも、こうした風潮を後押ししたものと考えられる。　「判官贔屓」を参照

説話による影響説
室町時代以降、いわゆる判官びいきと義経生脱説とが御伽草子の説話と結びつき、蝦夷渡り伝説を生むこととなる。江戸時代初期、軍記物語『義経記』は元和木活字本により広く流布、寛永年間の流布本によって本格的に読まれるようになり、「判官もの」として浄瑠璃・歌舞伎・狂言・読本などの題材にもされるなかで、義経生脱説と「御曹子島渡」説話が結びつき、義経は自刃したとみせかけて、実は蝦夷地に渡ったという義経入夷伝説（北行伝説）が生み出された。

両者の前半生は不明
源義経の前半生は不明
源義経について誤解されているのは、「牛若丸」などの話は創作で、幼少期の史料は皆無であり、その前半生は不明ということである。義経の幼年期を記した軍記物語『平治物語』は創作で、史料としては扱えない。史学的にはっきりしているのは、治承4年（1180年）10月21日、この時22歳で黄瀬川の陣中で頼朝と相会してからで、それまでどこで何をしていたのかまったく不明の人物である。この時兄弟の名乗りをし、感激の涙の再会をしながら、その後3年間は行方知れずとなっている。兄に重用されることもなかったが、寿永2年（1183年）10月、25歳の義経が頼朝の命を受け木曽義仲追討のため京へ向かい、ここで再び歴史に現れ、27歳まで武将の名をほしいままにしたが、勝手に朝廷から官職を与えられるなどして頼朝の不興を買って不和となり、文治2年（1186年）に京から偽山伏に扮し北陸路あるいは別路で追討を逃れ、文治5年（1189年）に陸奥平泉で没するまでの、21歳から30歳までのわずか9年間しか判っていないというの現状である（上述の通り3年は行方不明）。
腰越状で通説とは異なることを述べている点などから、一説にはこの人物は偽なのではないかという異論まであり、作家・歴史研究家の高木浩明、二階堂玲太、椎野健二朗らは、奥州藤原氏が鎌倉幕府に襲われないために、偽の人物を頼朝の弟として擁立したのではないかと疑っている。勿論これは学説では肯定されていない。

チンギス・ハンも前半生が謎
チンギス・ハンについても生年や前半生が不明な点が多い。モンゴル民族が元来文字を持たなかったため、口伝・口承によるものと僅かな文献が残っておらず、青年時に約10年行方不明になっているが、この空白期間に何をしていたのかは歴史学者も特定できていない。チンギス・ハン即位前のテムジン時代、妻のボルテをメルキト族に奪われたり、テムジン本人の母ホエルンもイェスゲイによって略奪されており、遊牧・騎馬民族は略奪婚が多かった事実から、系譜の正当性については文献が遺されていないのも手伝って不確定な要素が多い。杉山正明及び岡田英弘もチンギス・ハンの前半生はよくわからないと述べている。また江上波夫によれば、たとえ血縁がなくとも実力さえあれば氏・部族長らによって君主として推戴・承認を受けられたとし、日本人でもなれる可能性を示唆している。また、作家・中津文彦は遊牧・騎馬民族の集団は、世襲・序列などにこだわず、優秀な人材と信じた者を指導者に選び、場合によっては人種の違いさえも厭わず、チンギス・ハンがモンゴル族の出身でなかったこともその証左である、としている。

偽本（捏造書）の存在
金史別本について
金史別本（金史列将伝）とは
享保2年（1717年）、医師・加藤謙斎による『鎌倉実記』全17巻が刊行されると、引用書目に掲げられた『金史別本』なる史書が注目を浴びた。金国の正史『金史』（全135巻・1344年成立）の異本を意味したが、加藤は『鎌倉実記』最終巻の末尾に「高館没落義経金国に遁（のがるる）事」との項をたて、『金史別本』中の列将伝の一節として、以下の通り引用した（全文）。

「金史列将伝ニ曰　金史別本　範車国ノ大将軍源光録義鎮ハ、日東ノ陸華仙権冠者義行（義経を指す：引用者注）ノ子也、始メ新靺鞨部ニ入リ、千戸邦ノ判事ト為ル、身ノ長六尺七寸、性温和ニシテ勇猛、才思諸部ニ甲タリ、外夷多ク随フ、拝シテ学館ニ入リ礼義ヲ弁ズ、後チ咸京録事ニ遷ル、章宗詔シテ光録大夫ニ転ズ、累リニ大将軍ニ任ズ、久ク範車城ヲ守リ北方ヲ押ス、往昔権冠者（義経を指す）東小洋ノ藩君、章宗顧厚賞、総軍曹事ノ官ニ定メ、北鉱ニ入ラ令メ、不日蘇敵ヲ破ル、印府ヲ得テ、翻リ来リ幕下ニ属ス、範車ヲ築キ護ル焉、頃北天ヲ侵シ、龍海ヲ渡リ、一ノ嶋ヲ得タリ、山河麗奇ニシテ悉ク金玉也、民霊草ヲ煎ズルコトヲ知テ、少ク五穀ヲ食フ、生肉ヲ屠ルヲ甚ダ嫌フ、故ニ邪煩無ク、老仙伊香保ノ行辰本命ノ法ヲ行フ、儀相異怪無シ、徳故人ニ勝レル、義行帰趣シテ尊敬シ長寿ヲ得タリ、後チ中華ニ遊テ隠顕更ニ定ラズ」（原文は漢文）

さらに自注（私見）として、以下のように追記した。

「…蝦夷ハ金ノ地続キニシテ一名ヲ毛人女直トイフ金ノ本名ヲ女真トモ女直トモイヘリ俗説ニ蝦夷人義経ヲ信敬スル神ノ如シイカサマニモ蝦夷ヲ従ヘテ後ニ金ニ渡リ章宗ニ仕ヘ玉フナルヘシ」

金史列将伝にある範車国大将軍「源光録義鎮」とは、「権冠者義行」つまり義経の子で、義経自身も章宗に仕えていたという。
2年後、仙台藩史を編纂した儒者・佐久間洞巌は、『奥羽観蹟聞老志（かんせきもんろうし）』巻17「義経事実考附録」で別本を引用、義経が金に渡ったことは「異国の書に符合すれば決定疑うべからず」とした。
洞巌と文通交流のあった新井白石は、『金史別本』の記述について疑問を挟みつつもかなりの興味を抱いた。白石は水戸藩の儒者・安積澹泊への書簡で、「金逸史の事…誰某（たれがし）見候とばかりにて、写しも得られず候の事、俗人の疎放にやと、是非に及ばず候」（享保8年7月12日・1723年）としつつも、別の書簡には、「金史に義経の事候由、いかにもいかにも六七年以前に、此方へも僧家（そうけ）事候て、金史一行も残らず暮らせたる事に候、兎角見え候わぬ故、伝聞の訛（あやまり）と打ち捨てさし置き候らいき」と記したが、入手できそうだと聞くと写しを所望した（『新安書簡』『新井白石全集5』所収)。
白石は別本を疑い、全体の拙さから即座に謀書であることを見抜き、年月日未詳の書簡では以下のように憤った。

「地名官号はさておき、文字の拙き、一句として見るに足るべくも候所もなく覚候、世にはかかる妄人も候て、世をたぶらかし人を欺き候事、いかなる事に候歟」

一方、儒者・篠崎東海も『金史別本』を疑った一人で、元文5年（1740年）刊『東海談』巻上で、同書に対して痛烈な批判を行っている。東海は偽書の作者は中根丈右衛門の知音（友人）とし、さらに

「鎌倉実記の編末に、金史別本と云書を引て書たるは、跡形もなき空言也、予金史別本と云は偽書也と知て中根丈右衛門と論じて偽作せし人を屈服せしめたり、中根氏も是に我を折し也」

と、中根を介して「偽作せし人」を屈服させたとしている。
これが徐々に知れ渡り諸書で『金史別本』批判がおこなわれた。佐久間洞厳の弟子で仙台藩医・相原友直は『平泉雑記』巻一の「義経蝦夷へ渡る」で詳細に史料を吟味し、史料は『吾妻鏡』によるべきとし、異国で義行という名を名乗ることや日東陸華仙などという地名はないと反論し、『鎌倉実記』は人々を欺く偽書と批判した。
明治期、この偽書について金田一京助は、永田方正による「『鎌倉実記』と『金史別本』の作者は沢田源内」という考証を踏襲し、沢田源内を捏造者と断定した（京華日報社『世界』75号所収）。作家光瀬龍もこの金田一説を支持し、NHKのテレビ番組で論説した（歴史発見）。

偽撰者は沢田源内か
永田方正・金田一京助の説に従えば、『金史別本』の作者は沢田源内で、篠崎東海のいう中根丈右衛門の友人も沢田ということになるが、断定するには難点がある。
『大系図評判遮中抄』によれば、沢田源内は元禄元年（1688年）年に70歳で病没したとされている。逆算すれば元和年間（1615-24）初期の生まれとなるが、伊勢貞丈『安斎随筆』の「澤田源内」に、沢田は既に慶長年間（1596-1615）に捏造活動をしていたとされ、元禄元年と70歳没という数字のどちらかが怪しくなるが、そもそも篠崎東海は貞享4年（1687年）生まれなので一世代ずれがあり、篠崎の記述が事実であるならば、彼が屈服させたのは沢田ではないと推定される。
岩崎克己は、『鎌倉実記』の著者加藤謙斎を金史別本の偽撰者と断定し、金田一は義行傳（金史別本）の偽作は沢田源内に胚胎するもので、『鎌倉実記』を沢田の偽作としたが、永田方正の誤解をさらに誤解したものと評した。「沢田源内を加藤謙斎に置き換えると謙斎は享保9年（1724年）の春に没しているから、多少現実味を帯びてくる。沢田源内が『金史別本』の偽撰者とするには根拠がなく、『和学弁』（東海談）記載に従い『鎌倉実記』の著者（謙斎）に当てるのが自然の順序である。金田一博士の説のごとく『鎌倉実記がまずまんまと騙されて、麗々とその偽作の文句を引用した』のではなく、騙したのは『鎌倉実記』そのものであり、偽作の『金史別本』は『鎌倉実記』の著者加藤謙斎その人の創作なのである」。
作家・森村宗冬は、金史別本捏造の大ペテン師のような印象を持つが、加藤謙斎の実像は教育者にして医学者であり、医学・儒学・本草学・詩文に通じ、京都で医業を営む傍ら多くの門人を育成、『日用療法』などの医学書も書いている。贋作作成を生活手段としているならいざ知らず、地位・教養を身につけている加藤が本当に偽撰者か疑問視している。

図書輯勘・輯勘録・大清会典副本など
岩崎克己の研究によれば、『金史別本』の他、『図書輯勘』、『大清会典』副本などの捏造書があるという。例えば、国学者・森長見による『国学忘貝（わすれがい）』（天明3年・1783年）では、清朝が編纂した1万巻の百科事典『古今図書集成』のなかに『図書輯勘』130巻があり、清帝自身による序の略文として、

「朕姓源義経之裔其先出清和故号国清トアリ清ト号スルハ清和帝ノ清ナリト或儒考ヲ加ヘ書ルヲ前年見テ不審ナリシ…」

森長見自身は「不審」に思い、実際に古今図書集成は輸入され官庫に納められたことは確認したが、上記序文の存否は不明とした。また、5年後に刊行された峻諦『浄土真宗名目図』（天明8年・1788年）では、『十八史略』から引用した「震且世記」という中国王朝の系統図の末尾に、以下のような注が記された。

「明和三年五月新渡図書集成六百套。九千九百九十六巻。清蒋天錫奉勅挟定。中有輯勘録三十巻。第三十序云。乾隆皇帝述。我姓源義経裔。其先清和姓源故国号清姓源。出伊藤才蔵之記。」

同様の話題はすでに、儒者・戸部愿山『韓川筆話』（明和6年・1769年）は、「『古今図書集成』中に清朝皇帝の先祖は源義経」と記されているとした。また俳人・蓑笠庵梨一の『奥細道管菰抄（すがごもしょう）』（安永7年・1778年）では、「衣川」の解説文に「今ノ中華ハ韃靼人ノ治ニテ世ヲ清ト云其ノ先ハ義経ヲ祖トス故ニ世号モ亦清和源氏ノ清ヲ取ト乃チ清朝ニテ撰述セシ図書大成ト云書ニ載スト聞ヌ」という同門の俳人神谷玄武坊からの伝聞を紹介し、これは清朝王城下の門戸に義経の画像が掲げられているという白石の蝦夷志の記述と符合し、「義経高館ニ死セズ蝦夷ヲ経テ中華ニ渡ルコトハ実ニシテ明カナリ」とした。
従って、それぞれ記述に若干差異があるが、義経＝清朝先祖説は18世紀後半に集中的に広まっていたことが知られる。一方、幕臣・伊勢貞丈は『古今図書集成』の序文の写しを見る機会に恵まれたが、「義経先祖」の文言はなく、『安斎随筆』巻5において「巷で囁かれている『古今図書集成』云々の話は大嘘である」と怒りを露わにした。医師・桂川中良はこの話題に強い関心を持ち、兄・桂川甫周の力を借りて紅葉山文庫所蔵『古今図書集成』を閲覧したが、初巻、蔣廷錫（しょうていしゃく）の表文、いずれも「義経」の記述はなく、総目録に『図書輯勘』そのものがなかったという旨を『桂林漫録』（寛政12年・1800年）に記した。
岩崎克己は、「古く伊藤蘭嵎（才蔵）の名が引き合いに出されているところから見て、京都がこの説の発展に重大な寄与をしていることは推察に難くない。しかし更に遡れば実在の本書に何らかの関わり合いを持った者の空想がこれに参画していたのではなかったか」として、『古今図書集成』が輸入された際、長崎か江戸で検閲に当たった書物改役が解題（書物・絵などの解説）のついでに捏造した可能性を指摘している。

虚説の広まり
文久2年（1862年）版の『倭訓栞』中編巻28「よしつね」項では、『鎌倉実記』の「金史別本」を引用した上で偽作とし、さらに長崎年寄で書物改役・後藤貞栄（さだえ）と思われる人物の説として、「清を清和の清にて義経の末といふこと図書集成にも見えず金史も亦いぶかし」とし、また北京南門の扉に描かれた「甲冑よろへる武者」は清朝太祖とされるが、それを見て帰った邦人は義経に似ていたというので、来日した清人に改めて聞いたところ、長崎諏訪社の義経弓流しの絵馬のようなものだと答えたという（『増補語林倭訓栞』皇典講究所）。
医師・橘南谿『北窓瑣談』は、寛政年間（1789-1801）の記事を中心とするが、後編巻一には「往年唐土より大清会典といふ書を関東に献ぜし事の有し其中に今の清朝は清和源氏の流れにして、源義経の末裔なる事を載せたり」という伝聞を記し、それは後年差し戻されたその書物の「副本一部」を長崎の唐通詞神代氏が家蔵し、それを常に見ていた息子・太仲が京で南谿に物語った話とした。続けて木村兼葭堂によれば、以前所持していた『大清会典』をある諸侯に献上したが、清和源氏のことは見覚えがないというので、恐らく「虚説」で太仲が幼少の頃の出来事なので「見誤り」だろうとした。
また、尾張藩の儒者・恩田蕙楼（けいろう）の『竈北瑣語』では、「香祖筆記」と題する項に「…義経海を航して北夷に入り、蒙古別部に居て子孫相続し、後世強大になり、明を滅ぼし、天下を掌握し、国号を清と呼ぶといふこと、香祖筆記といふ書にみへたるよし、或る人かたりき」と伝え、松前広長の『夷酋列像附録』（寛政2・1790年）にも、「清朝撰するところの図書集成中に、源延尉韃靼に到れるよしをのせたりとぞ」云々とあり、松前藩家老を務めた文人までも不確かな伝聞を記した。
さらに、江戸後期の国学者・伴信友（本居宣長の養子大平に師事）は、『中外経緯伝草稿』第2巻（天保9年・1838年）にて、熊本の国学者・中島広足によれば、長崎の唐通詞・水野某が唐商・江芸閣に、清国の王は義経の子孫で図書集成にも徴があるという一説について尋ねたところ、浅学でその書は知らぬが清王の祖は貴国より出たという俗説があり、それは玉牒天潢世系という書に見えると友人に聞いたことがある、という二重の又聞き伝聞を紹介した（但し、直後に図書集成の件は「大偽なり」という先人の見解を注記）。
一般には、『鎌倉実記』『国学忘貝』そのものや、その批判書を読むことなく清祖＝義経とする虚説、伝聞が広く浸透していたと思われる。

義経入夷伝説以降を論じた人々
本朝通鑑など
江戸幕府の命で林鵞峰（林羅山の三男）が編纂し、寛文10年（1670年）に完成した『続本朝通鑑』巻79には、泰衡に攻められた義経が自害した記事がある。末尾には「俗伝」として様々な俗説が書かれており、その中には弁慶の立ち往生などと並んで、「俗傳又曰、衣河之役義経不死、逃到蝦夷島存其遺種」（俗に伝えるところでは、義経は衣川の戦いで死せず、逃れて蝦夷島に至り、その後裔が今に残る）という記述がある。また、元禄3年（1690年）刊行の南宗庵『残太平記』では、巻七「罪人遠島流刑評定之事」に「文治五年伊与守義経奥州衣川高館ノ城ニテ自害ト云ヘ共、死間ノ謀（ハカリゴト）ヲ以テ、義経弁慶夷嶋（エゾガシマ）ニ渡テ方便ヲ尽シ給ヒシカバ、夷人（エゾジン）大ニ尊ミ今ノ世マデモ義経大明神ト祭リ崇メテ、日本ノ伊勢大神宮ノ如ク恐レヲ成ス、是レ一ノ奇特ナリ。此嶋ヨリ韃靼国ヘハ、海路六十里ヲ阻テ通路ヨシト語リケル、是可慎嶋（ツツシムベキシマ）ナリ、罪人ヲ流ス共国広ケレバ、如何成謀ヲヤ成ベキ」と伝えられた。

徳川光圀
水戸藩第2代藩主・徳川光圀は義経入夷説に執着し、『大日本史』編纂事業では、その一環として調査団を組織、快風丸を建造して蝦夷地に派遣した。貞享2年（1685年）、元禄元年2月（1688年3月）など、数回にわたって航海が行われたが、同説を裏付けるほどの結果は得られなかったが、蝦夷地に義経・弁慶にちなんだ地名があること、義経がアイヌ民からオキクルミ（狩猟や農耕をアイヌに教えた神）として崇められていると報告した。1906年（明治39年）に完成した『大日本史』巻187列伝114「源義経」においては、義経の首の搬送期間が長かったことも当時から不審に思われており、義経は死を偽って逃亡したのではないかと注記された。

「世に伝ふ、義経衣川館に死せずして、遁れて蝦夷に至ると。今東鑑を考ふるに、閏四月己未（新暦6月15日：引用者注）、藤原泰衡義経を襲ひて之を殺す。五月辛巳（新暦7月7日）、報至り、将に首を鎌倉へ致さんとせしが、時に源頼朝鶴岡の浮圖（仏塔）を慶したり。故に（泰衡へ）使を遣はして之（首の鎌倉搬送）を止む。六月辛丑（新暦7月27日）、泰衡が使者、首を斎して腰越に至り、漆函もて之（首）を盛り、浸すに美酒を以てす。頼朝、和田義盛、梶原景時をして之を検せしむと。己未より辛丑に至るまで、相距ること四十三日。天、時に暑熱なり、函して酒に浸したりと雖も、焉ぞ壊爛腐敗せざることを得ん。孰れか能く其の真偽を弁ぜんや。然らば則ち義経は偽り死して遁れ去りしか。今に至るまで夷人義経を崇奉し、祀りて之を神となせり。蓋し或はその故あらん」（原文は漢文）

「松前城下より下ったサルという地に、陸行で九日の距離で、源義経公が上陸した場所と伝えられています。
伝承によれば、義経公はアイヌでサルを統治していた大将の婿になり、サルに程近いハヘという屋敷を構えたそうです。その後、大将の宝物を盗んで本土に引き返したそうです。アイヌの言葉で義経公はウキクルミ、弁慶をシャマニイクルと呼んでいます。蝦夷で昔から伝承されていますが、真偽の程は判りません」元禄元年の快風丸調査報告

新井白石
6代将軍家宣の侍講を務めた儒者・新井白石は『読史余論』（正徳2年・1712年）で、アイヌ民話のなかには、小柄で頭のよい神オキクルミ神と大男で強力無双の従者サマイクルに関するものがあり、この主従を義経と弁慶に同定する説のあったことを紹介、当時の蝦夷各地の民間信仰として頻繁にみられた「ホンカン様」信仰は義経を意味する「判官様」が転じたものと分析したが、義経が蝦夷から韃靼に渡り金の将軍になったという噂の金史別本を読み安積澹泊宛にそれが偽物であるとの手紙を書き、義経蝦夷脱出に関しては断定を避けた。古くから義経の入夷説はアイヌの間にも広まっていたが、更に千島、もしくは韃靼へ逃げ延びたという説も行われ、白石は同書の中で『吾妻鏡』を信用すべきかと云いながら、幾つかの疑問点を示し、義経の死については入夷説を長々と紹介し、更に入韃靼説も付記している。また、『蝦夷志』（享保5年・1720年）でも同様の主張をし、これが長崎出島のオランダ商館長イサーク・ティチングに翻訳され、欧米に紹介された。ただし、白石は義経の韃靼行には触れているが、全面的に肯定しているわけではない。

「義経手ヲ束ネテ死ニ就ベキ人ニアラズ、不審ノ事ナリ。今モ蝦夷ノ地ニ義経家跡アリ。マタ夷人飲食ニ必マツルモノ、イハユル『オキクルミ』ト云フハ即義経ノ事ニテ、義経後ニハ奥ヘ行シナド云伝ヘシトモ云フ也」（読史余論）

「俗尤敬神、而不設祠壇、其飲食所祭者源廷尉義経也、東部有廷尉居止之墟、土人最好勇、夷中皆畏之（夷俗凡飲食乃祝之曰オキクルミ、問之則曰判官、判官蓋其所謂オキクルミ、夷中所称廷尉之言也、廷尉居止之地名曰ハイ、夷中所称ハイクル、即其地方人也、西部地名亦有弁慶崎者、或伝廷尉去此而踰北海云、寛永間、越前国神保人、漂至韃靼地、是歳癸未、清主乃率其人、而入于燕京、居歳余、勅遣朝鮮送到而還、其人曰、奴児干部門戸之神、似此間画廷尉像者亦可以為異聞）」（蝦夷志：句点は引用者）

原田信男は、新井白石は『蝦夷志』で義経が韃靼に渡ったと推論しているとし、安積澹泊との往復書簡でも微妙な立場をとり続け、白石と澹泊は文献重視の立場から義経自殺説を真っ向から否定できなかったが、心情的には生き延びて蝦夷地に渡った説にしたかったのだろうと述べている。

神沢杜口
江戸中期の俳人・神沢杜口は『翁草（おきなぐさ）』巻28「諸録抜萃」で金史別本を引用、巻177「国学忘貝抜萃」でも偽説を抜粋した。そして巻186「清朝天子源義経裔の説再考」では、そもそも清朝は北の蛮族であるからそれを恥じても「天子自ら図書輯勘に序して日本の裔と称せらるる事、我朝の美名、万世に伝えて、吾が國の光明たり」と記し、先の「国学忘貝抜萃」では、「（義経が）西土を掌握し有し事、実に快然たる哉」と感想を述べている。
原田信男は、「金史別本」「図書輯勘」を捏造してまでも義経を大陸での英雄に仕立て上げたかったのかと驚嘆し、まさに近世後期の多くの知識人たちは、義経伝説を「美しい歴史」へと転換させようとしていると述べている。

古川古松軒と菅江真澄
江戸中期の旅行家・古川古松軒は、天明8年（1788年）に幕府巡見使随員として蝦夷地を訪れた。寛政元年（1789年）敲の『東遊雑記』巻七で、「義経公主従数人ソウヤ（宗谷：引用者注）より夷人を召連満州の地に渡り給ひ、韃靼国迄もゆき給ふと」いう伝承について尋ねたが、「さしての言伝へ」もなかったとし、「予が考には、ソウヤまで行事甚易く、ソウヤよりマンチウ（満州）へ渡る事も長崎より南京へ渡る程の事にはあらず、義経公渡り給んとの事ならばやすかるべき事ながら、肉食と寒気の事は日本育ちの人凌ぎ難き事にして、案外の地なるよし、松前人多月ソウヤへ至りては寒気を凌難くて、大丈夫の者も恐るるよし。ソウヤよりマンチウ及韃靼は北方にて、寒気猶強かるべし。然れば義経公の韃靼へ渡りし事は好事家の説成べし。此事いまだ詳ならず」と否定的見解を示したが、「清朝の太祖はマンチウの人にして賢君の名あり。義経公マンチウに渡り給ひし事跡マンチウの夷人言伝え、それを又ソウヤに伝ふ事にて、清の太祖は義経公の子孫に相違なしと言へり。信じ難き説ながら人の語りしを記せるのみなり。是を見る人の考へもまたあるべし」と記し、渡満説の是非は読者の判断に委ねた。
一方、同じく旅行家の菅江真澄は古松軒とほぼ同時期に蝦夷地に渡ったが、一介の旅人として4年間滞在し現在の道南エリアを訪ね歩いた。寛政4年（1792年）執筆の旅日記『蝦夷迺手布利（えぞのてぶり）』では、義経入夷説は室町時代下野国の武将・小山隆政の入夷説と混同した結果であるとして、「…判官義経の公をアヰノども、ヲキクルミとて、いまの世までもいやしかしこみ尊めり。あるいはいふ、夷（アヰノ）の、判官とて、おそれかしこみて神（カムヰ）といただきまつるは、小山悪四郎判官隆政と聞へたりし人、蝦夷の国の戦ひに鬼神のふるまひをなして、いさをしすくなからじ。小山統の家には巴の図（かた）を付てければ、巴を蝦夷（アヰノ）ら判官（オキクロ）のみしるしとて、かれにもこれにも彫て、身のたからといふいはれしかじか。（天注：小山四郎判官隆政は下野大掾義政の子たり。小山の家なる自標は双頭の巴形なり、さりければ蝦夷の国に巴をめで貴めり。是をなにくれの調度に刻て家の護りとす。蝦夷は巴をたふとむと、いやしくもおもひ、此島へ渡す具どもに何のわいためなう三頭の巴を標してわたせば、蝦夷人これを見て、をのがもてる具どもに三巴を彫てけることしかり）源九郎義経の、ゆめ此嶋へ渡給ひしよしのあらざめれど、義経の高き御名をかりにかがやかして、蝦夷人らををびやかしたる、名もなき、ひたかぶと（直甲）のものの、をこ（痴）なるふるまひにてやあらんかし。おもふに、小山判官と九郎判官と、蝦夷人が、うちまどへるにや。西の浦江差の磯辺に小山の観音て、その菩薩の堂を社に作りて、隆政のはぎばき（𦙾巻）をひめ斎るよし。うへも、悪四郎のその勲功ぞしられたる」と、菅江もまた否定的見解を残した（引用部分の現代語訳は「函館市地域史料アーカイブ：南茅部町史 上・第三編第一章第二節」を参照）。
なお、菅江と同様の見解は、すでに伊勢貞丈『安斎随筆』24巻でも「小山悪四郎蝦夷へ渡る事」と題して指摘されていた。

松浦静山
肥前国平戸藩第9代藩主・松浦静山は高い教養を身につけていたが、文政4年（1821年）から20年書き続けた『甲子夜話』正編巻88では、「義経韃靼に往しは実事なるべし」と記した。既に巻63では「予『金史』を見るに、此文なし」と金史別本を否定し、続編巻18でも「金史別録ママ」を偽書と断定し、『図書集成』にも該当する記事がないとしながら、最終的には義経の清祖説を紹介している。しかも、「愛新覚羅は今の音にて『アシハラ』なり…葦原中洲（あしはらのなかつくに）の訓に通うも何の故にや。亦其れの初めの我が国と続くことも有りてなるか」という論法を展開した。

伴信友
国学者・伴信友は、その著『中外経緯伝草稿』第2巻（天保9年・1838年）にて、『太田道灌日記』には「世に伝ふる事あやまり多し、為朝大島にて討れ、義経衣川にて討れたりといふは偽なり、為朝は高麗へ渡り…義経は蝦夷へ落し事もしるし明なり」とあることから、中国・朝鮮の18種の史書を紐解いて義経＝清祖説を独自に考証・解説した（但し、帝国大学教授・星野恒「源義経ノ話」によれば、『太田道灌日記』自体が偽書であるという）。
それによれば、元に滅ぼされた金（女真族）の領域は、明代に韃靼と称され、建州女直・海西女直及び極東最遠の野人女直の3つに大別されたが、清朝初代皇帝奴児哈赤（ヌルハチ）は、建州女直の奴児干（ヌルカン）から出て各地域を併合して満州と号した。奴児干は上記越前神保の漂流民が義経似の絵札を目撃した地である。また、『清実録』によれば、清朝の祖は、姓は愛新覚羅、名を布庫里雍順とする者が満州を開基し、その後裔・孟特穆が清朝肇祖として「原皇帝」と称されている。一方、『武備志』女直考に「建州左衛都督孟哥帖木児為七姓野人所殺」とあり、野人とは蝦夷方面を指す野人女直を意味し、従って孟哥帖木児を殺したのは蝦夷人と推定した。ここから「義経蝦夷より金国に渡りて、其王に属て功をたて、身を起し、奴児干の酋長の家を嗣で、門地を興隆したりつるが、その子孫孟特穆におよびて、建州の都督になりたるを、殊に挙て清王が肇祖といへるにもやあらむ」、さらに「さてかくおし定て考ふるに、かの孟特穆が諡を原皇帝と称へるも、義経の姓の源字をはやくより重き称とこころえをり、原字に通はして用ひたりげにきこえ、また其後孫弩爾哈斉（かれがいはゆる太祖：引用者注ヌルハチ）が世におよびて、さらに国号を建て、清と称へるも、かしこかれど、源氏の御祖の清和と申御諡号につけて、その清字を源字にもまさりて重く尊き称なる由に、おろおろ聞伝へて用ひたりしにもやあらむ」と考証した。
なお、現代の解釈では、伝説上の孟特穆と孟哥帖木児は同一人物と推定されており（孟特穆参照）、伴の考証は破綻するが、中国・朝鮮の各々の史書により所伝・系譜も異なっていることから、伴のように解釈する余地がもともと存在していた。

間宮林蔵
江戸後期の探検家・間宮林蔵は『窮髪紀譚』において、義経渡満説を載せている。

「満州人に源義経蝦夷より満州へ入りし事を度々尋ねしに聢（しか）といたせし証拠はなく候ヘども当時漢土の天子は日本人の末なりといふ事承り伝へ候……おもふに蝦夷へ行し我国人の言葉聞伝へたるにてあらん歟」

と述べている。さらに、

「唐太（樺太）を離れてマンコの川（黒竜江）を五十里ばかり上ったところのアヲレヒと云う処で、青石に日本画風で描かれ錐の様なもので彫った二疋の馬の絵を発見し、異国の筆法ではないと確信した。
間宮も描いてみたいと所望したが拙くて辞めた。右の馬の絵はもしや義経公かもしくはその従者か。
蝦夷地に弁慶崎というところがあるが、正しくは世人の誤りで蝦夷言葉（アイヌ語）にヘンケルという言葉があり、これはヘンケルサキであって弁慶崎ではない」

と述べた。林蔵が推測しているように、和人やアイヌ民族と満州の地の人々との間に密接な交流があったと言う史実を単に物語るに過ぎない。
幕府は間宮林蔵に北方探検を命じ蝦夷近辺の物産調査、北方の領土調査、ロシアの動向、貿易の可否調査が主な内容だったが、義経の子孫が蝦夷を経由し、大陸に渡ったのではないかという調査も探検の目的に含まれていた。

イザベラ・バード
英国の女性旅行家イザベラ・バードは、1878年5月から12月の7か月間、日本国内を旅行し、その記録を Unbeaten tracks in Japan , 1880（日本奥地紀行）と題する全2巻の書簡体旅行記にまとめ出版した（のち短縮版出版）。その中でバードは、アイヌの言語や風俗習慣を調査するために短期間ながら寝食を共にした北海道・平取のアイヌ集落で、彼女が怪我人や病人の世話をした礼として特別に、西洋人として初めて義経神社（The Shrine of Yoshitsune）に案内してもらった模様を伝えている（現存の神社ではなく、当時は聖地ハヨピラに祀られていた）。

「崖の突端、ジグザグ道の頂上には、日本本島の木立や高台でよく見かける木造の寺院あるいは神社が建っている。明らかに日本式建築だが、それに関してアイヌの伝承は黙して語らない。私が立った場所にはそれまでヨーロッパ人は誰ひとり立ったことはなく、身の引き締まる見聞であった。副首長が引き戸を引くと、全員が敬意を表して頭を下げた。それは白木からなる素朴な神社で、奥にある広い棚の上には、象嵌された真鍮の甲冑を身につけた歴史上の英雄義経像を収めた厨子、金属製の御幣が数枚、変色した真鍮のろうそく立て二脚、細々と描かれた中国の彩色画があった。（後略）」（短縮版 LETTER XXXVI-Continued より）

さらに脚注では、義経について以下のように解説した。

「義経は日本の歴史上最も人気のある英雄であり、少年たちの特別なお気に入りである。彼は、1192年に勝者としてミカドより征夷大将軍（夷狄を征伐する将軍）に任ぜられた頼朝の弟で、頼朝とは、ヨーロッパ的概念で日本の「世俗的皇帝」と曲解された大将軍の初代を務めた人物である。勝利者として真の名誉を称えられた義経は、兄の嫉妬と憎しみの対象となり、諸国を追われ、通説では、彼は妻子を殺した後、切腹。その首は酒漬けにされ鎌倉の兄のもとに送られた。しかし、知識人たちは彼の死に様、時期、あるいは場所について納得していない。義経は蝦夷地に逃れ、長くアイヌ民とともに暮らし、そこで12世紀末に死を迎えたと信じている者も多い。アイヌは誰よりも堅くそう信じており、彼らは義経が祖先に文字と数字をもって文明の諸技芸を教え、さらに正しい法を授けたと主張し、彼らの多くが義経を法の番人を意味する名称のもとに崇拝している。私は平取・有珠・礼文華（レブンゲ）の長老らから、後代のある日本人の侵略者が技芸を伝えた書物を持ち去ったため、以来技芸そのものが失われ、アイヌは現在の状態に陥ったと聞かされた。なぜアイヌはナイフや槍だけでなく鉄や粘土で器を作らないのかと尋ねると、『日本人が書物を奪ったのだ』という決まり文句が返ってくる。」（短縮版 脚注  より）

鳥居龍蔵
人類学者・鳥居龍蔵は事あるごとに義経＝ジンギスカン説を否定している。明治38年（1905年）2月1日付読売新聞は「亜爾泰（アルタイ）山頭の神鏡」と題して、バイカル湖辺アルクスク約50里のアラールス・スカヤステープの一小村にあるラマ廟が安置している神鏡には、高砂の尾上松、爺と姥、鶴亀の紋、「正三位藤原秀衡朝臣謹製」の文字があり、これが源義経を想起し、義経＝成吉思汗説も事実無根ではないのではないか、という記事を掲載。これに対し、鳥居は2月4日付同新聞で、鏡に『正三位藤原秀衡朝臣謹製』と記すのは江戸時代に盛んに行われ、それがアイヌを仲介者とする北方交易によって大陸に入り、それがたまたまその地に収まったに過ぎないと論説した。

金田一京助
言語学者・金田一京助はジンギスカン説はもちろん入夷説に否定の立場で、御曹子島渡の説話が蝦夷地に渡り、アイヌの口にも「判官様」が知られているのを後世の人々が知って広まらせたということを聞き出し、アイヌは義経を口承文芸にしていないと述べている（『旅と伝説』所収、1930年）。また、オキクルミはアイヌの創造神であり、アイヌにとっては迷惑な話だったが、判官＝オキクルミという話をすると、内地の人が喜ぶのでそう話すことがあったとアイヌから本音を聞きだした（『アイヌ文学』1933年）。金田一は明治期に偽本である金史別本の作者を沢田源内と断定した。なお、小谷部全一郎は『成吉思汗ハ源義経也・著述の動機と再論』で、金田一と応酬している。「史論としては、まず結論から入っていて、自分だけの都合のいい情報だけを抜き出して採用し、都合のよくないものは初めから棄てている。『史論』は吟味を加え客観性をもって調べなければいけない。『伝説』は人々がそのまま事実と信じるから伝わるのであって、それが正しいかどうかは分からない。この説は小谷部氏の『義経信仰』ですよ」と金田一は答えたが、小谷部に「売名行為であり、学徒としても薄弱だ」とやりかえされている。
同じ否定論者でも金田一は多少異なり、他の学者が文献を元に史実と合わせ、論説を行うというスタイルに対し、金田一は文献ではなく事象からの推論を固める方式で、その結果として義経生存説を否定するというスタイルをとった。

義経入夷譚が江戸時代初期の寛文年間に集中していること
『御伽草子』の「御曹子島渡」や義経語りが、蝦夷地での義経伝説として波及したこと
所謂『判官びいき』が義経生存説の勃興に大きく影響したこと
など、義経生存説否定の研究上、金田一の影響は少なくなかった。しかし、金史別本を沢田源内の偽作と決めつけたり、年代を間違えたりしている事などから、語学者としては実績があるものの、史家としての信頼性は高くない。

シーボルトの説
文政6年（1823年）に初来日し、5年後にシーボルト事件を引き起こしたことで知られるオランダ商館医のドイツ人医学者シーボルトは、独自の日本研究に基づいて義経＝ジンギスカン説を展開した。
その契機となったのは、新井白石の『蝦夷志』及び『読史余論』で、長崎出島の商館長イサーク・ティチングによって翻訳され、コンラッド・マルテ・ブルンが『地理および歴史に関する探検旅行記録集』に掲載したものを読んだという。白石が『蝦夷志』で義経が韃靼に渡ったと記しているとことと、友人であるオランダ語通詞・吉雄忠次郎からの義経はさらに元の祖となったという話を基に、1852年刊行の『NIPPON（日本）』第1編・第5章の注記10として、以下のように記した。

「義経の蝦夷への脱出、さらに引き続いて対岸のアジア大陸への脱出の年は、蒙古人の歴史では蒙古遊牧民族の帝国創建という重要な時期にあたっている。
『東蒙古史』には豪族の息子鉄木真が28歳の年ケルレン川の草原においてアルラト氏によって可汗として承認された。
…その後間もなくチンギス・ハンははじめオノン川のほとりに立てられた九つの房飾りのついた白旗を掲げた。
…そしてベーデ族四十万の支配者となった。」

論点は以下の通り。

チンギス・ハンが28歳で大汗に即位した年と、義経が31歳で自殺した年は等しく1189年であった
チンギス・ハンが即位の礼の際に九つの纓（えい）のついた白旗を立てたが、同じく源氏も白旗を用いる
チンギス・ハンの「汗」は日本語の「守」と同じ語源であり、チンギス・ハン以前にアジアでは用例がない
白色を尊重するなど大汗の宮廷の風俗・習慣・言語等が天皇のそれと類似している
これだけでは断定に至らず、あくまでも注記として扱っているに過ぎない。
シーボルトは、様々な伝承、説話、先駆者達の研究を綿密に検討した結果、義経が蝦夷から大陸へ渡った説を支持する。義経は源氏の一員として白い旗を揚げたはずである。「ハン [Khan]」という称号は、義経が貴族出身者として持っていた日本語の「カミ（守）」から導き出せる。義経は1189年に死んだとされるが、その後蝦夷から大陸へ渡れば1190年代にモンゴルに到着したことになる。一方、チンギス・ハンは生年月日不詳で、前半生の史料が少なく、1190年代に突如としてモンゴル中央平原に出現したことから、可能性があるとした。またチンギス・ハンは九つの房をつけた白い軍旗を使用し、モンゴルや中国になかった長弓を得意としたが、これらは義経がモンゴルに持ち込んだものと考えた（なお、カーン〈ハン、ハーン〉については、『元朝秘史』に他部族の長を合罕と称するという記述があり、日本との関わりについての指摘はない）。

モンゴルの宮廷習慣と日本貴族との共通点
他にもモンゴルの宮廷習慣と日本の貴族たちの習慣に共通点が多く、例えば城壁の外装は「幕 MAKU」といい、紋章を用い、朝廷や祝宴では白色が用いられること、白い天幕に「シラ」という名称をつけること、さらにはその頃に日本独特の長い弓と矢も用いれられるようになったこと、中国で一般的に用いれられていた短い弓や矢とは明らかに違っていたこと、中国人に非常に恐れられ、「長い弓の盗賊」と呼ばれるようになったこと、などを挙げながら実証主義の姿勢で同説を構築していった（原田信男は殆ど言葉遊びに近く、単なる推測の域を脱していないと否定的に評価）。

『蒙古源流』からの引用
上記引用文中の『東蒙古史』は、イサーク・ヤコブ・シュミットがサガン・セチェンによるモンゴル年代記『蒙古源流』（1662年）を独語訳したものである。一説には1189年にはチンギス・ハンは34歳であったといい、1206年には44歳で北アジアを統一し、強いハンと云う意味で、可汗を称したともいう。また「九つの房のついた白い旗」の存在は実態はよく判っておらず、一本の旗に九つの吹流しが付いていたものと考えられており、かつては古代中国で絶大な権力を持った王の象徴とされていたという。
なお、ケルレン川はバイカル湖周辺のダツルン山脈（ヘンティー山脈か）南部を流れており、アムール川にそそぐ川である。またアルラト族はチンギス・ハンを支えた名門で直属の部下に多くなっている。ベーテについては不明だが、族長と巫女のベゲが統治していたことからこのベゲの部族だと推測される。なお、シーボルトはチンギス・ハンの前に系図はなく、チンギス・ハンのあとに系図はあるとしたが、チンギス・ハンについては系譜がはっきりしている。

再来日時に正史として認めるよう懇願
シーボルトは「チンギス・ハンの伝説的な系譜を重要視しているわけではなく、憶測を逞しくしようとは思わず、義経が蒙古の戦場に登場することに推測を加えることで、歴史家の注目を集めたいのである」と結んでいる。
追放処分から30年後（1861年）再び来日し、幕府顧問となったが、蕃書調所に勤めた西周に再三に渡って義経＝ジンギスカン説を正史として認めるよう薦めている。蕃書調所教授手伝の大島総左衛門高任が手塚律蔵好盛とオランダの尺度エル（el）とフート（voet）のことで議論していたが、判らないのでシーボルトに質問すると、

フートは日本の尺と変わらず、元の太祖以下二世三世がヨーロッパに侵攻したとき、日本の尺度を彼らに伝えたからである。蒙古人がなぜ日本の尺度を用いたかと云えば、その太祖が日本人だったからに外ならず、彼の名は〇〇〇というが、圓牆を避けて蝦夷地に逃げたが、土人を征服したため益々兄の怒りを買い、討伐の風評に恐れをなして満州に渡った。ついで蒙古に入って一地を攻略し次第に近隣諸国を併合してついに國を元とした。自分が去年支那に渡航したとき、元の太祖の建立に関わる健靖寧寺記と題する碑文を示されたことがあるが、大意が上に述べた事であり、碑の側面には鳥居が刻んであった。因に明治にこの碑文が問題にされたとき、健セリュウ（青竜）寺記と聞き間違われ、義経の墓ともされてしまった。

大島は碑文を写し、西周もシーボルトから太祖は義経、妖僧は弁慶と聞かされたが、信じなかった。蒙古字の碑文も示されたが、漢字、ラマ教の名があったと記されている。

吉雄忠次郎
『日本』でシーボルトは、吉雄忠次郎が確固たる発言をしているという内容で、

「義経自殺の噂は、頼朝を安心させ、また反対派の武装を解除するため広められ、国の年代記に記入されたとし、更に彼は義経は蝦夷から韃靼に渡り、元朝の祖となったと確言している」

と記している。シーボルトが彼の影響を受けている事が窺え、吉雄もまたこの説を信じていたことが判る。

小シーボルト
ハインリッヒ・フォン・シーボルト（Heinrich Freiherrn von Siebold：小シーボルト）は、父シーボルトの次男である。北海道の平取などで義経が築いていたというチャシ（砦）などを調査、同時期に同地を訪れたイザベラ・バードとも親交を持ち、情報交換している。よく知られている父親と比べ知名度はないが、膨大な日本コレクションを蒐集したことから、小シーボルトと呼ばれている。1881年、Ethnologische Studien über die Aino auf der Insel Yesso に捕論2編を付して公刊、義経＝ジンギスカン説を肯定的に紹介した（邦訳『小シーボルト蝦夷見聞記』）。

シーボルト説の波紋
グリフィス
1876年、明治初期のお雇い外国人グリフィスは、明治維新までの日本史を網羅したThe Mikado's Empire （皇国） をニューヨークで出版。源義経の死に関する一節の脚注で、中国の『Seppu』なる書に、Genghis Khanは日本から来た源義経であると書かれているとした。

義経の死に関して確かな真実は、まったく定まっていない。一説には、彼は死地を脱して蝦夷へ逃亡し、長くアイヌとともに暮らし、そこで自然に死を迎えたか、あるいは hara-kiri 切腹したとされる。アイヌは彼の行為に大きな畏敬の念をもって今日までその精神を崇拝し、日高にある墓所に神社を建立した。あるいは、義経はアジア大陸に逃亡し、偉大な征服者Genghis Khanになったと主張するものもいる。*　この最後の意見について、かつてある日本人学生は「日本人の途方もない虚栄心なくして、このような report 伝承は生み出せない」と述べた。

*　中国で刊行された伝説及び雑史を集めた『Seppu』という書物では、Genghis Khanは日本から来た義経であったと述べられている。Minamoto Yoshitsune は中国語では Gen Gikeママである。彼はその有名な死後、Temujin（or Tenjin）とも呼ばれた。周知の通り、モンゴルの征服者が最初に登場したときの名はTemujinだった。日本のアイヌは義経を判官大明神（偉大なる立法者）という称号で神格化した。義経は1159年に生まれた。有名な死を迎えた時は30歳だった［満年齢：引用者注］。Genghis Khanは、一般に認められているデータによると、1160年に生まれ、1227年に没した。Gen GikeとGenghis Khanが同一人物であるなら、英雄は38年間の功績を残した。Genghis Khanは血まみれの手で生まれたとされている。シャーマン（霊感を受けた予見者）の言葉に従い、彼はGenghis（greatest 史上最高）という名を用い、自らの民をMongols（bold 果敢）と呼んだ。地上全体の征服が彼に約束された。彼とその息子は、中国と朝鮮を征服し、バグダッドのカリフ制を打倒し、モンゴル帝国をオーデル川とドナウ川まで広げた。

以上のように、チンギス・ハンは英語で「Genghis Khan」と表記され、源義経＝Gen Gike＝Genghis、天神＝Tenjin＝Temjinの音韻の類似性から同一人物の可能性が示唆された。また、日本人学生の発言からは、明治初期にはこの説が広く浸透していたことが窺われる。

手塚律蔵
手塚律蔵は蕃書調所に勤務し、シーボルトが見たという「建靖寧寺記」の件を記した『柳庵雑記』の筆者に比定される人物で、維新後は瀬脇寿人（ひさと）と改名した。瀬脇は明治9年（1876年）から同11年まで、ウラジオストク（浦潮）港の貿易事務官を務めながら義経の事跡を探索、その検証結果を『浦潮港日記』に綴ったが、その考察は義経＝清祖説を論じた伴信友『中外経緯伝』に依りながら進められた。同港から170㎞ほど離れた東の蘇城（スーチャン、現パルチザンスク）を訪れたところ、付近には日本人墳墓や古跡が多く、寛永年間に日本人の武将が来てこの地方を支配したという伝承を聞き出し、さらに蘇城近くには「ハンガン崎」という地名があることを聞き、ここは韃靼でもあるから、日本の武将とは判官＝義経を指し、やがて蒙古を席巻し、元の世を起こしたという論理を展開した。しかし、満州の満を源満仲から採り、源氏の源から元と称したとするなど、状況証拠の羅列に終始するものであった。

末松謙澄
末松謙澄は伊藤博文の知遇を得て、明治11年（1878年）から外交官として英国・ロンドンに赴任、依願免官後の明治14年（1881年）秋からケンブリッジ大学で学んだ。その間、末松は江戸時代からの義経生脱説の流れを下敷きに、手塚律蔵（瀬脇寿人）の『浦潮港日記』やグリフィスの記述などを参考に、The identity of the great conqueror Genghis Khan with the Japanese hero Yoshitsuné （大征服者成吉思汗は日本の英雄源義経と同一人物なること）と題する論文にまとめ1879年に出版。『大日本史』などの記述を引用したほか、独自の見地からも論証した。執筆の背景には英国人らから日本が清国の属国のように見なされ、日本人は世界的な英雄を出した民族であり、卑下されるのは心外として大胆な仮説を唱えたとされている。
この論文は翌年横浜の英字新聞『Japan Weekly Mail』で分割連載され、さらに内田弥八訳述『義経再興記』（明治史学会雑誌）として明治18年（1885年）に和訳出版されベストセラーとなり（初版は明治18年3月、20年には7版）、小谷部全一郎による立論の原点となった。

重野安繹・星野恒・永田方正による批判
『義経再興記』出版後の明治23年（1890年）、文学博士で帝国大学文科大学教授・重野安繹は、家塾での「源義経が蝦夷を経て金朝の時其の土に王たりし事、又元の鉄木真と同人なりと云ふ説の無稽なることを述ぶ」という講義で、義経再興記は江戸期の妄説に基づく小シーボルト（原文で重野はシーボルトの長男次男を混同）の説を、さらに末松が英文で書いたものを翻訳したものに過ぎず、大英傑の鉄木真と比べ、義経は「小心翼々たる人」と評した。ただし、義経生脱説の全否定はせず、可能性として「義経は実に衣川辺又僅に蝦夷に入りしに過ぎざるべしと余は考ふる」とした。
翌1891年、同大学教授・星野恒は、講演録「義経ノ話」を『東洋学芸雑誌』に発表し、源義経の衣川自刃について13の論点を示しながら、史実として再確認した。また、義経は死後、最初に大河兼任が反乱時にその名を号し、江戸時代に蝦夷へ渡り、元禄享保期に金国へ、寛政期に清国の先祖に、後年伴信友がそれを再説、明治維新後再びそれが喧伝され、最後に成吉思汗説と、計7回再生したとする。
さらに明治26年（1893年）、永田方正（アイヌ研究・教育者）は、「義経蝦韃考」（『史海』第27号・明治26年9月号）において、アイヌの言語と地誌の分析、江戸時代の偽書の考察、成吉思汗の親族を含めた経歴、中国大陸の歴史等を詳細に参照しながら、同一人物説はもちろん大日本史や新井白石の入夷説も完全否定した。
また、星野らが編纂に携わった明治36年（1903年）刊行の東京帝国大学史料編纂所『大日本史料』第四編之二では、「文治五年閏四月三十日」条に、「○義経ノ、衣川館ニ自殺セシコトハ、前掲ノ諸書ニ徴シテ明カナリ、後世、或ハ其遁レテ、蝦夷ニ至リシヲ云フ者アリ、遂ニ支那ニ赴キテ、金国ニ事ヘシトシ、又、清国ノ肇祖トナリシトスルノ説ヲ生ズルニ至レリ、然リト錐ドモ、其信ヲ取ルニ足ラザルハ、前人既ニ弁明シテ、復、余薀ナシ、今、一切之ヲ採ラズ」と改めて注記された。

小谷部全一郎の説
小谷部全一郎は、自伝によれば少年期に『義経再興記』を読んで以来、アイヌ問題に興味を持ち続けたとされる。アメリカ留学中に受洗し、牧師にもなったが、帰国後まもなく聖職を辞し、家族で北海道に移住してアイヌ子弟を救済・教育する事業に取り組んだ。アイヌの人々が信仰するオキクルミが源義経ではないかという話から、改めて義経伝説に関心をもち、その後シベリア出兵時に陸軍通訳官として赴任、「成吉思汗＝義経」の痕跡を調べるべく満蒙を精力的に調査し、1920年帰国。この独自調査・解釈に基づき、義経が平泉で自害せず、北海道、樺太にわたり、さらにモンゴルに渡って成吉思汗となったことを確信し、大正13年（1924年）に『成吉思汗ハ源義經也』を出版した。

小谷部の論拠
奥州衣川で文治5年閏4月30日に討ち取られた義経の首は、事件を5月22日に報告し、6月13日に鎌倉の頼朝に届けられている。いくら中世とは言え、当時は早馬を飛ばせば平泉から鎌倉までは数日で使者は着くはずである。何故1か月以上もかかったのか。故意に腐らせ偽物と判別できなくするためではないか。
成吉思汗の少年時代の記録として「朽木の洞に隠れていて助かった」とあるが、兄頼朝の伝説と内容が重なる。
『大日本史』などでは鎌倉に届けられた首は偽首としており、蝦夷へ逃亡したと記している。
延宝年間の『可足記』に九郎判官の身代わりに杉目太郎行信が致し、行信の首が鎌倉に運ばれた、と記す。
北海道と大陸の間に昔からアイヌの行き来があって、義経一行はしばらく北海道に滞在した後アイヌの水先案内人によって大陸に渡った可能性が十分に考えられるのではないか。
成吉思汗が1206年にハーンに即位した時の「九旒の白旗」の建立は源氏の氏の長者、武家の棟梁の宣言ではないか。「白旗」は源氏の旗印であり、「九旒」は九郎判官を意味するものではないか。
成吉思汗は笹竜胆の紋を使用した（推定）。笹竜胆（源氏の家紋）を尊び、九の数を好むのは己の名の九郎に因んだからではないか。
成吉思汗はニロン族、すなわち日の国よりきた人として蒙古に伝えられている。この「ニロン」とは「ニホン（日本）」のことはないか。
成吉思汗は別名を「クロー」と称した。これは「九郎判官」ではないか。また、軍職の名は「タイショー」として現代に伝わる。蒙古の古城跡では「城主はクロー」と称していたという言い伝えがある。
沿海州ナホトカとウラジオストクの間に「ハンガン」という岬と泊地があり、九郎判官が上陸した土地ではないか。
成吉思汗が滞在した熱河省（現河北省北東部）に「へいせん」という地名があるのは、義経ゆかりの「平泉」によるのではないか。
蒙古では現在でも「オボー祭り」が8月15日に開かれているが、義経が幼年時代をすごした京都鞍馬山でも、この日、同じような祭りが見られる。
成吉思汗はニルン族の貴族キャト氏族だが、「キャト」は「キョウト」「京都」出身をあらわしているのではないか。
国名「元」は「源」に通じる
年齢もほぼ同じ。義経が衣川で討たれたのが30歳で、その数年後ジンギスカンが表舞台に登場するようになった時期の年齢が30代半ばであるなら、辻褄が合うのではないか。
チンギス・ハンの前半生には空白部分が多い。
両者とも背は高くなかった。酒も全然飲めなかった。
戦術も同じ、戦い方もそっくりであった。
蒙古の地名や現地言語に日本内地、蝦夷との類似性がみられる（チタ、スルガなど）。蒙古には「源」の苗字が多い。
ラマ教の寺院に伝わるチンギス・ハンの肖像はどこか日本人的な顔立ちをしている。

蘇城（スーチャン）
小谷部はまた、ロシアのウラジオストックから120キロメートルほどのところに、蘇城（スーチャン）という古城の遺跡があり、日本の武将が築いたという伝説が残っていることを記している。その武将は後に中国本土へ攻め入って、大王になったという。昔、日本の武将が危難を避けて本国を逃れ、この地に城を築いた。武将がここで「蘇生した」という逸話から、「蘇城」と命名された。武将はこののち城を娘に任せ、自らは中国本土に攻め入って強大な王国を建てたという。ハンガン岬から東北に120キロメートル離れたところにあるこの「スウチャン」は中国語であり、沿海州は1858年のネルチンスク条約でロシア領になるまでは清国の支配下にあったため、ロシア領下でも中国語の地名が残っているという地元の伝承を紹介している。

義経の古碑
小谷部によれば、ニコラエフスクから100キロメートルの郊外に石碑があって、そこに現在は撤去されているが「義経」などの漢字と、明瞭な笹竜胆の紋所が刻まれてあったといい、「双城子（ニコラエフスク）の市邑に、土俗のいわゆる義将軍の古碑と称するものあり、土人はこれを日本の武将の碑とも或は支那の将軍の碑とも傳ふ。居留日本人は一般にこれを義経の碑と称し、而して其の建てられたる市の公園を、我が居留民は現に之を義経公園と呼びて有名なるものなり」とした。

笹竜胆の紋
大正14年（1925年）2月1日付の朝日新聞で、シベリア出兵当時、ニコラエフスクの近くでタタール人の芝居を見たところ、その巻狩の場面で役者が笹竜胆の紋をつけた日本流の鎧兜で登場したことを記している。理由を尋ねたところ、昔から伝わっているもので、誰が作ったかについては分からないという返事だったという。この笹竜胆の紋は、沿海州のナホトカの一般住居にもつけられており、これも義経ゆかりのものではないかと小谷部は説明し、清和源氏の家紋である笹竜胆をジンギスカン軍が紋章として使用したと主張した。

結論
笹竜胆の紋のみならず、それまで日本にしかなかった長弓の使用、白旗の使用など、それまで蒙古の慣習になかったものが成吉思汗によりはじまり、それらは源義経の文物と一致しており、これこそ、成吉思汗が源義経にほかならない何よりの証拠であると、小谷部は結論づけた。

小谷部説に対する反応・反論
大正13年（1924年）の小谷部の著書『成吉思汗ハ源義經也』は、判官びいきの民衆の心をつかみ大ベストセラーとなった（昭和初期を通じて重版・増補版出版）。同書が歴史家には相手にされない一方、広く民衆に受け入れられた背景として、単に判官びいきの心情だけではなく、日本の英雄が大陸に渡って世界を征服したという物語が、日本が日清戦争、日露戦争を経て「満蒙こそ日本の生命線」と考える人びとの心をとらえ、シベリア出兵をおこなっていた時期の風潮に適合したことが指摘されている。
これに対し、翌大正14年（1925年）、雑誌『中央史壇』（第10巻第2号、国史講習会）は、「成吉思汗は源義経にあらず」と題する臨時増刊号を組み、国史学、東洋史学、考古学、民俗学、国文学、国語学・言語学など当時第一級の研究者らが大々的に反論を行った。
特に言語学の金田一京助、漢学者で歴史学者の中島利一郎らの批判は激しく、金田一京助は「小谷部説は主観的であり、歴史論文は客観的に論述されるべきものであるとし、この種の論文は「信仰」である」と全面否定した。また中島利一郎は、小谷部の論点を個別に考証して反論、最後には、「粗忽屋」「珍説」「滑稽」「児戯に等しい」という言葉を用いて痛罵した。

笹竜胆の紋について
『中央史壇』の沼田頼輔によると、源平時代はまだ紋章が確立しておらず、また紋章は朝廷から賜る物ではないとしている。従来清和源氏は笹竜胆を、桓武平氏は蝶を、藤原氏は藤を、橘氏は橘を家紋として与えたと伝わっているが、正史実録にはないことで、源平時代にはまだ源平両氏の間には紋章は用いられることは無く赤と白の色彩の軍旗で源平を区別した。ただし、その部下には熊谷直実、兒玉黨の如く、既に家紋を用いた者が無かったわけではない。吾妻鏡の文治5年の仕様書によれば、白の錬絹でこれを作り、上に『天照大神八幡大菩薩』の神號をあげ、下に鳩二羽を縫い付けたのみであって、他には何も書かれなかった。準備として下総の千葉常胤に命じて軍旗を調製した。また、公家の村上源氏、宇多源氏が笹竜胆を用いたからとて、武家の清和源氏が用いるわけはないとする。
なお、笹竜胆の紋は義経の属する清和源氏ではなく村上源氏のものとする意見があるが、河内国石川郡発祥の石川氏は、源義家（清和源氏）の子・源義時を祖とし、代々石川郡を本拠とした石川氏の家紋が、「石川竜胆」という紋である（羽継原合戦記）。笹竜胆は、村上源氏（六条・久世（くぜ）・岩倉・千種（ちぐさ）・梅渓（うめたに））以外に宇多源氏（綾小路）も使用している。

史学からの反論
臨風生こと笹川臨風（歴史家・評論家）による『中央史檀』での反論は以下の通り。也速該巴阿禿児（エスガイバアトル）、其妻訶額侖兀真（ホエルンワデン）との間には4人の男子と1人の女児とがあり、成吉思汗はその長子であったが、也速該は塔塔児（タタール）の酋長帖木真（テムジン）を破り捕虜にし、後に成吉思汗となる子が斡難の送理（オンノのセリ）温弧山に偶然生まれたので敵将の名をとって帖木真と名付けた。其の産まるる時、右の手に髀石の如き血塊を握って、呱々の聲を挙げたと云うことである。『元朝秘史』、『元史訳文証補』、『聖武親征録』、『蒙古源流』、『元史太祖本記』、『長春真人の西遊記』、ドウソンの『蒙古史』に至るまで成吉思汗の誕生及び其の人物が詳細に記されており、源義経再興伝説などを要れる余地はない。博引傍証百千なるも、あやふやでは何の権威も有しない。青い眼鏡で得意勝手な我田引水の筆法を用いられたら、流石の成吉思汗も地下に苦笑を禁じえぬ。判官びいきは現在まで廃らない一種の人情美であるが、義経と成吉思汗には大分その人物に相違があり、例えば義経は兵法に長じ、戦略に巧みであったが、成吉思汗ほどの蓋世的英雄ではなかった。若し成吉思汗であるほどの大豪傑であったなら、大物浦から引還し、当麻越えで吉野に入り、山伏姿の妻に様々憂目つらい目を凌いで奥に入り、遂に頼朝と覇を争い得なかったような不器用さ加減はなかったであろう、と書いている。

中島利一郎の反論
「『義経再興論』の明治18年から40年余りを経て、大正13年の末にこのような馬鹿な書が出版されるとは思ってもみなかった」と前置きし、「小谷部氏が名もない一酋長の遺跡の前に立って、その辺の都祉と思っていたなどとはとても他に見られない図である。『余之を訊き、愕然として驚き、而して』その後ろにつぐべき言葉を知らぬ」と結び、義経＝オキクルミ、義経＝ジンギスカンではないと断言した。
「大汗のクロー宮古にありという、氏の独合黒点に止まる。実に粗忽屋である」とまで書いて痛罵した。
「人間生活のやみがたき本能を洞察し、その理解に到達する方法」（岩崎前掲書）をもって小谷部説を批判し、「最後は笑って義経論を閉じることが出来た」と書いている。

（要人が「クロー」と満州で呼ばれていたことに対し）小谷部は九郎（義経官職の九郎判官）に結び付けたがっているが、蒙古語「古兒罕グルハン」であり、「部落の長」である。発音は「グラン」に近い。
「黒森山判官稲荷神社縁起」はまったくの偽書である。
日高沙流郡ハヨピラなるハイエヌサウシの地は義経の遺跡ではない。住吉のアイヌがHayo（剣魚の鼻の武器）を「崖の間」で発見し、それをオキクルミの器だと信じてその地を霊場視し木弊を奉った処である。
オキクルミは造化神の意味でアイヌ語の「クルミ」は日本男子で、「クルマツ」は日本婦人のことだから、混乱して蝦夷に渡ってきた和人の英雄と解する人が多くなった。永田方正に従えばオキクルミはオオキリマイ、オキキリマイと云っていたのが訛ったのである。
アイヌ説話のサマウンクルはオキクルミに先んじて死んでいるし、オキクルミは樺太アイヌから殺されている。サマウンクルが弁慶であるとすれば、義経に先んじて死んだことになるから小谷部氏の大陸渡航説はありえない。
源九郎義経判官のシンボルとして「九」の数を挙げているがアイヌは「六」がシンボル数である。
小谷部は「西比利亜及沿海州の蘇城」、「双城子と義将軍の石碑」の二項を設け、日本の武将金烏諸（キンウチョ）の名が成吉思汗の訛りだとするが、山丹人は黒龍江岸ばかりでなく、樺太南部にも住んでいるから、アイヌから云えば樺太・山丹は選ぶところではない。従って蘇城などに行くわけがない。
「バル」とは蒙古語の虎の意味。蒙古語の虎はバルでなく「巴兒思」である。城は「巴剌合孫」（バラスガン）。
法衣（ホロム）は蒙古語で、他に満州語、朝鮮語、でも似た言葉があり「クルメー」、「コロモ」などアルタイ語族の通用詞である。
タイシャー（小谷部説は大将の意）は蒙古語では大石（タイシー）。親友の意味の蒙古語アンダ（安答）はオロッコ語のAndaなどと同系である。
小谷部が山の上を「タッパ」と聞いたのは、蒙古語の「峠、峰」の意味である「蓉巴」（ダベ）を訊き間違えたのだ。
成吉思汗の父の名は「エゾカイ」ではなく「也速該」（エガイ）である。蝦夷は他民族はエゾと呼ばない。アイヌ語や奇鄰語では、Ainuといい、山丹語ではKuiである。蝦夷（カイ）に近い。ニクブン語（ギリヤーク語）ではKugiである。
ニロンはニホンの訛りではなく、蒙古語の「納㘓（口偏に闌）ナラン」、納藍（日、太陽）から訛ったものである。
キャトはアボルガジイ（アブル・ガーズィー）氏曰く成吉思汗の姓は「キャン」で、蒙古語の岩石に直下する飛泉の意味で、「キャト」はその複数形である。

中島利一郎の反論その2
小谷部の反論
『中央史壇』の反論に対し、同年中に小谷部は『成吉思汗ハ源義経也・著述の動機と再論』を出版、史学側と応酬している。旧知の金田一の批判に対しては、「売名行為であり、学徒としても薄弱だ」とやりかえしている。中島利一郎に対しても、「神経病的」、「鎖国時代の田舎侍が西洋人の肉を食わんとするが如き態度」と猛烈に批判し、最後には「痴漢」とも記した。
小谷部全一郎『成吉思汗ハ源義經也』は、満州国建国とそれにともなう移民の増加などによって脚光を浴び、戦中から戦後にかけてさかんに増刷され、「成吉思汗＝源義経」説をとなえた類似の書籍は戦後もいくどか出版されてきた。しかし同書を越えるようなものはなく、歴史学説としては相手にされていない。また、小谷部説は末松謙澄説を踏襲しているが、間宮林蔵の書なども参考にされている。

『偽史冒険世界』での小谷部評
長山靖生は『偽史冒険世界』で『成吉思汗ハ源義經也』の小谷部全一郎説を論評し、荒唐無稽な法螺話に過ぎない話がベストセラーになってしまったとして、余りにも売れすぎたため『中央史檀』で史家と称する者たちが反論した事に対し驚いている。
特に長山は蒙古王室並びに清朝はチンギス・ハンの子孫であり、源氏の末裔であるという内容について、政治的戦略として大陸侵攻に利用されたとし、「過去の歴史に奇妙な空想を差し入れて史実をかき乱した奇書に留まらず、日本がアジア大陸をかき乱していく未来を予測し、戦乱への賛美を掲げた極めて政治的な書物だった」と、批判している。歴史学者の高桑駒吉が『中央史檀』の中で「満州、蒙古にある種の軍部の陰謀があり、書籍を多数買い上げて各方面へ配布した」と書いていて、満蒙進出に小谷部の本が利用されたのは事実のようである。

戦後の動向
中尊寺金色堂の学術調査
昭和25年（1950年）、朝日新聞社の資金援助により奥州藤原氏の廟所である中尊寺金色堂の学術調査（藤原4代の遺体と副葬品）が行われた。従来、藤原忠衡のものと信じられていた遺体は兄の藤原泰衡の首であり、当時の作法によってできた傷跡であろうということがわかった。従来は、泰衡は父藤原秀衡の遺命にそむいて義経を殺害し、火内（秋田県大館市周辺）の贄柵で河田次郎に殺害されたのだから、秀衡の横に安置されるはずはないと考えられていた。調査内容は3遺体が日本人かアイヌか、どんな状況で死亡したのか、藤原忠衡の首なのか、河田次郎に殺された後継者の藤原泰衡のものではないか、ということが議論され、記者会見のなかで長谷部言人博士と鈴木尚博士は「四氏遺体のミイラ化は人工的に手を加えられた結果ではなく、忠衡の首と称せられるものは泰衡の物と判明した。藤原清衡始め四代の当主にはアイヌらしい面影はない」という見解を発表した。

高木彬光『成吉思汗の秘密』
昭和33年（1958年）、推理作家高木彬光が推理小説『成吉思汗の秘密』を著した。奥州藤原氏三代の富貴栄華の源泉は北海道を越えて、樺太、シベリアの黄金入手にあり、これにより中尊寺の黄金の仏像などを建立したと、大胆な推理を神津恭介が展開している。義経は北へ逃亡するというよりも軍資金のための黄金をシベリアまで探しにいったと作家の高木は推理し、主人公の神津恭介に言わせている。当時は温暖であり、渡党などと和人が交易をしており、大陸との接点もあったと推定されるので有り得ない説ではない。
義経をチンギス・ハンとする論理の弱さ例：『成吉思汗』の「汗」を「水と干」に分けると、
「成 レ吉 思 レ水干」となり、遠くモンゴルの地で良きこと「吉」を成し遂げ、
「吉成りて、水干を思う」

となる。水干とは衣装をまとった白拍子の静御前を指して偲んでいるという説。（ただし、「汗」はハーンの音訳であり、3世紀頃から用いられてきた用法である）など矛盾点が歴史作家海音寺潮五郎に批判された。これに対し、高木は表立った反論は行わず、作品を改訂した際に神津恭介が「ある歴史小説家」への回答を行うくだりを追加している。また、「成吉思汗は身体が大きかったのに、義経は身体が小さかったではないか」と云う指摘が記録されているが、これに対しては、「弁慶がなりすまし、義経は裏で采配を振るったのではないか」という推測を繰り広げている。なお、最近の研究ではモンゴル日本大使館の肖像画に体の小さなチンギス・カンが確認されており、この点は矛盾が無くなっている。

丘英夫の指摘
歴史作家・丘英夫は、モンゴル人であるはずのチンギス・ハンには様々な謎が多すぎるとし、杉山正明『大モンゴルの世界』も参照した『元史』太祖本紀から、チンギス・ハンの崩御は1227年（66歳）であり、テムジンと呼ばれていた時期にモンゴル高原に姿を現したのは、1202年か1203年（41、42歳）で、それ以前の前半生は歴史家にとって「闇」であると書いている。

異民族疑惑
『元史』には1202年にテムジンがケレイト部族の長ワンカンと共にナイマン部を攻めた日に、ジャムカがワンカンに「私はあなたにとって白翎雀であるが、彼は鴻雁である。白翎雀は、寒暑に関わらず北方にいるが、鴻雁は寒くなると南へ飛んで行き暖を取る」と語ったとあり、ジャムカはテムジンを渡り鳥の鴻雁に例えて、暗にモンゴル部族とは別の異民族の人間だと書いているのではないかと指摘した。

上海人民出版社『成吉思汗伝』に、1204年初夏、テムジンによるナイマン侵攻時、ジャムカはナイマン側についていたが、「ナイマンの王タヤンカンはジャムカに尋ねた。『その後ろから飢えた鷹のように真っ先にやってくるのは誰か』。ジャムカは『彼は私のアンダ（盟友）であるテムジンである。彼は、全身に鉄の鎧を着て飢えた鷹のようにやってくる』」と語ったとされ、「全身に」とは鎧だけでなく兜も着用していたことを意味するとし、モンゴル高原で鉄の甲冑をどこで入手したのだろうかと疑問視している。

かな文字と五十音図
1204年、モンゴルがナイマンを攻略、ウイグル人のタタトンガを捕虜にしたが、『元史』タタトンガ伝によれば、テムジンは掌印官の彼がウイグル文字に精通しているのを知り、モンゴル文字を作らせたという。33文字から成るモンゴル文字は、大部分がウイグル文字であるが、その中で4文字は日本語のかな文字が用いられ、モンゴル文字の字順はウイグル文字の字順とは違う五十音体系（ア、カ、サ、タ、マ、ヤ、ラ、ワ）になっているとしている。4文字のかな文字と五十音体系を彼がモンゴル人だとすれば、どこで習得したのかと丘は疑問を呈している。

漢文の備忘録
また、『長春真人西遊記』によれば、1222年の西征中にチンギス・ハンは道教の師長春真人を山東省萊州から呼び寄せてハバルク郊外で不老長寿の道を尋ね、侍臣にその講話を記録するよう命じたが、備忘録にするため漢文で書くよう指示している。人民に公布する内容はモンゴル文字で書かせ、外に洩らしてはならない自らの備忘録は漢文で記録させていることから、チンギス・ハンは漢文を理解できたはずで、漢文を読解出来たとすれば、いつ何処で習得したのかと丘は疑問を呈している。

史料・文献
吾妻鏡の記述
高田実によれば、『吾妻鏡』は鎌倉幕府の歴史書であることは疑いがないが、頼朝の右筆（書記）によって書かれておらず、源氏将軍の断絶後、京より藤原氏を迎えた傀儡政権下で、北条氏によって編纂されている。幕府政所、問注所、大江広元の手記、九条兼実の日記『玉葉』、藤原定家の日記『明月記』も少々使われ、一番多いのは『平家物語』などの抜出で、口承文芸を記録した文章は不統一性をもたらしている。それは義経の記述についても同様で、歴史学的な文章と文学的（口承文芸）な部分を並列し、『吾妻鏡』は一等史料として扱えず、それに準ずるものと評価している。
文治5年（1189年）閏4月30日

「［閏四月大］卅日　己未　今日陸奥の国に於て、泰衡源予州［義経を指す］を襲ふ。是れ且勅定に任せ、且は二品の仰せに依て也。予州、民部少輔基成朝臣が衣河の館に在り。泰衡が従兵数百騎、其の所に馳せ至て、合戰す。予州の家人等相防ぐと雖ども、悉く以て敗績す。予州持仏堂に入り、先づ妻（廿二）子（女子四歳）を害し、次に自殺すと云云。／前伊予守従五位下源朝臣義経（義行又た義顕と改め年卅一）。右馬頭義朝々臣の六男、母は九條院の雑仕常盤。［後略］」（原文は漢文、以下同）

同年5月22日、奥州から報告。

「［五月小］廿二日　辛巳　申の刻に、奥州の飛脚参著す。申して云はく、去ぬる月晦日に、民部少輔が館に於て予州を誅す、其の首追て進ずる所也と云云。則ち事の由を奏達せ被れん為めに、飛脚を京都に進ぜ被る。［後略］」

なお、この伝令報告に先立つ5月19日に、鶴岡八幡の塔供養を6月9日に挙行する事が決定されており、頼朝は義経誅殺の報を受け喪に服す必要から延期を京に申し入れたが、すでに京から招く僧や祝いの品々が順次出立・到着していたことから、6月7日には予定通り行う事が決定され、同時に義経の首は途中で留め置くよう奥州に伝令が送られた。
作家の中津文彦は義経の死についてははっきりせず、死んだという確証は何もないとし、また「義経の北行がそうした（泰衡軍をゲリラ部隊として考えていた）大きな戦略目標を胸に秘めてのものだったとしたら、後に残った泰衡らの任務はおのずと明らかになってくる。言うまでもなく、時間稼ぎである」と主張している。
同年6月13日、和田義盛・梶原景時らが立ち会い、義経の首実検が行われた。

「［六月大］十三日　辛丑　泰衡が使者、新田冠者高平、予州の首を腰越の浦に持参し、事の由を言上す。仍て実検を加へん為めに、和田太郎義盛、梶原平三景時等を彼の所に遣さる。各々、甲直垂を著し、甲冑の郎従二十騎を相ひ具す。件の首を黒漆の櫃に納れ、美酒に浸し、高平が僕従二人、之を荷担す。昔の蘇公は、自ら其の糧を担ふ、今の高平は、人をして彼の首を荷は令む。観る者皆双涙を拭ひ、両の袂を湿ほすと云云。」

同年7月から9月の奥州合戦により、奥州藤原氏は滅亡する。しかし、義経襲撃事件から8か月、奥州合戦から3か月後の12月23日、奥州からある風聞（謳歌の説）が報告される。

「［十二月大］廿三日　戊申　奥州の飛脚、去ぬる夜參じ申して云く、予州［義経を指す］并びに木曽左典厩［義仲］の子息［義高］、及び秀衡入道が男等の者有りて、各々同心力合せ令め、鎌倉に発向せんと擬する之由、謳歌の説有りと云云。仍て勢を北陸道に分け遣はす可きの歟之趣、今日其の沙汰有り。深雪之期と為りと雖ども、皆用意を廻らす可く之旨、御書を小諸太郎光兼、佐々木三郎盛綱已下、越後信濃等の国の御家人に遣はさ被ると云云。俊兼、之を奉行す。」

続いて翌12月24日。

「廿四日　己酉　工藤小次郎行光、由利中八維平、宮六兼仗国平等。奥州に発向す。件の国も又た物忩之由し、之を告げ申すに依て、防戰の用意を致す可き之故也。［後略］」

義経や木曽義高、藤原秀衡の子などを名乗る者たちが反乱を起こし、鎌倉を目指しているとの噂が報告され、深雪の時季にもかかわらず、越後信濃等の御家人、翌日には工藤、由利、宮六等の部隊を奥州に派遣、迎撃防戦の準備がなされた。 
文治6年（1190年）正月6日。「義経と号」する大河兼任の名が現れ、その反乱は3月まで続いた。

「［正月小］六日　辛酉　奥州、故泰衡が郎従、大河次郎兼任、以下。去年の窮冬以来、反逆を企て、或は伊予守義経と号し、出羽国海辺庄に出で、或は左馬頭義仲の嫡男朝日冠者と称し、同国山北郡を起ち、各々逆党を結び遂に兼任、嫡子鶴太郎、次男於畿内次郎、并びに七千余騎の凶徒を相具し、鎌倉の方に向ひ、首途せ令め、其の路は、河北、秋田の城等を歴、大関山を越え、多賀国府に出んと擬れて、秋田、大方より、志加の渡りを打ち融る之間、氷俄に消えて、五千余人、忽ち以て溺れ死訖ぬ。天の譴を蒙る歟。［後略］」

東北の文献
柳田国男や五味文彦は、『義経記』は歴史書とは扱えず参考資料であり、「諸国を巡り歩いた法師や山伏によって流布されたもので、京や鎌倉の人々がとうの昔に忘れ果てている間に断片的に民衆の間に育て上げられた文学である」としている。
以下は、その『義経記』の影響を多少受け、完全な偽書ではないが、歴史資料としての信用性は低いとされる古文書。

『義経記』は奥州に山伏たちが人々へ語り伝えた物で、「船弁慶」「義経千本桜」など歌舞伎の題材となっており、創作または物語として余りにも脚色が多く、義経と弁慶との五条大橋での出会いや、高舘で義経を庇いながら立って死ぬ弁慶の最後の場面なども後世の脚色とみることが出来る。五味文彦はどこまでが本当の義経か判別できないとしている。

東北・北海道の義経伝説
『義経記』と義経伝説
いわゆる「判官びいき」（非業の死を遂げた不遇の英雄義経への哀惜の心情）は、軍記物語『義経記』の主題そのものであった。同物語は義経主従など登場人物の感情が生き生きと描かれるなど、人物描写に優れ、今日親しまれている義経及びその周辺の人物像はこの物語に準拠しているとされる。能や幸若舞曲、御伽草子、浮世草子、歌舞伎、人形浄瑠璃など、後世の多くの文芸や演劇に影響を与えた。
五味文彦（日本中世史）は鎌倉時代成立の『曽我物語』が御霊信仰の影響の強い作品であるのに対し、『義経記』にはそれが希薄であることから『義経記』の鎌倉時代成立説に疑義を呈し、鎌倉幕府治下において義経の活躍を描くにはいたらなかったであろうと推測している。また、室町幕府創業に大きく寄与したのが足利尊氏・直義の兄弟であったことから、南北朝時代に頼朝・義経兄弟の活動に目が向けられたのではないか、とした。
また、南北朝期成立の『太平記』巻二十九「将軍上洛事」に、『義経記』にみえる若い時期の義経の行動が記されていることから、『義経記』成立はそれと前後する時期と考えられ、その作者は当事者たちの人柄を直接・間接的にも知っていたとは考えられない。また、物語の下地となりうる軍中記を利用したとも考えられていない。さらに、作中の行動のあちこちに矛盾が生じていることも指摘されており、歴史資料としてではなく物語として扱うのが妥当とされる。なお、『弁慶物語』の成立も応永から永享にかけての時期（1394年-1440年）と考えられている。

アイヌの伝承と御曹子島渡説話
江戸時代には義経北行伝説が成立するが、その原型となったのは室町時代の御伽草子にみられる説話「御曹子島渡」である。これは、若き義経が藤原秀衡より、北の国の都に住む「かねひら大王」を調伏し、所蔵する「大日の法」なる巻物を手に入れるよう勧められ、四国の土佐の港から出帆、神仏の加護を得て、半身半馬の人々の住む「王せん島」、「裸人の島」、「女護の島」、「小さ子の住む島」、当時「渡島」と呼ばれていた「蝦夷が島」（北海道）を経て「千島」の喜見城に辿りつき、大王の娘と契るがその過程で様々な怪異を体験するという物語である。同説話は、当時渡党など蝦夷地を舞台に活躍する集団の存在や、活発な北方海域の交易の様相が広く中央にも知られるようになった事実を反映したものとされている。
宝永7年（1710年）の幕府巡見使・松宮観山による、蝦夷通詞からの聞書きを基にした『蝦夷談筆記』（『日本庶民生活史料集成』第4巻）には、「（義経が）蝦夷の大将の娘に馴染み、秘蔵の巻物を取たるといふ事」をアイヌがユーカラに謡っている旨が記されている。また、文化5年（1808年）の最上徳内『渡島筆記』は「我々も先祖はよみかきするわざをわきまえたけれど、ホウガンどのにその巻物を獲られてより初めて字を作ることを知らざるもの成たり」とし、義経が巻物を奪ったせいでアイヌは文字を失ったとしている。イザベラ・バードも注記した同様の話は明治初期に英国人宣教師ジョン・バチェラーが採取したアイヌの口碑にもあり、巻物は「トラ・ノ・マキモン」と称されたが、それは和人が伝え広めたとされる。巻物にはアイヌの文字が記され、それが白紙になったことでアイヌの文字が失われ、従って義経がアイヌの文字を奪ったとされた。これは『御曹子島渡』の、義経が大王の大日の法の巻物を天女の力を借りて写し終えると白紙になったという物語を擬えたもので、原田信男はアイヌの英雄伝説が和人通訳者によって義経に置き換えられ、それが交互に伝えられることでアイヌの間にも広まり、和人には義経伝説として発展したと考えられるとした。すでに新井白石の時代にこうした伝承が成立していた。
語り物を楽しみとしていたアイヌの人々には日本の口承文芸が受容され、彼らの昔話に採り入れられていた（ウエペケレ＝アイヌの口承文芸）。近世初期の『異本義経記』には室町期に武士や商人が蝦夷地を訪れ、活発な活動を行っていた旨が記され、交易などを目的に蝦夷地に渡った和人が少なからず存在していた。彼らは昔話の語り手でもあり、様々な日本の物語がアイヌの人々の間に口伝され、『御曹子島渡』の一部がアイヌの人々の間にシサム・ウエケペレの一つとして入りこんでいたと考えられている。
また、原田信男は弁慶岬（弁慶崎）の地名はアイヌ語の「ベルケイ」と云い、これは「裂けた所」の意味で、海食地形のことであり、ここで義経一行が逗留中に余興として弁慶が相撲をとったと伝わるが、アイヌ人が弁慶と命名したのではなく、和人が義経伝説に因んで勝手に命名したに過ぎないとする（小シーボルト蝦夷見聞記）。間宮林蔵や、永田方正、岩崎克己らも同様の指摘をしている。元文4年（1739年）成立の鉱山師・坂倉源次郎による『北海随筆』（『日本庶民生活資料集成』第4巻）には、「弁慶崎」から義経が「北高麗」に渡ったとする伝承が記されている。また、義経をオキクルミとする一方、弁慶をもう一人の英雄サマユンクルに擬えることも広く行われていた。この地方の民話に詳しい北星学園大学文学部教授阿部敏夫は、義経はアイヌの住居を訪ね歩いたのではないかとしている。

義経神社
イザベラ・バードも訪れた北海道にある義経神社（沙流郡平取町本町、現社殿造営・遷座は1961年）は、義経を祭神としているが、これには諸説ある。寛政11年（1799年）、幕吏の近藤重蔵が蝦夷地探検で当地を訪れた際、義経伝説があることを知って建立したという。また、近くの新冠郡新冠町には判官館城跡と呼ばれるチャシ（砦）跡があり、近藤は当初この地に義経神社を勧請したと伝わっている。社伝によれば、義経一行は蝦夷地白神（現在の福島町）に渡り、西の海岸を北上し、羊蹄山を廻って、日高ピラトリ（現在の平取町）のアイヌ集落に落ち着き、そこで農耕、舟の製作法、機織りなどを教えたとされる。アイヌの民から「ハンガンカムイ」（判官の神ほどの意味か）あるいは「ホンカンカムイ」と慕われたこという説もある。他にアイヌの民の間ではアイヌの民から様々な宝物を奪った大悪人とされていたり、義経に裏切られた女の子（メノコ）が自殺を遂げたとされる場所も存在する。アイヌの酋長ベンリウクが義経を祀ったのが最初という言い伝えもある。（ボルテ・チノ日本の心 2号）

北東北沿岸に残る義経伝説
佐々木勝三は奥州史談会や岩手史談会会員、郷士史家として活動し、高校で教鞭を執る傍ら義経生存説の検証に取り組み、平泉以北に残っていた義経伝承を丹念に調査した。昭和33年（1958年）に『義経は生きていた』（東北社）を発表し、91歳で没するまで『源義経蝦夷亡命追跡の記』『成吉思汗は義経』などの研究成果を発表した。
佐々木らは地元に点在する伝説を丹念に拾い集めた著書の中で、義経生脱説を示す古文書の多くは、江戸時代中後期の盛岡藩の役人や学者が地元の神官や百姓に請われて書いたものであり、そのうちの明和2年（1765年）成立の『奥州南部封域志』には、『義経記』や『鎌倉実記』など当時既に広まっていた書物を下敷きに、義経は金王朝に逃れて将軍になったと記されているという。

修験道と義経伝説
義経伝説が色濃く残る岩手県宮古市の黒森山は羽黒派修験と密接な関わりを持つとされ、国の重要無形民俗文化財である黒森神楽は山伏神楽の代表的なものである。三陸沿岸北部は山伏の一大根拠地であり、この地の義経伝説は「弁慶の大般若経」「鈴木重家の笈」など修験道との関わりを示すものが多い。これら修験者の残した道具や巻物が、判官びいきの心情と結びつき伝説を形作っていったと考えられる。さらに江戸時代中期の盛岡藩の儒学者・高橋東洋（高橋子績）が、これらの伝説をまとめた『黒森山稜誌』『奥州南部封域志』などを執筆したことで、現在につながる義経伝説を成立させることとなる。

北行伝承の検証

歴史的背景・その他
奥州藤原氏の興隆と北方交易
平安時代後半に台頭した奥州藤原氏は、それ以前の安倍氏や出羽清原氏の権益を引き継ぎ、陸奥湾沿岸（外が浜）地域を外港とする、アイヌを介した北方交易（北東アジア大陸を含む北方世界との交流・交易）に権力基盤の一部を置いていたとされる。
藤原基衡は、毛越寺本尊の制作を仏師・運慶に依頼した際、その費用一体分は円金100両、鷲羽100尻、アザラシの皮60余枚、安達絹1000疋、希婦の細布2000端、糠部の駿馬50頭等々を京へ収めたほか、中央政界の実力者藤原頼長の荘園も管理し、海外からの宝物を納めた。当時、海獣の毛皮は装身具に、鷲の羽根は矢羽に欠かせなかった。
中尊寺金色堂の仏壇や4本の巻柱、長押にアフリカゾウの象牙や夜光貝や紫檀が使われており、当時の奥州藤原氏の隆盛ぶりと海外とのつながりが証明されている。この地方は朝廷の中央文化とは別にアジアとの交易ルートを有し、独立的経済圏を形成していた。

義経北行伝承地（岩手県の場合）
モンゴル史研究におけるチンギス・カン像
あくまでも義経＝成吉思汗説は日本起源であり、モンゴルに同伝説は伝わっていないことから、従来のモンゴル史研究ではチンギス・カンを義経の後半生とする見解は当然存在しない。

身体的特徴・前半生の事績
源義経は源義朝の八男ないし九男とされるのに対し、のちにチンギス・カンとなるテムジンはイェスゲイの長男であり、9歳のとき父を失って苦労した、という『元朝秘史』に記されている逸話はよく知られている。小谷部は「ともに小柄」としているが、チンギス・カンはモンゴル関係の歴史書には「堂々たる体躯」であったと記録されており、小谷部の主張とは合致しない。
モンゴル史研究者・杉山正明はチンギス・カンの肖像として一般に知られている台北の故宮博物院蔵のチンギス・カンの肖像を例にあげて、これが実際のチンギス・カンの容姿を反映したものか疑問視している。また、チンギス・カンの子孫たちが作らせた東西の文献には「波乱に満ちた彼の前半生について、様々な逸話、苦心譚を人馬が激しく交わる『血湧き肉踊る』活劇」として語り伝えてはいるが、「前半生と容姿の真偽は闇の中にあり、確かだといえることは、1203年の秋にケレイトのオン・カンを奇襲でチンギス・カンが倒し、モンゴルの東半分を制圧してからだ」と述べている。
満州・モンゴル史研究者の岡田英弘も、「1195年ケレイトのオン・ハーンとその部下のチンギス・ハーン（このときはテムジン）は、金と同盟してタタール人に大規模な征伐作戦を行い、金から恩賞を受けている（ウルジャ河の戦い：引用者注）。これが初めて歴史に登場した事件であり、これ以前のチンギス・ハーンの事跡ははっきりとは分からない」と述べている。

血統の伝承
杉山も岡田もチンギス・カンにまつわる伝記資料上の事績やエピソードの、説話的要素と実際の事績との不分明さを意識して「前半生は謎に包まれている」としているが、チンギス・カンがイェスゲイやバルタン・バアトル、カブル・カンの血統であるという伝承自体は否定していない。むしろ、両者ともその血統に関する伝承を前提として論じている。特に杉山はテムジンが「名門の傍系」であったために、君主としての権力を確立する過程で、アルタンやクチャルといった同じキヤト氏族内の嫡流の人々を排除していった点に注意を促している。

君主の推戴・承認制
考古学者・江上波夫によれば、遊牧民族・騎馬民族国家の君主は、同じ国家に所属する氏・部族長らによって君主として推戴・承認を必要とする推戴・承認制と呼べる制度があり、「軍事的・外交的活動の最高指導者としての適格性が君主の資格として、つねに非常に重視されていた」と指摘している。「内陸アジアの遊牧騎馬民族国家の君主に『勇猛な（バガトル）』『賢明な（ビルゲ）』などといった資質にもとづく名」を負わせたことは、これら遊牧騎馬民族の動的な社会に深く根ざしていた現実主義合理主義的な側面から導き出された結果と見ている。
しかし同時に、氏・部族長らによって君主として推戴・承認を受ける遊牧騎馬民族国家の君主候補者は、最初の君主を輩出した支配・中核氏族の成員に限られる、という原則が形成されており、さらに実際にはその君主の男系近親者に選択範囲が狭められる、という現象も生じている。従って、第1に「内陸アジアの遊牧騎馬民族国家」の君主の選定には、「軍事的・外交的活動の最高指導者としての適格性」が氏・部族長らにより推戴・承認されるという現実主義・合理主義的な側面と、第2に「最初の君主と同じ男系の氏族でかつ近親者でなければならない」という血統主義的な側面という、両側面が考慮されることになった。
こうした原理的な矛盾を孕みつつ推戴・承認制は、匈奴の時代からチンギス・カンの時代までほとんど改変されることなく続いたものであり、それはしばしば王族や支配氏族間の内訌の原因ともなり、さらには国家の分裂、衰退の原因ともなった、と述べている。

チンギス・カンの称号の由来
チンギス・カンの称号の由来については諸説あり、現在もその意味は良くわかっていない。1206年の即位時、コンゴタン部族出身の巫者ココチュ・テプ・テングリによって「チンギス・カン」という称号が贈られたことは、『集史』や『元史』『元朝秘史』などの諸資料で共通して記録されている。この巫者（シャーマン、カム）ココチュ・テプ・テングリとは、『元朝秘史』にはチンギスの父イェスゲイに親しく仕えていた従者モンリク・エチゲの四男であったとされている（但し『集史』ではモンリク・エチゲはチンギスの母ホエルンの再婚相手だったため「エチゲ（父）」と呼ばれていたと述べている）。また『集史』によると、「チング（چينگ chīng）」はモンゴル語で「強大な」を意味し、「チンギズ（چينگگيز Chīnggīz）」はその複数形で、ペルシア語での「王者中の王者」（پادشاه پادشاهان pādshāh-i pādshāhān）と同じ意味であるとしている。後代のクビライ家の後裔であるサガン・セチェンによるモンゴル語歴史書『蒙古源流』（1662年成立）には、「テムジンが28歳の甲寅の年（1194年）にでケルレン河のコデー・アラルでハーン（Qaγan）位に即いた時に、その日から三日目の朝にわたってテムジンのゲル（家屋）の前の石に止まった五色の瑞鳥が、「『チンギス、チンギス』とさえずったので、中央で唱える名、『スト・ボグダ・チンギス・ハーン（Sutu Boγda Činggis Qaγan）』として、各方面で有名になった」と記している。
また、『元朝秘史』には「海内の天子」という意味もあるとしている。ソ連邦時代のブリヤート・モンゴル人の学者ドルジ・バンザロフによると、「チンギス」はシャーマニズムにおける光の精霊の名前、Hajir Činggis Tenggeri に由来するとする説を唱えた。また、フランスの東洋学者ペリオはテュルク語での「海」（tengiz）を意味するとしている。

現存資料に見られるチンギス・カンの系譜
チンギス・カンの生年に関しては各資料により記述が異なり、1155年説、1162年、1167年説の諸説があり、確定されていない。しかし、チンギス・カン自身の家系は諸資料ではっきりとした記載があり、チンギス・カンの曾祖父カブル・カンを始祖とするキヤト氏族の家系については、諸資料間のおおよその親族情報は一致している。
当時の家系図は書き換えも多く正確性に欠けるともされるが、中央ユーラシアの遊牧民は個々の遊牧集団の指導者層の家系に関してはうるさく、匈奴においては中核氏族である攣鞮氏が単于位を、突厥においては阿史那氏が可汗位および主要な地位を独占し、それ以外の氏族はこの地位に就けなかったことが知られている
祖先の系譜については、『元朝秘史』に取材した井上靖の小説などの影響で、日本などではモンゴル部族の先祖として「ボルテ・チノ」との関係が強調される傾向にあるが、実際にモンゴル帝国や中央アジア・イランやモンゴル本土で存続したその後継諸政権においてチンギス・カン家の先祖として重要視されていたのは、むしろその子孫で日月の精霊と交わってモンゴルの支配階層の諸部族の祖となったとされるアラン・コアとその息子ボドンチャルであった。また、上記のように、チンギスの属すキヤト氏族は『元朝秘史』、モンゴル帝国の正史的な位置づけで編纂された『集史』などによるとチンギスの曾祖父カブル・カンに始まるが、『集史』の記述に従えばチンギスの出自はカブル・カンの次男バルタン・バアトルの三男イェスゲイ・バアトルの長男とされている。アラン・コアからカブル・カンまでの系譜については資料によって異同が多いものの、上記以外でも『蒙古源流』、『五族譜』や『ムイッズ・アル＝アンサーブ』などの歴史書や系譜資料が13、14世紀以降に多く編纂されたが、どの資料もカブル・カン→バルタン・バアトル→イェスゲイ・バアトル→テムジン（チンギス・カン）という流れは共通して記録している。
チンギス・カンに関する現存資料からは、源義経と関連づけるべき必然性や証拠は存在しないため、同一人物説は実証的に証明することはできない。またそれ以上に、先述の遊牧民の政治文化の伝統ゆえに、同説は中央ユーラシア史の研究者からは否定されている。

話題
1995年、日本通で知られた仏大統領シラクは、エリゼ宮での昼食会で日本の要人に「源義経は平泉で亡くなったのではなく、モンゴルに逃れ、チンギス・ハンになったという伝説」を話題にした
映画『モンゴル』（2008年4月5日日本公開）で、浅野忠信はチンギス・ハンを演じることについて「ロシアの監督と日本人の俳優と、どこにもモンゴル人がいないのにチンギス・ハーンを描くと聞いて、逆に興味がわきました。以前、源義経を『五条霊戦記 GOJOE』で演じたことがあり、日本では義経がハーンになったという噂があって面白いなと思っていたので、ぜひやらせて欲しいと思いました」と出演理由を述べ、監督のセルゲイ・ボドロフも「チンギス・ハン役は日本人でなければならない」というコメントを出した。
宮脇淳子『世界史のなかの蒙古襲来 モンゴルから見た高麗と日本』扶桑社（2019年）に曰く、「駐日モンゴル大使館の人たちがこぼしていました。会う日本人会う日本人が、必ずといっていいくらいに話題にするのが『義経=成吉思汗説』だと。モンゴル人のほうはしかたがないので、適当に話を合わせるらしいのですが、ほとほと困るというのです。／モンゴルの英雄チンギス・ハーンが、史実でもなんでもないのに、源義経という日本人だといわれたのでは、モンゴル人はイヤな思いをするだけです」とのこと。

衣川遺跡群の発掘調査
近年の学術調査で衣川の場所が特定されつつあり、その発掘調査から藤原基成の宿舘である衣川館が燃えていないことが判った（ボルテ・チノ日本の心）。東北芸術工科大学の入間田宣夫は、『吾妻鏡』等の史料を基に「基成の館そのものは、火災ほかの被害を受けることもなく、基成一家の暮らしには、なんら変化が無かったことが察知できる。それどころか、義経の居宅、『持仏堂』でさえ、火災などの被害を受けることが無かった」としている。「義経の首はなんら損傷もなく、勿論焼疵もなく、鎌倉に運ばれ首実検を供えられることが出来たのではないか、今までの一面が火の海になったというイメージが作られていたが、それは間違いでありそれが不思議でならない」と述べている。
『吾妻鏡』や『玉葉』には一言も燃えたとする記載はない。『義経記』だけに「猛火は程なく御殿につきけり」等と書かれ、この書が創作であるということが判り、その影響の結果である。火災が無かったということはすなわち、燃えていないどころか、合戦もなかったとする方が自然であると云う見方を近年はされている。

類話
夜泣き石のように、石が声を発したり人を化かしたという伝承は各地にある。岡山県苫田郡泉村箱（後の奥津町、現・鏡野町）の「杓子岩」（しゃくしいわ）は、夜に通行人に対して「味噌をくれ」と言って杓子を突き出したという。同県御津郡円城村（現・同県加賀郡吉備中央町）にあった「こそこそ岩」という巨岩は、夜に人が通りかかると「こそこそ」と音を立てたという。香川県琴南町（現・まんのう町）美合の山中の「オマンノ岩」は、近くを人が通りかかると、中から老婆が現れて「おまんの母でございます」と名乗ったという。長野県北安曇郡小谷村大所の「物岩（ものいわ）」は、かつて命を狙われている者が付近を通りかかったとき「殺されるぞ」と声を出し、命を救ったといわれる。
古来から日本人は石や岩を霊的なものとして崇拝しており、そうした霊的な存在は妖怪にとって格好の住処であったとされることが、こうした伝承の背景と考えられている。
古くは奈良時代から例が見られ、『続日本紀』宝亀元年（770年）2月23日条に、「西大寺東塔の心礎を壊し捨てたが、石の大きさは一丈四方余り、厚さ九尺で、東大寺の東の飯盛山にあった石であった。初め数千人で引き動かしたが、一日に数歩分しか進まず、時には唸り声がした。そこで人夫を増やして九日かかってやっと運んだ。その後、加工されたが、男女の巫（みこ）の中に石の祟りがあるかもしれないという者があった。そこで柴を積んで石を焼き、三十石余りの酒を注いで、細かく砕いて道路に捨てた。一か月後、天皇が病となった。占った結果、砕いた石の祟りと出たので、石を拾い、清らかな土地に置き、人馬がふまないようにした」と記述され、古代から石が声を発し、祟るものという認識があったことがわかる。また、記・紀神話においても、天地開闢して間もない頃は、「石草木ものいう」という表現がみられる。

概要
夜舟主は島根県の隠岐の島の海に住んでいる大蛇のような姿をした妖怪で、毎年6月13日に生贄として若い娘を住人たちに差し出させていた。生贄を出ししぶると、夜舟主は怒って、島に嵐を呼んで人々を困らせていた。隠岐に島流しにされた父親に会おうという決意で島にやって来た常世（とこよ）という名の少女は、生贄として捧げられそうになっていた娘を救い、海に突入して夜舟主を退治した。
常世の父親の織部志摩（おりべしま）は、鎌倉幕府の執権が北条高時だった頃の武士だと語られている。話の中で、北条高時は原因不明の病気になっているのだが、夜舟主を退治したときに常世が海底から引き上げて来た謎の木像は、高時の容貌によく似ていた。これが高時を病気にしていた呪いの木像だったことが判明したことで、織部志摩は罪を許されたとされる。

収録書籍
この夜舟主の話は、明治時代に来日をしたイギリス人・リチャード・ゴードン・スミスがまとめた英文の書籍『日本の昔話と伝説』（1918年）のなかに「隠岐の島の話」（A story of Oki island）として日本人画家による挿絵と共に収録されている。同書が各地で長年にわたって翻訳出版されていることによって、夜舟主は日本の海の悪神（Evil god）のひとつ「Yofune-Nushi」として海外における知名度のほうが高く、逆に日本では近現代にかけてあまり親しまれてきていなかったという状況にもなっている。

あらすじ
文明3年（1471年）、蓮如が北国筋の勧化のために、越前国吉崎道場（吉崎観音とも）において、朝夕に化導したとき、加賀国、能登国、越中国、越後国、信濃国、出羽国、奥羽の信者が説教を聴聞するために群衆した。その中で、越前国二袴の百姓である与惣治夫婦は、ひとえに蓮如上人の高徳を慕い、教化によって即得往生の果を得ようと、暇を見ては吉崎に通った。これを見て、与惣治の母は、無信心や邪見の心から、明け暮れの後世願いに通い詰めることは家業の妨げであるとして、吉崎通いを止めさせようと考えた。
文明4年（1472年）2月20日の夜、与惣治は外出し、嫁ひとりが参聴した帰途、今日こそ時節到来と、母は、ひそかに氏神奉納の面を盗みだし、白いかたびらをまとい、鬼神をまねて脅そうと、竹薮に身を潜ませて待った。そんなことはつゆ知らず、嫁が称名しながら来かかったところに、鬼形の母は現れて呼び止め、「お前は母の意に逆らい、吉崎参りしたが、その不孝の罪からは逃れられない。自分は白山権現の使いだが、今日より母の言葉に従い、改心しなければ許さないぞ」と脅した。しかし、母が薮の中から出ようとした時、服がいばらに引っかかり離れず、嫁は怯えて顧みもせずに逃げ帰った。
事の不首尾に怒った母は、日頃企んだことの失敗を残念がりつつ、被った面を取ろうとしたが、顔に張り付きどうやっても取れない。嫁は我が家に逃げ帰り、帰宅した夫に事の次第を語り、また母の不在を心配して訪ねに出て鬼形の母に会った。
母は我が子に呼びかけ、企んだ恥を泣き叫んだ。与惣治は「懺悔はその罪を滅すと聞いている。この上は吉崎御坊に上人をたずね、御化導にあいなされ」と勧めた。母は御坊を訪ね、上人の前にひざまづいて教化を受け、また先非を悔いて懺悔した。すると肉まで付着したと思われた鬼女の面は、たちまち落ち離れたという。
その時の面と言い伝えられているものが、西念寺に伝わっている。

戯曲
この伝説は1726年（享保11年）に操浄瑠璃『北条時頼記』にエピソードとして取り込まれた。また1799年（寛政11年）には辰岡萬作によって歌舞伎に脚色され、『雪国嫁威谷』と題して大阪で上演されている。
市川斎入右団治の上方狂言では、般若の面を被った母親が鎌で嫁を殺してしまい、面が張り付いたのち自害、後生を蓮如上人が弔ったという内容に脚色された。

歴史
嫁殺しの池にまつわる伝説として、要約すると以下のような物語が言い伝えられている。

むかし、意地悪な姑が嫁に田植えを一日で済ませるよう命じた。嫁は独りで朝早くから作業に取りかかったが、ついに日が暮れてしまう。嫁は天に向かって太陽が沈むのを待ってほしいと懇願した。すると願いが通じたのか、太陽は再び昇り、嫁は田植えをやり遂げることができた。間もなく太陽は沈み、嫁はその場に倒れ絶命した。嫁の周りでは水が噴き上がり、やがて池となった。

上で示した要約では嫁が田植えを完遂したとあるが、結局一日で終えられずに疲れ果て死んだという話もある。さらに嫁の死後、赤い米が採れるようになったという話もある。ただ、物語の最後にある「水が噴き上がり池となった」という部分は、池が誕生した以降に付け加えられたものであると考えられている。実際、物語は池ができる前から言い伝えられており、池となっている場所はかつて水田だった土地である。
地元ではこうした言い伝えから、死んだ嫁の祟りをおそれ、慰霊のためのほこらを造った。それは現在でも池のほとりの小高い丘の上にある。そのほか、人手を募ってでも田植えを一日で終えるようにしていたところもあり、嫁と姑との関係を良好に保つよう努めているともいう。

周辺
嫁殺しの池は長野県長野市信更町三水字村漆、長野県道70号長野信州新線沿いにある。JR 信越本線および篠ノ井線、しなの鉄道の篠ノ井駅より信州新町行きのバスに乗り30分程度。池を通過し、琅鶴湖（水内ダム湖）に架けられた久米路橋を渡ると国道19号新久米路トンネル手前に出る。

周辺の道路は道幅がせまく入り組んでおり、集落で暮らす住民の生活道路でもあることから交通量も相応にあるので運転には注意を要する。湖畔にあるお助け地蔵菩薩は、かつて池に乗用車が転落した交通事故を悼むとともに、交通安全への願いから建立されたものである。

大唐西域記
『大唐西域記』11巻　僧伽羅国（シンガラ）においてセイロン島（現スリランカ）の建国伝説として記述される。500人の羅刹女のいる国に難破して配下の500人の商人とたどりついた僧伽羅は、1人命からがら逃げ出すも妻にした羅刹女が追ってきたので、羅刹国と羅刹女のことを国王に説明するも信じてもらえず、国王の他多くの者が食べられてしまう。そこで僧伽羅は逆に羅刹国に攻めこみ羅刹女をたおし、そこの王となり国名にその名がついたという。

ヒンドゥー教
ヒンドゥー教の神話には羅刹の国としてランカーが登場する。
叙事詩『ラーマーヤナ』はコーサラ国の王子ラーマがランカーへ連れ去られた妻シーターを奪還するために羅刹の王ラーヴァナへ戦いを挑む様を描く。

日本
日本では東女国（とうじょこく）とも書かれ、後には女護ヶ島伝説とも結びついて、女人島（にょにんじま）・女護国（にょごこく）などとも呼称された。
『今昔物語集』巻五に『大唐西域記』と同様の説話がある。天竺の僧伽羅が500人の商人達とともにこの島に漂着したが、この島の住民は全て鬼の姿をした女性であった。500人の商人達は全員女鬼によって殺されたが、伽羅だけは仏の加護によって島を脱出したとされている。
中世の行基式日本図において、日本の東方あるいは南方海上に記されており、人が足を踏み入れば、決して帰ってこられない土地であると信じられるようになった。また、この知識が中国にも伝わり、日本を描いた地図には「東女国」の名で雁道と並んで描かれているものがある。また、1585年のフィレンツェで製作された地図にも日本の南方に羅刹国らしき島が描かれている。
しかし、大航海時代以後には正確な地理知識の普及もあって羅刹国の記述のない地図も出現するようになり、遅くても江戸時代中期には地図から姿を消すことになった。

ロシア
17世紀にロシア人がシベリアからアムール川流域へ進出した結果、当時満洲を支配していた清国と接触した。清国にとってロシア人は未知の民族であったため“ロシア”の音写として「羅刹（ロチャ）」と記録された。「羅刹」表記は後に「俄羅斯（オロス）」表記に取って代わられ廃れた。

あらすじ
六部とは、「日本廻国大乗妙典六十六部経聖」の略で、六十六回写経した法華経を持って六十六箇所の霊場をめぐり、一部ずつ奉納して回る巡礼僧のこと。六部ではなく修験者や托鉢僧や座頭や遍路、あるいは行商人や単なる旅人とされている場合もある。ストーリーには様々なバリエーションが存在するが、広く知られている内容は概ね以下のとおりである。
ある村の貧しい百姓家に六部がやって来て一夜の宿を請う。その家の夫婦は親切に六部を迎え入れ、もてなした。その夜、六部の荷物の中に大金の路銀が入っているのを目撃した百姓は、どうしてもその金が欲しくてたまらなくなる。そして、とうとう六部を謀殺して亡骸を処分し、金を奪った。
その後、百姓は奪った金を元手に商売を始める・田畑を担保に取って高利貸しをする等、何らかの方法で急速に裕福になる。夫婦の間に子供も生まれた。ところが、生まれた子供はいくつになっても口が利けなかった。そんなある日、夜中に子供が目を覚まし、むずがっていた。小便がしたいのかと思った父親は便所へ連れて行く。きれいな月夜、もしくは月の出ない晩、あるいは雨降りの夜など、ちょうどかつて六部を殺した時と同じような天候だった。すると突然、子供が初めて口を開き、「お前に殺されたのもこんな晩だったな」と言ってあの六部の顔つきに変わっていた。
ここまでで終わる場合もあれば、驚いた男が頓死する、繁栄していた家が再び没落する、といった後日談が加わる場合もある。

類話
「かつて殺した相手が、自分の子供に生まれ変わり、罪を暴く言葉を発する」というモチーフには、他にさまざまな類話がある。川合勇太郎が1930年刊行の『津軽むがしこ集』（東奥日報社）に「六部ば殺した話」を収録して以降、類話の報告は、水沢謙一（1956年）、野村純一（1967年）、稲田浩二・福田晃（68年）、京都府立総合資料館（1972年）、佐藤義則（74年）、佐々木徳夫（75年）、水沢謙一（76年）によって重ねられている。

もう半分
落語の演目『もう半分』は、舞台を都市部に移した形で、六部殺しと似た流れになっている。夫婦で営む江戸の居酒屋に、老爺の客がやって来た。老爺は半杯ずつ注文してちびちびと飲み、金包みを置き忘れて帰って行った。夫婦が中を確かめると、貧しい身なりに不釣合いな大金が入っている。しばらくすると老爺が慌てて引き返し、娘を売って作った大事な金だから返してくれと泣きついた。しかし、夫婦は知らぬ存ぜぬを通して追い出した。老爺は川へ身投げして死んだ。その後、奪った金を元手に店は繁盛し、夫婦には子供も生まれた。だが、子供は生まれながらに老爺のような不気味な顔で、しかも何かに怯えたように乳母が次々と辞めていく。不審に思った亭主が確かめると、子供は夜中に起き出して行灯の油を舐めている。「おのれ迷ったか！」と亭主が声を掛けると、子供は振り返って油皿を差し出し「もう半分」。

夢十夜
「こんな夢を見た」で始まる夏目漱石の散文『夢十夜』の「第三夜」にも、六部殺しの民話の影響がうかがえる。夢の中で自分の子をおぶって暗い田圃道を歩いており、子供は盲目なのに周囲の状況をよく分かっていて、大人びた口調で話している。歩を進めるごとに思い出してはならない何かを思い出すような気がし、「ちょうどこんな晩だったな」という子供の独り言を不気味に思う。やがて山の一本杉の前に着き、「ここで御前がおれを殺したのは今からちょうど百年前だね」と背中の子供が言った。過去の殺人を自覚したとたん、背中の子供が急に石地蔵のように重くなった。

持田の百姓
殺した相手が金品を持った大人ではなく、幼子の間引きだというパターンも存在する。小泉八雲の『知られぬ日本の面影』に出てくる「持田の百姓」では、出雲の貧しい百姓が産まれた子供を6人まで次々と川へ捨て、その間にようやく少し余裕のある暮らしが出来るようになる。そうして7人目の男児は跡取りとして育てることにし、溺愛した。ところがある日、月夜の庭へ散歩に出ると、抱いた乳呑み児の我が子が「わしを最後に捨てた夜もこんな月夜だったね」と口を利き、またすぐに普通の赤子に戻った。百姓は出家した。

都市伝説
持田の百姓のパターンがさらにアレンジされたものに、現代風の都市伝説がある。低所得の若いカップルに子供が生まれ（夫婦の初子が奇形児だったとするものもある）、フェリーに乗った際、水に落として殺した。その後また子供が生まれ、今度は溺愛した。その子を連れてフェリーに乗っていた時、急におしっこがしたいと言い出す。仕方なく抱きかかえて体を手すりの外に出すと、振り返って「今度は落とさないでね」と1人目の顔で言った。

民俗学的分析
集落の外からやって来る旅人は異人（まれびと）であり、閉鎖的な農村への来訪者はしばしば新しい情報・未知の技術・珍しい物品をもたらす媒介者であった。福をもたらす存在として客人を歓待し、客人が去った後に繁栄を得る「まれびと信仰」に根ざした民話は、古くから各地に存在する。一方で、円満に珍品を譲り受けるケースばかりでなく、客人とトラブルを起こし、強引に奪い取って繁栄を達成したケースもある。六部殺しは、こうした「まれびと殺し」の類型に属す。
あるいは、村内の一つの家が急に繁盛してきた場合、ムラ社会の嫉みにより「あれだけ儲かるには何かあくどい手段をとったに違いない」といった周囲からのいわれのない中傷を招き、直前の平常とは違った出来事（「そういえばあの家に旅人が泊まった」「旅人がその後どこへ行ったのか誰も知らない」）と結び付けて、まれびと殺し譚が出来上がることもあり得る。
また、旅人を泊めた後その一家に生まれた子が旅人の面影を宿しているのは、妻女を夜伽に提供する「客人(まろうど)婚」との関連も考えられる。
さらに、江戸時代には実際に、旅人を装って他人の家に入り泥棒を働いたり、道連れとして他の旅人に声を掛け仲間のいる宿へ誘導して金品を脅し取るなど、種々の形態での胡麻の蠅（護摩の灰）も横行し、素性の知れない他人と一緒に家で寝泊りすることへの潜在的な警戒感も背景にあった。

椀貸伝説の例
概要
近世以前の日本では、家に家族に必要な数以上の食器を持たなかったため、婚礼など人数が集まる催しの際に余所から膳や椀を借りるという状況はしばしば発生した。
椀貸伝説は奥羽から九州まで日本の広い範囲に伝搬しているが、特に中部地方や北関東の山沿いなどに多く伝わっている。概ね上記の例と同じ筋書きだが小異は多く、貸してくれる相手は童子や河童、龍、女神、お地蔵様や、上記の事例のように正体不明であったり様々である。
貸してくれる場所は淵や滝、岩や山陰の洞穴、隠れ里に直接取りに行く場合もあり、やはり様々である。比較すると水に因む場所が多く、水神少童譚や水神信仰との関連が考えられる伝説も多い。物語には既に膳椀を貸してもらえる関係ができている場合や、椀が川の上流から流れてくるなどして異界や隠れ里を発見する場合もある。千葉県印旛郡栄町の龍角寺岩屋古墳や、同県同郡酒々井町のカンカンムロ横穴群など、古墳の横穴式石室や横穴墓が伝説地となっている事例もある。なお酒々井町（カンカンムロ）の事例では、最初に碗貸しを祈願する相手は弁財天だが、実際に碗や膳を貸してくる横穴墓の中にいる存在は正体不明である。
この伝説には、不心得者が返さなかったとされる椀や、反故にした証文などが残っている家や地域がある。それらの品々の中には木地師との関係をうかがわせるものがあり、木地師との交易の際に聞いた口上が伝説になったという見方がある。また、膳椀を村の共有財産としている地域では、借りたものを盗むな、壊すなという戒めを含んだ説話であるという見方もある。

「沈黙交易」説を巡って
椀貸伝説が異族との無言貿易を表したものだという説には民俗学者の中で賛否がある。
1917年（大正6年）に人類学者の鳥居龍蔵が『人類学雑誌』において、椀貸伝説を当事者が接触せず言葉を交わさずに交易を行う「沈黙交易（Silent tradeの訳語」であると指摘した。これに対して1918年（大正7年）には柳田国男が『東京日日新聞』に「隠れ里」を発表し、椀貸伝説は貸借関係に過ぎず、さらに相手は神であることから信仰現象であるとし、竜宮伝説や隠れ里伝説など「異郷観念」の表現形態であると論じた。
戦後には1954年（昭和29年）に北見俊夫が日本全国の椀貸伝説の事例を集成しつつ、これを「沈黙交易」とすることを否定している。一方で、1979年には栗本慎一郎が『経済人類学』において椀貸伝説は「沈黙交易」であり、交易の原始的形態であるとしている。
「沈黙交易」を「交易の原初的形態」と見る点に関しては、同年に岡正雄が『異人その他』において「沈黙交易」は交易の原始的形態ではなく交換の特殊型に過ぎず、客人歓待を前提とした「好意的贈答」の習慣であるとした。

縁記
外之原町の街道の左手に牛臥山林昌寺がある。廻間に住んでいた林昌則という人は、猟師であった。ある日、いつものように弓矢を持ち山深く入ったが、日が落ちてきたので帰ることにした。日が落ち空は暗くなり、星がまばらに出てきた。迷ってしまった。道の分かれ目もわからない。月が出るのを待つうちに、いつとはなく眠ってしまった。何となく、あたりにぱっと光がさしたので驚いて目を覚ますと、月が出たのではなく、こぶし大の赤い火の玉が次第に自分に近づいてくる。何とも不思議な光物であった。このような物を見たのは初めてだった。きっと狐か狸のしわざだと思い、弓に矢をつがえ放った。矢が火の玉を射貫くと、たちまち火の玉は二つに割れて、次第に燈火のようにうすれてしまった。不思議に思いそばへ寄ると、一匹の黒白の狐が、矢を口にふくんで、何かを語るような様子であった。昌則は五体のしびれを感じ、「ああもったいない、臥牛山の主だったのですか、そうとは知らず矢を射ったことをお許しください。」と弓を投げ捨てて大地にひれ伏して礼拝すると、不思議なことに、目の前にいた黒白の狐の姿が消えてしまった。これはきっと臥牛山の主だったのだと考え、頂上に登ってみると東のすみに一個の石室があった。よく見ると先ほど放った矢と稲荷大明神の立像だったので、一層確信を深め罪の中で殺生より重いものはないということを理解し、このことを縁に今後は決して殺生はしまいと神前に誓い、その場に弓矢を投げ捨てて礼拝し、月の光を頼りに自分の里に帰った。そして悟りを得て、名を観空由公と改めた。後に、ふと初心の事を思い出し、ゆかりの地である臥牛山の麓の虎藪に一堂を建てて薬師如来を安置した。里人たちはこれを聞き、殊勝なことと食べものなどを与えたので、昌則は喜び念仏三昧に入り、九十二才でこの世を去った。この夜、不思議なことに臥牛山に狐火が現れ、全山を包むがごとき奇観を呈したということである。

黒白の狐
山の主はなぜ狐なのか？臥牛山を舞台にするのであれば、狐ではなく山の名を冠している牛の方が適当だと思える。だが牛とは縁もゆかりもない狐が山の主になっているのには理由がある。元来、狐というのは稲作の神稲荷として祀られてきた。その稲荷に化かされ狩猟を生業としてきた猟師が人生を悔い改め仏道に入るというのは、「狩猟民の農耕民化」を表していると考えられる。こういった事柄を隠喩的表現で表すために山の主を狐にしているのだと思われる。

類似縁記
「大山縁記」「立山開山縁記」「熊野権現垂迹縁記」「四国徧霊場記」「継鹿尾山縁記」「間々観音縁記」などがある。林昌寺縁記は春日井市内の伝説の中でも珍しく内容が似ている伝説が各地に存在している。各地の縁記を比較すると林昌寺縁記は全ての要素がそろっている典型例である。また、著名社寺縁記と遜色がないことからおそらく林昌寺の僧が著名社寺縁記に通じていたと考えられる。

The motif was present in a wide array of media, including newspaper reports, songs, sheet music, and visual art. There is an urban legend claiming that black children or infants were in fact used as bait to lure alligators, although there is no meaningful evidence that children of any race were ever used for this purpose. In American slang, alligator bait is a racial slur for African-Americans.

Popular culture
In the American popular imagination, black children were commonly used as bait for hunting alligators, which  are one of the central apex predators of the folklore of the United States, along with cougars, bears and wolves. The reasons for dubbing black babies ""alligator bait"" are unknown, but the identification may be a consequence of earlier associations of African crocodiles—a relative of American alligators—with Africa and its people. Gators largely live in the swamplands of the Southern United States, which were one place people escaping enslavement hid to evade capture. According to popular legend, enslaved people who disappeared in swamps may have been killed by alligators; children were understood as particularly vulnerable to attacks by alligators, and that identification may have evolved into the bait image. Alligator lore draws from ""a shared dread of these reptilian creatures that come out of the water to eat dogs and children.""
The alligator bait image is a subtype of the racist pickaninny caricature and stereotype of black children, where they were represented as almost unhuman, filthy, unlovable, unkempt, ""unsupervised and dispensible."" In 19th and 20th century American popular media, stereotyped depictions of black children were common:

[Black children in popular media had] wide toothy grins, rolling white eyes, shiny dark faces, and uncontrollably kinky hair...Supportive props [included] watermelon, bales of cotton, and alligators...The more vicious scenes devalued black children's lives to the extent that entrepreneurs claimed they were 'dainty morsel,' 'free lunches' or 'gator bait' for carnivorous reptiles. 
Drawings of black babies luring alligators were printed by companies like Underwood & Underwood on postcards, cigar boxes, and sheet music covers, The trope also appeared in films and in paintings. The sheet music drawings were almost purely symbolic; the images of black children being hunted by alligators were not represented in almost any corresponding music, though other songs (without the iconography) did have alligator bait as a component. In general, the drawings reinforced the racist belief that black people were victims to nature, and that their race made it reasonable to assume they should die terribly. Alligator-bait-themed postcards and greeting cards were part of a larger genre of anti-black racist ephemera known as coon cards. American Mutoscope and Biograph Company produced a pair of short films in 1900 called The 'Gator and the Pickaninny and Alligator Bait. In the former, ""a black man with an ax unhesitatingly attacks an alligator that has swallowed a small black boy; as a result, the boy, Jonah-like, is restored."" In the latter, according to the film-company catalog, ""A little colored baby is tied to a post on a tropical shore. A huge 'gator comes out of the water, and is about to devour the little pickaninny, when a hunter appears and shoots the reptile."" Due to the popularity of the idea, letter openers were manufactured in designs resembling alligators, some of which came equipped with small replicas of black children's heads to be placed in the alligator's mouth.

The title ""Alligator Bait"" for an 1897 collage of nine African-American babies posed ""on a sandy bayou"" was supposedly suggested by a hardware-store employee in Knoxville, Tennessee as part of a naming contest with a cash prize. By 1900, the photo had sold 11,000 copies and brought in US$5,000 (equivalent to about $188,980 in 2024) for McCrary & Branson. In 1964, a New Jersey editorial writer recalled a copy of the photo—meant to ""elicit an amused appreciation""—that had once hung in a local shop. The newspaper editor described the image as ""immoral"" and equivalent to ""viciously pornographic pictures."" American studies professor Jay Mechling concludes his essay (about how alligators are used in cultural messaging) on a similar note:

To discover the ways in which these symbols and stories carry anti-female and anti-black meanings is to see the ideology packed into our most taken-for-granted attitudes toward the world. Thinking anew about the symbolic alligator becomes a moral act, perhaps a moral duty, as we resist the power of the 'myths that think themselves in our minds.'

Adult black men were presented in a  similar manner as the babies: A 2003 Museum of Florida History exhibit called The Art of Hatred: Images of Intolerance in Florida Culture included postcards that ""depict black people getting eaten by alligators as a joke. 'Free lunch in the Everglades, Florida' reads one."" Such postcards were common well into the 1950s. The image of black children being put in peril to lure alligators remains present in popular culture in the 21st century.
In her 1994 book Ceramic Uncles & Celluloid Mammies: Black Images and Their Influence on Culture, Patricia Turner, an African American studies professor who has researched the alligator bait cultural phenomenon, notes that stories of ""alligator bait"" are invariably narrated by whites, sometimes grouping ""Negroes and dogs"" together as similarly overawed with fear of alligators. There are no equivalent stories in 19th and 20th century black folklore collections.
Turner argues that the repetitive, insistent ""alligator bait"" iconography of partially clothed young children placed in danger of predation by large reptiles is not so much a stereotype or an urban legend as wishcasting: ""They implicitly advocate...aggression in eliminating an unwanted people...the alligator is an accomplice in an effort to eradicate, or at least intimidate, the black.""  Mechling is more sexually explicit, arguing that white storytellers use the culturally constructed idea of ""alligator-ness"" in these images and stories to symbolically emasculate African American and Native American men alike. Claudia Slate, a professor of English at Florida Southern College, makes an analogy to the terroristic practice of lynching in the United States and argues ""Containment of African Americans was a top priority for southern whites, and instilling fear, whether by actual ropes or imagined reptile attacks, served this purpose.""

Historicity debate
The idea that anyone was intentionally using children for alligator hunting was debunked in print as early as 1918; a Florida guidebook reassured potential tourists that ""upon reliable authority [an alligator] will not attack a human, regardless of the fiction that pickaninnies are good alligator bait."" In 1919 a Port St. Lucie newspaper column complained, ""Many years ago this serious error was perpetrated on Florida by an advertising agent of a railroad running through the South...Florida's portion was [advertised with] pictures of moss hung swamps, rattlesnakes, alligators, and negro babies labelled 'alligator bait'... this harmful psychology became very popular..doubtless many foreigners believing that these babies were actually used for alligator bait."" In 1926 a columnist for The Eustis Lake Region called it ""a piece of Florida fiction going the rounds which ancient spinsters in snowbound lands delighted to repeat as truth. It gave them a feeling of virtuous superiority over the denizens of the pleasant land of Florida.""
In May 2013, Franklin Hughes of the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia at Ferris State University in Michigan argued that due to the number of periodicals which mention the use of black children as bait for alligators, it likely occurred, though it was not widespread or became a normal practice. Hughes essentially argues that since there was no discernible limit to the dehumanization and degradation of African Americans in the U.S. national history, feeding children to animals for sport cannot be precluded as a possible reality. Four years later, Hughes argued again that it likely occurred, though he also found an article from Time magazine, contemporaneous to one alleged incident printed in newspapers, which denied that the practice ever occurred and that the report was a ""silly lie, false and absurd"". 
In the 19th and early 20th century several stories were printed in American newspapers about the alleged practice. Academics have not assessed the authorship and likely veracity of these scattered news items, but a Snopes article from 2017 was unable to find any meaningful evidence that the practice occurred; Patricia Turner told Snopes it likely never did. The Snopes writer said it was impossible to prove a negative claim, and that no proponents of the historicity of the practice have met their burden of proof by providing any evidence of the practice, although the trope of black children being the favorite food of alligators was already widespread in the antebellum United States. Jay Mechling's study of the American folklore of the alligator notes that ""A common folk idea among whites is that alligators have a preference for blacks as a food source."" For example, a 1850 article in Fraser's Magazine reported that alligators ""prefer the flesh of a negro to any other delicacy"". Per Mechling, the earliest instance of this lore is in a 1565 slave trader's account, and as late as the mid-20th century, in a story by Florida writer Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, a gator forgoes a group of naked white guys for the opportunity to gorge itself on an individual black man instead.

Linguistic use
In American slang, alligator bait (or 'gator bait) is a chiefly Southern slur aimed at black people, particularly children; the term implies that the target is worthless and expendable. A variant use, albeit also expressing distaste, was alligator bait as World War II-era U.S. military slang for prepared meals featuring chopped liver. The use of alligator bait to mean poor food (poor in senses of both flavor and socioeconomic class) had fallen out of use in the military by 1954.
The derogatory use of alligator bait is likely pre-Civil War in origin. In 1905 a Vienna, Georgia paper reported high cotton prices and wrote ""The bench-legged pickaninny, once so attractive as alligator bait, is now tenderly nurtured and gets three 'squares' a day, for on him hangs the future hopes of big crops."" In 1905 a postcard with no alligator imagery but picture of a crying black baby was sent to one Delia with the message ""this is great alligator bait."" In 1923 the Moline, Illinois sports page reported ""The Plows used a wee hunk of alligator bait as bat boy yesterday, but the luck turned the other way. At any rate it must be admitted that the little fellow's presence added color."" University of Florida fans were using the ""uncomplimentary phrase"" against Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets players in 1939. 
Alligator bait appears in the lyrics of a 1940s swing-era jazz song called ""Ugly Chile"" (originally published 1917 as ""Pretty Doll"" by Clarence Williams). The song, which ends with a joke shared between performer and audience, is described as an ""exorcism of an unacceptable fact"" that is ""funny and cogent in even the most unprivileged of readings. The version recorded by George Brunies goes: 

In 1968 Major League Baseball pitcher Bob Gibson recalled the slur being used against him while playing in Columbus, Georgia: ""There was a particular fan there who used to ride me. He called me alligator bait. But then I found out just for kicks local folks would tie Negro youngsters to the end of a rope and drag them through swamps, trying to lure the alligators...That's where Negroes stood in Columbus."" The Columbus sports page editor wrote a column castigating Gibson for bringing it up: ""All local citizens, white and Negro, have already recognized [alligator bait] for the myth that it is...I wouldn't be naive enough to deny that there were probably some rough things hurled at Gibson...but swamps and alligators? Really, Bob?"" In 2020, the University of Florida ended the ""Gator Bait"" chant during athletic events; university historian Carl Van Ness said the chant likely started after the 1950s, and though it may not have originated from the racial slur, the two were connected. In the late 1990s African-American UF player Lawrence Wright popularized the phrase ""If you ain't a Gator, you must be Gator Bait.""

Similar tropes
The concept of children luring predators separately existed in colonial Ceylon (today's Sri Lanka). Sri Lankan children were said to have been used as bait for crocodiles, and several newspapers published stories and drawings of the purported practice.

The basic story line has been adapted a number of times in movies.,"The babysitter and the man upstairs—also known as the babysitter or the sitter—is an urban legend that dates back to the 1960s about a teenage babysitter who receives telephone calls that turn out to be coming from inside the house. The basic story line has been adapted a number of times in movies.

Origins
The legend dates as far back as the 1960s, with its exact original inspiration not entirely certain. However, the 1950 unsolved murder of teenage babysitter Janett Christman in Columbia, Missouri, seems to have been an influence, at the very least on later versions via media adaptations.
Days before her 14th birthday, Christman took a babysitting job for a couple, during which she was sexually assaulted and killed by an unknown assailant. One suspect, the 27-year-old Robert Mueller, was an acquaintance of Christman as well as of the couple she was sitting for. (Mueller had employed Christman as a sitter and was playing cards with the couple on the night of the incident; he left early, claiming he needed to take care of a sick child at home but he was determined not to have gone home just then.) Christman called the police with screams for help, but they did not learn her address. When the couple returned, the porch light was on and the front door unlocked, implying Christman had let her attacker in. A side window had been unnecessarily broken out with a garden hoe stowed inside the house.

Legend
The legend details a teenage girl who is watching television at night while babysitting after the children have been put to bed upstairs. The phone rings; the unknown caller tells her to ""check the children"". The girl dismisses the call, but the anonymous caller dials back several times, and the girl becomes increasingly frightened. Eventually, the babysitter calls the police, who inform her they will trace the next call. After the stranger calls again, the police return her call, advising her to leave immediately. She evacuates the home and the police meet her to explain that the calls were coming from inside the house and that the unidentified prowler was calling her after killing the children upstairs.

Other versions
Some variants of the story have one or more of these details:

In more child-friendly versions, the caller turns out to be either one of the children or an elder sibling who decided to scare the babysitter as a prank and they get told off by the police.
The babysitter is also killed.
The babysitter rescues the children and the prowler is arrested by police.
While being taken away by the police, the prowler whispers or says out loud ""See you soon!"" to the babysitter.
In some versions, when the prowler calls the babysitter, he just makes scary noises like giggling or heavy breathing. Also in this version, when the operator says that the calls have been coming from the same house, the phone goes quiet, and when the operator asks if the babysitter is still there, all they get is the same scary noises, meaning that the babysitter has already been killed.
The children are with the babysitter while watching television. The prowler starts phoning them, saying that he'll be with them in a decreasing amount of time. Then after they get the news that the calls are coming from inside the house, they hear a door upstairs opening and then the sound of footsteps heading toward their room. This version can be found in the first book of the Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark books.
Years later, the babysitter is now an adult and has a family of her own. One evening, she and her husband go to have dinner out while a babysitter looks after the children. The evening is going well until a waiter approaches their table and says that there is a phone call for her. She then answers the phone and hears ""Did you check the children?"" This is an ending that appears in some of the movie versions.
The police inform one of the children that they found the prowler under the kid's bed holding a weapon.

The Clown Doll/Statue version/legend
A similar urban legend is The Clown Statue or The Clown Doll. A babysitter is unnerved by what she assumes is a hideous life-sized statue of a clown in the corner of the room. When the mother or father of the children she is caring for calls home to check in, the babysitter asks if she can cover the clown statue with a blanket. The parent informs the babysitter they do not own a clown statue: the ""statue"" was really a murderer with dwarfism that dresses in a clown costume.
Due to the nature of this version, its own variants of the story have one or more of these details:

The children mention the murderous small person stalking them, either early or later in the story.
The murderous small person pretends to be a clown doll, instead of a clown statue.
In some versions, the room itself can be the parent's bedroom or the basement, rather than the living room.
The babysitter gets slowly annoyed by the clown statue sometime later, before calling the parents and getting their permission to cover the clown statue up.
In some versions, the babysitter either asks the parents to switch rooms or she walks up and/or down the stairs as a means to avoid seeing the statue.
The babysitter uses a sheet or something else to cover up the clown statue.
In some versions, the story takes place in Newport Beach, California.
In a few versions, the intruder is a perverted homeless person or a vengeful ghost clown who died in that family's home, instead of a murderous small serial killer or a mentally ill patient.

Millions of dollars worth of gold was lost or unaccounted for after the war, and its possible location has been a source of speculation for many historians and treasure hunters. Allegedly, some of the Confederate treasury was hidden in the hope that the South would rise again, and at other times simply so that the Union would not gain possession of it.

Origin of the legend
When Union troops were on the verge of invading New Orleans, Confederates quickly removed millions of dollars of gold to a ""safer"" location – the city of Columbus, Georgia. The gold was temporarily stored at the Iron Bank by William H. Young. On October 11, 1862, General P. G. T. Beauregard was ordered to take the gold from Young's bank in Columbus. Young refused to release it, but was compelled to do so by force. According to Beauregard's biography, ""What became of that coin is a mystery.""

Halleck's allegations
Amid the collapse of the Confederacy, General Henry Halleck, Chief of Staff of the Union armies, wrote on April 26, 1865, that Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy, was fleeing with large quantities of specie. Halleck stated that Richmond, Virginia bankers estimated specie valued ""from six to thirteen millions"" were traveling south from Goldsboro, North Carolina in wagons. Halleck ordered Generals Wilson and Canby to intercept the rebel leaders and any wealth they were transporting.
Davis did, in effect, take what was left of the stable-value Confederate treasury with him, which consisted of $528,000 (equal to $10,845,809 today) in gold and silver bullion (some of it in Mexican silver coinage), when he and his cabinet fled Richmond on April 3, 1865 by train. However, the treasury increasingly became an encumbrance on his flight, and Davis had disbursed the treasury along the way, among others to General Joseph E. Johnston in order for him to pay his troops at Greensboro, North Carolina, and to several banks for safekeeping, with the remainder paid out to Joseph Wheeler's accompanying cavalry men before dismissing them from their duties. Davis had nothing on him when he was captured in the end on May 10 in Irwinville, Georgia.

Trenholm's embezzlement
George Trenholm, who was Confederate States Secretary of the Treasury for the last year of the Civil War, was arrested after the war and accused of making off with millions in Confederate assets. Trenholm had accompanied Davis on part of his flight but dropped out prematurely due to ill health, which was taken as circumstantial evidence by his Union accusers, when they later accused Trenholm of theft.

In fiction
In the Italian comic book Tex, Confederate gold was placed on board a Confederate river ironclad which ended up in the swamps around the Arkansas River. The gold was later found by members of the Ku Klux Klan who intended to use it to finance a new rebellion in the Southern United States. The ironclad, along with the gold, was destroyed in an explosion by Tex Willer.
In the Franco-Belgian comic book series Blueberry (volumes ""Chihuahua Pearl"" through ""Ballad for a Coffin""), $500,000 in Confederate gold bullion (being the historical end-of-war Confederate treasury as well) was smuggled to Mexico by a group of Confederate soldiers led by Colonel Trevor, the latter acting under orders from Confederate President Jefferson Davis to do so, and who buried the gold in the graveyard of the deserted village of Tacoma, Chihuahua state. The gold was later found by Juaristas who used it to finance their fight against Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico.
A series of western adventure novels written by Paul Wheelahan (using the pseudonym E. Jefferson Clay) featured two brawling Civil War veterans searching for stolen Confederate gold.
In the 1936 novel Gone with the Wind, Rhett Butler is rumored to have stolen the Confederate gold.
In the 1966 spaghetti Western film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, the protagonists get information about lost Confederate gold, worth $200,000, hidden in a grave at a cemetery.

The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum was built in the town where Graves said the game was created, Cooperstown. The legend is well known among fans of the sport.

Background
In the late 19th century and early 20th century, a dispute arose about the origins of baseball and whether it had been invented in the United States or developed as a variation of rounders, a game played in Great Britain and Ireland. The game had found increasing popularity in the U.S. after the rise of professional baseball during the 1860s and 1870s, and immigrants were composing a higher percentage of players, in particular those of Irish descent. The theory that the sport was created in the U.S. was backed by Chicago Cubs president Albert Spalding and National League (NL) president Abraham G. Mills. In 1889, Mills gave a speech during a banquet to honor the Chicago team and a group of NL all-stars, both of which had participated in a world tour to promote the game. During his remarks at Delmonico's restaurant in New York City, Mills declared that baseball was strictly American, which he said was determined through ""patriotism and research""; his audience of about 300 responded by shouting ""No rounders!""
The rounders theory was supported by prominent sportswriter Henry Chadwick, a native of Britain who noted common factors between rounders and baseball in a 1903 article. Like baseball, rounders features nine-player teams, fields with four bases, and clubs alternately batting during a selected number of innings. In contrast to baseball, in which bags are used for bases, rounders games utilize sticks; another key difference between the games is that foul balls do not occur in rounders. Chadwick said in his piece that ""There is no doubt whatever as to base ball having originated from the two-centuries-old English game of rounders."" Spalding disputed Chadwick's article in the next version of his Spalding Base Ball Guide.
In 1905, Spalding called for an investigation into how the sport was invented. Chadwick supported the idea, and later in the year a commission was formed. Spalding instructed the commission to decide between the American game of ""Old Cat"" and rounders as baseball's predecessor. Seven men served on the commission, including Mills. Spalding chose the committee's members, picking men who supported his theory and excluding supporters of the rounders claim, such as Chadwick. The committee sought information on the beginnings of the sport from members of the public, soliciting feedback in publications. It received numerous letters, primarily from former players. Many of the details they provided pertained to early variations of baseball, but evidence supporting Spalding's theory was lacking. On April 1, 1905, the Akron Beacon Journal newspaper published an article by Spalding that asked for details on the beginnings of the game to be sent to Amateur Athletic Union president James Sullivan, who was responsible for compiling information and presenting it to the commission. Spalding called the rounders theory ""pap"" and wrote that he would ""refuse to swallow any more of it without some substantial proof sauce with it.""

Letter by Abner Graves
In response to Spalding's request for information on early baseball in the Beacon Journal, mining engineer Abner Graves of Denver, Colorado, wrote a letter to the editor stating that he had seen Abner Doubleday create a diagram of a baseball field. Doubleday (1819–1893) was a career United States Army officer who attained the rank of major general in the Union Army during the American Civil War.
According to Graves' letter, Doubleday set up the first baseball game in Cooperstown, New York, in approximately 1839. The letter, dated April 3, stated that Doubleday had invented baseball as a modified version of town ball, with four bases on the field and batters who attempted to hit tosses from a pitcher standing in a six-foot ring. According to Graves, the first game had matched players from ""Otesego academy and Green's Select school"". In his letter, Graves claimed that he and Doubleday were both students at Green's school. Graves' description of Doubleday's game indicated that each team had 11 players: the pitcher, a catcher, three infielders by the bases, two further infielders who covered the areas between the bases, and four outfielders. It listed the names of seven players from an early game that Graves claimed to have seen. The April 4 edition of the Beacon Journal included the first story that described Graves' Doubleday claims, with a headline that read, ""Abner Doubleday Invented Base Ball"".
The topic received coverage in the Sporting Life newspaper later in 1905. Spalding wrote a letter to Graves asking for evidence to back up his claim; Graves responded by sending a diagram matching the one he said Doubleday had drawn, along with a letter stating that the original had not been preserved and that most of the players at the time were no longer alive. This correspondence stated that the initial game took place between 1839 and 1841. Although Graves was unable to provide further evidence to back his claims, Spalding supported his version of events. The members of the Mills Commission received the available evidence in October 1907, and Mills wrote a report to Sullivan summarizing the findings on December 30. His report gave Doubleday credit for inventing the game of baseball and said that the sport was American in origin, listing 1839 as the year of its creation. Mills said that he understood why Doubleday would make changes to town ball, reducing the number of players in an effort to decrease the risk of injury. He noted that the number of players per team was higher than the nine in modern baseball, but explained this by indicating that he had taken part in games with 11 players per side. Additionally, Mills wrote that he thought Doubleday might have created the modern defensive putout system, which replaced the town ball method in which fielders could hit baserunners with thrown balls to record outs, even though Graves' testimony did not make this claim.
No one else on the committee sent any material to Sullivan after receiving the documentation; one member, Arthur Pue Gorman, had died. The surviving commission members were sent the letter by Mills, which was signed by each of them. Spalding later used the report's acceptance of the Doubleday myth to claim U.S. origins in his baseball history book, America's National Game. Graves' name did not appear in the book; Spalding said that the Doubleday content had come from ""a circumstantial statement by a reputable gentleman"", quoting Mills, and that he had ""nothing to add to [the commission's] report."" In his book, Spalding expressed delight that an American Army general had been found to be baseball's creator.
A reporter for The Denver Post interviewed Graves for a 1912 article, which contained a version of the Doubleday story that varied from what had been given to the Mills Commission in several respects. Graves placed the year of the first game as 1840, one year later than Mills had reported. In the interview, he said that he had played in the game, as a ""Green College"" student. No university of that name in Cooperstown is known to have been in existence. Graves was possibly referencing Major Duff's Classical and Military Academy, an elementary school whose pupils were nicknamed ""Duff's Greens"", which could have been the source for Graves' previous identification of ""Green's Select"" school. The college claim contradicted a previous letter in which he said he had been at Frog Hollow School, another elementary school, when baseball was created by Doubleday. The reporter did not question Graves' account, which included a statement that the 78-year-old was preparing to play in a local exhibition game. Graves again claimed to have taken part in the first game in a 1916 letter published in The Freeman's Journal.

Creation of the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown
The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum was built in the village that served as the location of Doubleday's alleged first game, Cooperstown. An article in the 1920 edition of the Spalding Baseball Guide supported the idea of a monument to Doubleday in Cooperstown. NL president John Heydler offered his backing for Cooperstown's efforts to purchase the grounds where Doubleday was said to have created baseball. In 1923, the village succeeded in buying the property. A baseball stadium—Doubleday Field—was erected there. Around 1934, a baseball said to be from Graves' family was found and purchased by Stephen Carlton Clark, a powerful figure in Cooperstown who created an exhibit in what became the National Baseball Museum around it. The concept of a baseball museum was supported by new NL president Ford Frick, who suggested that a Hall of Fame be created in connection with it. The Hall was subsequently built in Cooperstown. Clark's purchase came to be known as the ""Doubleday ball"", as the belief arose that it was used by him.
A committee from the New York State Legislature traveled to Cooperstown in 1937, and its subsequent report declared that the town was ""the birthplace of baseball"" and recommended a 100th anniversary celebration in 1939; events that were held included the dedication of the Hall and an all-star game. Prior to the ceremonies, the Doubleday claims were criticized by multiple parties: author Robert Henderson wrote that rounders and baseball were related, and Alexander Cartwright's son Bruce reported that his father had invented the sport. (Some sources have reported that fourteen years later, in 1953, the United States Congress formally recognized Cartwright as the inventor of modern baseball, but no documentation of such a declaration exists in the Congressional Record.) As part of Bruce Cartwright's efforts, the manager of Honolulu's Chamber of Commerce sent Hall promoter Alexander Cleland a letter that questioned Graves' account. In response, Cleland promised that a ""Cartwright Day"" would be included in the anniversary events at Cooperstown, which went ahead as scheduled.
Harold Seymour and Dorothy Seymour Mills wrote, ""Some sports columnists pointed out the discrepancy; others got around it as gracefully as possible."" The United States Postal Service marked the anniversary by releasing a commemorative stamp, which did not feature an image of Doubleday. The Hall's day honoring Cartwright was held in the summer of 1939. By this time, Cartwright was a member of the Hall; in 1938, the Centennial Committee had elected him. The honor came weeks after Clark had investigated Doubleday's role in baseball's origins in response to the Cartwright reports.

Reception
Contemporary reactions
After the release of Mills' report, which was published in the 1908 version of Spalding's Guide, the belief that Doubleday had invented baseball ""gained currency among the general public"" in the U.S., according to author Brian Martin. Textbooks recorded the Civil War veteran's creation of the game, as many Americans accepted the idea that it had originated in their country. By 1909, critiques of the report began to appear in the media. In the May 1909 edition of the magazine Collier's, writer William Henry Irwin offered multiple criticisms. First, he expressed the belief that, prior to both Doubleday's purported invention and the existence of rounders, Britain had a sport with the baseball name. In addition, he noted that Doubleday was in West Point, New York, in 1839. That year, he was a United States Military Academy (USMA) plebe. It is unlikely that Doubleday traveled to Cooperstown in 1839, as first-year cadets such as Doubleday were rarely given leave at the time. Also in 1909, The Sporting News' founder, Alfred Henry Spink, received a letter from sportswriter William M. Rankin, which called the Doubleday claims false, citing United States Department of War and West Point records, and said that the New York Knickerbockers had invented baseball in 1845. The articles did little to change popular sentiment at the time.
More stories critical of the Doubleday claims were published in 1939, the 100th anniversary of the supposed invention in 1839. Sportswriter Frank Menke, who believed that baseball evolved from cricket, authored the book Encyclopedia of Sports, in which he published the report from the Mills Commission and critiqued it. Among other comments, he wrote that a reference had been made to a drawing by Doubleday, which had not been known to exist. Another point he raised regarded a link between Doubleday and Mills. Despite having been around Doubleday during the Civil War and later, Mills mentioned no personal involvement in baseball by Doubleday before Graves' testimony was released. Menke's views were given publicity by New York City newspaper reporter Bob Considine. Later in 1939, Henderson wrote that the sport had been detailed in documents dating back to the mid-1830s. A story in The New York Times called Henderson's work ""a regular bomb on the big baseball program"" that was scheduled for Cooperstown, but suggested that the 1839 origin story had ""been accepted for centennial celebration by common agreement among peace loving citizens."" Skepticism of the Doubleday myth took hold by the middle of the century, though. Clark himself eventually expressed doubt that a single person had created the sport.

Modern analysis
The Doubleday story is widely discredited among modern baseball historians. The recollections of Graves have been criticized because Graves was five years old in 1839, and 71 when he first made the Doubleday claims, leading to the possibility of inaccurate memories. Author William Ryczek notes that Graves did not claim to have attended the first game in his initial letter, but stated that he learned of it having been in Cooperstown. Although Spalding referred to Doubleday and Graves as ""playmates"" in his submission of evidence to the Mills Commission, Doubleday was more than a decade older than Graves, turning 20 in 1839. Ryczek describes Graves as an unreliable witness. One of his other claims, which he made to reporters, was that he was a deliveryman for the Pony Express. Graves said that he had worked for the service in 1852, eight years before it was founded. Late in his life, he shot and killed his wife; he was found insane by a jury and committed to a psychiatric hospital. Graves also expressed anti-English sentiments in a letter to the Mills Commission, writing, ""Just in my present mood I would rather have Uncle Sam declare war on England and clean her up rather than have one of her citizens beat us out of Base Ball.""
Author Brian Martin adds that Graves' account was tweaked by the Mills report in multiple ways. Information on fielders throwing at runners was removed, which Martin considers an attempt to show similarity to the baseball being played at the time. In addition, 1839 was called the year of the game's creation by Mills when 1841 was also a possibility according to Graves, who had written that the invention occurred before or after the 1840 presidential campaign of William Henry Harrison, during the spring months.
Doubleday himself made only one mention of baseball in his letters or diaries before his 1893 death; the only time the sport appears in his papers dates from 1871, when he penned a request for equipment. One obituary of Doubleday noted that he had displayed no real interest in outdoor sports during his life. A theory expressed by historian David Block is that Graves had actually known one of Doubleday's cousins, Abner Demas or John—both Cooperstown residents—and eventually the more famous Abner was whom he remembered. While denying that the Doubleday family factored into baseball's creation, fellow historian Peter Morris noted that it is ""conceivable that Graves's recollections had some slim basis in fact."" Historian John Thorn said that Spalding had a connection to Doubleday: he financially supported the Theosophical Society, a group in which Doubleday served as a chapter vice president.
Author Robert Elias credits the Doubleday myth for contributing to the idea of American exceptionalism. Elias cites Doubleday's history with the U.S. military, as well as the sense that ""having a homegrown sport was important for America's national identity."" Historian David Block wrote that Americans had been eager to accept the Doubleday story when it came out, at a time when the U.S. was growing in influence. While calling the Doubleday legend ""amusingly fraudulent"", Alexander Cartwright biographer Harold Peterson said that it had ""obstinate durability.""

Legacy
Long after the Doubleday myth was declared false by historians, it remains an object of fascination. Tim Arango of The New York Times wrote that the story ""has taken a position in the pantheon of great American myths, alongside George Washington's cherry tree, Paul Bunyan and Johnny Appleseed."" It was written about in numerous publications, and became well known among baseball fans. Thorn described Doubleday as ""the man who did not invent baseball but instead was invented by it."" The myth has received the backing of Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig, who said in 2010 that ""I really believe that Abner Doubleday is the 'Father of Baseball.'"" At one time, the state of New York made similar statements in promotions for Cooperstown.
While Chadwick biographer Andrew Schiff noted that ""there is no clear inventor of the game"", further research has been done on the origins of baseball. In 2004, a document was found that dated a sport called baseball to at least 1791, almost 50 years before Doubleday's supposed invention. It was an ordinance from Pittsfield, Massachusetts, which banned baseball from being played within 80 yards of a meeting house in the city; this implies that the game already existed at the time. The theory that activities such as rounders led to modern baseball remains common among modern historians, and older bat-and-ball games have been cited as well.

An extension of the legend developed later involving the growth of baseball in Mexico. Doubleday, who was in the country as part of the Mexican–American War, was alleged to have organized games for military camps, which drew interest from Mexican spectators.
In 1996, the Auburn Astros Minor League Baseball franchise changed its name to the Auburn Doubledays to honor the purported inventor of baseball. A motel in Cooperstown is also named after Doubleday, but unlike Cartwright, Doubleday was never inducted into the Hall. Nonetheless, the Hall supported the Doubleday myth for many years. More recently, the Hall has taken a small step away from the myth; when it announced special events in conjunction with its 75th year of operation in 2013–14, it made the following statement in its official press release:

On June 12, 1939, the National Baseball Museum opened its doors for the first time, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the mythical ""first game"" that allegedly was played in Cooperstown on June 12, 1839.
The Hall states that Cooperstown is ""representative"" of the location of baseball's birthplace, although Doubleday Field has a plaque and sign that repeat the myth's claims. In the Hall's museum, the Doubleday ball's modern display rejects the Doubleday myth, with writings that call it ""a thriving legend that reflects Americans' desire to make the game our own.""

A common Gullah etiology given for this belief is the 1803 mass suicide at Igbo Landing as a form of resistance among newly enslaved people, although versions of the legend also occur across the African diaspora.

Folklore
In a Gullah context, the flying Africans are associated with Hoodoo spirituality, and sometimes perform their ascension through a ritual like a ring shout. Gullah lore also associates flying Africans with a magical iron hoe that works by itself, and a never-empty pot that they leave behind, perhaps relating to the influence of the Yoruba deity Ogun on Hoodoo. Another figure described in Gullah lore as flying on occasion and eventually returning to Africa is the folk hero John the Conqueror.

Sometimes flight is mentioned as a general ability of select ancestors, outside of the specific context of an African return. Flight could be by an individual, by a married couple (who might have to leave behind their children if not African-born), or as a collective act. In some Caribbean versions, salt prevents people from flying, perhaps linked to the soucouyant tradition. The means of flight varied, from levitation, to growing wings, to turning into birds (sometimes buzzards), or in the case of the Igbo Landing drownings, they were allegorized as walking on water to Africa.
The legend has been compared to the flying imagery found in a number of spirituals, and also to the metaphor of a ""caged bird"". Spirituals in this vein include ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"", ""Now Let Me Fly"" and ""All God's Chillun Got Wings"". Harriet Tubman experienced dreams of flying ""like a bird"" in her youth.

Legacy
The legend appears a number of times in interviews for the Federal Writers' Project Slave Narrative Collection of the 1930s, though given the circumstances these are difficult to interpret; it appears in somewhat greater cultural detail in the slightly later Drums and Shadows. Zora Neale Hurston includes a Jamaican version in her 1938 Tell My Horse, where those who have consumed salt are unable to fly away. John Bennett in 1946 published a story under the title of the spiritual ""All God's Chillun Got Wings"" as told to him by Caesar Grant. It appears in The Book of Negro Folklore of 1958, edited by Langston Hughes and Arna Bontemps.
Ralph Ellison's short story Flying Home was written in 1967. It is mentioned in Ishamel Reed's 1976 Flight to Canada. Toni Morrison's 1977 novel Song of Solomon references the legend directly, and it is also alluded to in much of her other  writing. In interviews, Morrison emphasized the flying Africans as a real folk belief, not a mere metaphor. It also appears in Octavia Butler's 1980 Wild Seed, Paule Marshall's 1983 Praisesong for the Widow and Charles R. Johnson's 1990 Middle Passage.
The legend itself is included as the title story of Virginia Hamilton's 1986 collection The People Could Fly: American Black Folktales, and in the 2004 standalone reissue The People Could Fly: The Picture Book, with enhanced illustrations by Leo and Diane Dillon.

Julie Dash's 1991 film Daughters of the Dust quotes from Praisesong for the Widow at Igbo Landing. In Dash's research for the film, she found Igbo Landing had such salience that it was identified by tradition in many local places in the Gullah region. Faith Ringgold utilized elements of the legend in her 1991 illustrated children's book Tar Beach, and in subsequent artworks including the 1996 subway mosaic Flying Home: Harlem Heroes and Heroines at 125th Street station, also inspired by the Lionel Hampton composition ""Flying Home"". Ngozi Onwurah's 1994 film Welcome II the Terrordome references the appearance in Daughters of the Dust. The legend is the basis for the song ""We Could Fly"" on Rhiannon Giddens's 2017 album Freedom Highway. Sophia Nahli Allison began her Dreaming Gave Us Wings self portrait series in 2017, including an experimental documentary in The New Yorker. Hamilton's collection also inspired the naming of the 2021 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition Before Yesterday We Could Fly.

The story is thought to date from at least the mid-1950s, and gained significant attention when it was reprinted in the advice column Dear Abby in 1960. It has since become a morality archetype in popular culture, and has been referenced in various horror films.

Legend
The basic premise involves a young couple cuddling in a car with the radio playing. Suddenly, a news bulletin reports that a serial killer with a hook has just escaped from a nearby institution. For varying reasons, they decide to leave quickly. In the end, once they get back to the woman's house, the killer's hook is either found hanging from the door handle or embedded into the door itself. Different variations include a scraping sound on the car door. Some versions start the same way, but have the couple spotting the killer, warning others, and then narrowly escaping with the killer holding onto the car's roof. In another version, the woman sees a shadowy figure watching the couple from nearby. The man leaves to confront the figure, who then suddenly disappears. Thinking that his date just imagined it, the man returns to the car only to see that the woman has been brutally murdered with a hook.
In an alternate version, the couple drive through an unknown part of the country late at night and stop in the middle of the woods, because either the man has to urinate, or the car breaks down and the man leaves for help. While waiting for him to return, the woman turns on the radio and hears the report of an escaped mental patient. She is then disturbed many times by a thumping on the roof of the car. She eventually exits and sees the escaped patient sitting on the roof, banging the man's severed head on it. Another variation has the woman seeing the man's butchered body suspended upside down from a tree with his fingernails scraping against the roof. In another version of this variation, he's hanging right side up and either his blood is dripping on the roof or his feet are scraping against the roof. In other versions, the man does return to the car only to see his date brutally murdered with a hook embedded in her. Other tales have the woman leaving the car when her date doesn't come back, only to see his mutilated body (either on the car's roof, nailed on a tree, or just a few short steps away). As she starts to panic, she runs into the maniac and is also killed. In another variation of the story, the woman is discovered by police. While being escorted to safety, she is warned not to look behind her. When she does so, she sees the grisly aftermath of the man's murder.
A similar legend recounts that a young couple are heading back from a great date when their car breaks down (either from running out of fuel or a malfunction). The man then decides to head off on foot to find someone to help with the problem while the woman stays behind in the car. She then falls asleep while waiting and wakes up to see a hideous person looking at her through the window. Luckily, the car is locked, so the person can't get inside. But to the woman's horror, the person raises both of his arms to reveal that they are holding her date's severed head in one hand and the car keys in the other. The fate of the woman is never revealed.

Origin
The origins of the Hook legend are not entirely known, though, according to folklorist and historian Jan Harold Brunvand, the story began to circulate some time in the 1950s in the United States. According to Brunvand in The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends and Their Meanings, the story had become widespread amongst American teenagers by 1959, and continued to expand into the 1960s. Snopes writer David Mikkelson has speculated that the legend might have roots in real-life lovers' lane murders, such as the 1946 Texarkana Moonlight Murders.
The first known publication of the story occurred on November 8, 1960, when a reader letter telling the story was reprinted in Dear Abby, a popular advice column:

Dear Abby: If you are interested in teenagers, you will print this story. I don't know whether it's true or not, but it doesn't matter because it served its purpose for me: A fellow and his date pulled into their favorite ""lovers lane"" to listen to the radio and do a little necking. The music was interrupted by an announcer who said there was an escaped convict in the area who had served time for rape and robbery. He was described as having a hook instead of a right hand. The couple become frightened and drove away. When the boy took his girl home, he went around to open the  car door for her. Then he saw—a hook on the door handle! I will never park to make out as long as I live. I hope this does the same for other kids. —Jeanette
Literary scholar Christopher Pittard traces the plot dynamics of the legend to Victorian literature, particularly the 1913 horror novel The Lodger by Marie Adelaide Belloc Lowndes. Though the two narratives have little in common, he notes that both are built upon a ""threefold relationship of crime, dirt, and chance... Such a reading also implies a reconsideration of the historical trajectory of the urban legend, usually read as a product of postmodernist consumer culture.""

Interpretations
Folklorists have interpreted the long history of this legend in many ways. Alan Dundes's Freudian interpretation explains the hook as a phallic symbol and its amputation as a symbolic castration.
Swedish folklorist Bengt af Klintberg describes the story as an example of ""a conflict between representatives of normal people who follow the rules of society and those who are not normal, who deviate and threaten the normal group.""
American folklorist Bill Ellis interpreted the maniac in The Hook as a moral custodian who interrupts the sexual experimentation of the young couple. He sees the Hookman's disability as ""his own lack of sexuality"" and ""the threat of the Hookman is not the normal sex drive of teenagers, but the abnormal drive of some adults to keep them apart.""

In popular culture
A version of the story by author Alvin Schwartz appears in the 1981 collection of short horror stories for children Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.
In film, the Hook legend has occasionally appeared: in the 1947 film Dick Tracy's Dilemma, fictional detective Dick Tracy pursues a murderous killer with a hook for a hand. The killer-with-a-hook theme has also appeared in comedies; in Meatballs (1979), Bill Murray's character tells the Hook legend to campers around a campfire. In Shrek the Halls (2007), Gingy tells an alternate version of this legend to his girlfriend Suzy in his flashback. The story has, however, most often been depicted and referenced in horror films. Its prevalence, according to film scholar Mark Kermode, is most reflected in the slasher film, functioning as a morality archetype on youth sexuality.  He Knows You're Alone (1980) opens with a film within a film scene in which a young couple are attacked by a killer while in a parked car. The slasher film Final Exam opens with a scene in which a couple are attacked in a parked car, and later, a student is murdered in a university locker room with a hook. Campfire Tales (1997), an anthology horror film, opens with a segment retelling the Hook legend, set in the 1950s. I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) features a killer stalking teenagers with a hook; at the beginning of the film, the central characters recount the Hook legend around a campfire. The Candyman films of the 1990s, as well as its 2021 Nia DaCosta update, are centered on this legend as well. Lovers Lane (1999) is a slasher film featuring a killer who murders teenagers at a lovers' lane with a hook. 
The story has also appeared in various television programs; ""The Pest House"" (1998), the fourteenth episode of season 2 of the TV series Millennium, opens with a murder similar to that of the urban legend. Season 1, episode 7 of the TV show Supernatural features a hookman as the villain. It is the first story in the first episode of Mostly True Stories?: Urban Legends Revealed. The Canadian animated anthology series Freaky Stories (1997) has a segment in its first season based on the Hook, set in 1963. The story is referenced in ""The Slumber Party"" episode of Designing Women. The Hookman is used as a plot device in season 3, episode 5 of Community: ""Horror Fiction in Seven Spooky Steps"".
A parody of the Hookman is used in SpongeBob SquarePants, season 2, episode 16: ""Graveyard Shift"", in which Squidward, in an attempt to scare SpongeBob out of his wits while they are working at night, tells a made-up horror story of the ""Hash-Slinging Slasher"" – a dark, faceless figure donning a raincoat who has a rusty, old spatula in place of a hand.
The story received a resurgence in popularity on the internet following a retelling of it on 4chan that became an internet meme, due to it being written in broken English with several humorous errors, most notably its abrupt ending where the entire twist is rendered simply as the phrase ""Man door hand hook car door"", which has since become what this version of the story is referred to as.

Story
The story of Indian Emily varies by rendition but involves a wounded Apache girl who is taken to the hospital in Fort Davis and cared for by a family that called her Emily. Emily fell in love with a young man (Lieutenant Thomas Easton, the son of her savior in the 1919 version; Lieutenant John Essen, her savior himself in later ones) but fled when she learned of his engagement to another woman. She returned to Fort Davis to warn upcoming attack, only to be shot by a sentry as she tried to enter the garrison. Her last words warned of the attack and expressed her love for the man. The next day, the garrison successfully defended itself due to her warning.

History
This story was initially published in Carlyle Raht's  The Romance of Davis Mountains and Big Bend Country in 1919. Ten years later, a slightly different version was published in the Dallas Semi-Weekly News, and then again, for a larger audience in April 1930 in the Frontier Times.

Fort Davis historian and newspaperman Barry Scobee told Raht's version in several newspaper articles and books on Fort Davis, embellishing the story. Scobee added elements of a sentimental slave-master relationship, placing Emily as Mrs. Easton's maid and having her call for Mrs. Easton as she dies. In 1936, Scobee and other residents successfully advocated that the Texas Centennial Commission erect a historical marker on the fort's grounds, at the purported site of her grave. The monument reads ""Here lies Indian Emily, an Apache girl, whose love for a young officer induced her to give warning of an Indian attack. Mistaken for an enemy, she was shot by a sentry, but saved the garrison from massacre.""
In 1955, Scobee admitted in a letter that he knew the U.S. army had no record of Lieutenant Tom Easton, but ""for the most part kept mum about it, so as not to wreck a good story"". In 1960, Scobee admitted that there was little evidence to support the story, adding that there was little evidence that the Apache ever attacked the fort.

The story was repeated in an episode of Death Valley Days, with an episode dedicated to the story of Indian Emily, played by Jolene Brand. Meg Wyllie and Burt Metcalfe played Mrs. Easton and Tom.
A 1968 article in Big West Magazine claimed that Indian Emily persisted as a ghost, screaming for Tom to return to her.
J. T. Rutherford attended Fort Davis's centennial celebration and told the story on the Congress floor. When he later brokered a deal to establish national parks on the east and west coasts, he added Fort Davis as a National Historic Site, the story of Indian Emily helping to establish the decision.
When Fort Davis became a part of the National Park Service, researchers unsuccessfully searched for historical evidence of Indian Emily. In 1960, some researchers dug at the historical marker where Indian Emily was said to be buried, to find an empty gravesite.

Historic Basis
Scobee claimed that the story would have been set at the height of Apache activity in the area, around 1880. William Hall contradicted this claim, saying it would have happened shortly after the post was established in 1867. Fred Atkinson, who wrote about the story in the Big West magazine in 1968, set the story with the  Third U. S. Cavalry in Fort Davis from 1885 to 1887, between 1890 and 1891.
The National Park Service cites two specific instances that might have inspired the Indian Emily story. In September 1868, North Cavalry troops returned to Fort Davis from a skirmish with Indians about a hundred miles away with a female Indian child and two Mexican boys who had been held captive. Another possibility references an 1881 incident in which Texas Rangers captured a wounded Indian woman and two children near Van Horn, Texas and brought them to Fort Davis. On January 9, 1882, post-surgeon Paul R. Brown recorded the ""cowardly and brutal murder"" of the woman, whose head had been split with an axe, with ""rape seem[ing] to have been the object"".
Historians also note that when the post cemetery was moved upon Fort Davis's 1891 deactivation, one grave was not that of an ""Indian Squaw"".
Historian Bruce Lamberson found that there was never an army officer of any rank named Easton before 1900. While some civilian Mr. Easton/Easdons were in Fort Davis, he also could not find a Miss Nelson, Lieutenant Easton's purported fiancée.

History
Some time in the mid 19th century one member of the Ray family had contracted tuberculosis, and the first fatality came with the death of 24-year-old Lemuel Ray in 1845. Shortly after Lemuel Ray's father Henry B. Ray died in 1851. Two years later 26-year-old Elisha Ray, Lemuel's brother, died in 1853. One year after that in 1854 Henry Ray, Henry B. Ray's eldest son and Lemuel and Elisha's brother, died from the disease.  Another common method to ensure that dead family members remained that way was to cut out the heart of the deceased member and burn it to cure the rest of the family and put the spirit to rest.
The Ray family died of tuberculosis (then known as consumption) over a period of nine years.

Modern rediscovery
A few miles away from where the Ray family is buried, in the early 1990s a few children were playing near a hillside gravel mine in Griswold, Connecticut. There, they discovered the unmarked Walton Family graveyard. 29 graves were uncovered collectively belonging to both the Walton family and the Barber Family. One such grave had a body which was buried, exhumed, then reburied with its skull dislocated from its spine placed face down with its femurs placed in an ""X"" below the skull.

Other Lost Dutchman's mines
Robert Blair wrote ""[t]here have been at least four legendary Lost Dutchman's gold mines in the American West, including the famed Superstition mine of Jacob Waltz"". One Lost Dutchman's mine is said to be in Colorado, another in California; two are said to be located in Arizona. Tales of these other Lost Dutchman's mines can be traced to at least the 1870s. The earliest Lost Dutchman's mine in Arizona was said to have been near Wickenburg, about 180 km (110 mi) north-west of the Superstition Mountains: a ""Dutchman"" was allegedly discovered dead in the desert near Wickenburg in the 1870s alongside saddlebags filled with gold. Blair suggested that ""fragments of this legend have perhaps become attached to the mythical mine of Jacob Waltz"".

Stories about the mine
Granger wrote that ""fact and fiction blend in the tales"", but that there are three main elements to the story:

""They are, first, tales of the lost Apache gold or Dr. Thorne's mine; second, tales about the Lost Dutchman's; and, third, stories of the soldiers' lost gold vein ... [t]he most complete version of the Lost Dutchman's story incorporates all three legends"". Blair argued that there are kernels of truth at the heart of each of these three main stories, though the popular story is often badly garbled from the actual account. Other theories have materialized that speculate the mine is buried at the bottom of Apache or Roosevelt Lake.
In 1977, Granger identified 62 variants of the Lost Dutchman's story – some of the variations are minor, but others are substantial, casting the story in a very different light from the other versions.

Lost Apache gold or Dr. Thorne's story
In this story (actually two interconnected stories), members of the Apache tribe are said to have a very rich gold mine located in the Superstition Mountains. Famed Apache Geronimo is sometimes mentioned in relation to this story. In most variants of the story, the family of a man called Miguel Peralta discovered the mine and began mining the gold there, only to be attacked or massacred by Apaches in about 1850 in the supposed Peralta massacre. Years later, a man called Dr. Thorne treats an ailing or wounded Apache (often alleged to be a chieftain) and is rewarded with a trip to a rich gold mine. He is blindfolded and taken there by a circuitous route, and is allowed to take as much gold ore as he can carry before again being escorted blindfolded from the site by the Apaches. Thorne is said to be either unwilling or unable to relocate the mine.

The truth about the Peralta Mine
Most likely because Pedro de Peralta had been the Spanish Governor of New Mexico (in the 1600s) his family name of ""Peralta"" was the inspiration for a number of legends in the American Southwest. James Reavis tried to assert that the Peralta family had a Spanish land grant and a barony granted by the King of Spain, which included a huge swath of Arizona and New Mexico, including the Superstition Mountains. The Peralta Massacre is a legend that Apaches supposedly ambushed a mining expedition the Peralta family sent into the mountains. Some carved stones in the area are referred to as ""Peralta Stones"" and Spanish text and crude maps on them are considered by some to be clues to the location of a Peralta family gold mine in the Superstition Mountains, although others believe the stones to be modern fakes. A lack of historical records leaves uncertainty as to whether a Peralta family ever had possession of land, or mines, in or near the Superstition Mountains.
Blair insisted that the Peralta portion of the story is unreliable, writing: ""The operation of a gold mine in the Superstitions by a Peralta family is a contrivance of 20th century writers"". A man named Miguel Peralta and his family did operate a successful mine in the 1860s – but near Valencia, California, not in Arizona. The mine was quite profitable, earning about $35,000 in less than one year; Blair described this as ""an unusually good return"" for such a small gold mine to earn in such a relatively brief period. As of 1975, ruins of the Peralta mine were standing.
However, the Peralta Mine eventually became unprofitable and after the money was gone Miguel Peralta turned to fraud. Dr. George M. Willing Jr. paid Peralta $20,000 for the mining rights for an enormous swath of land – about 3,000,000 acres (12,000 km2) in southern Arizona and New Mexico – based on a deed originally granted by the Spanish Empire in the 18th century. Trouble came after Willing learned that the deed was entirely bogus. Despite his efforts, Willing was never able to recover the money he gave to Peralta. This land grant was the basis of the James Reavis Arizona land swindle (Reavis became Willing's partner and continued to try to prove the authenticity of the land grant for years after Willing's death).
Blair argued that this Peralta story (well known to Arizona residents) was eventually incorporated in the Lost Dutchman's story, in a severely distorted version, following the renewed interest in the Lost Dutchman's mine in the 1930s.
Since James Reavis, ""the Baron of Arizona"", was convicted of fraud when the Peralta family genealogy and other documents to support the land grant (and a barony associated with that land) were determined to be forgeries it also raises questions about the original purchase of the land grant by Dr. George M. Willing Jr. (the transaction had supposedly occurred at a primitive campsite to the southeast of Prescott without the benefit of the typical documentation; instead of a notarized deed, the conveyance was recorded on a piece of greasy camp paper bearing signature of several witnesses). Willing died in 1874 before there had been a thorough investigation of the documents or opportunity to cross examine him on the stand as was later done with Reavis.

The truth about Dr. Thorne
Another detail which casts doubt on the story is the fact that, according to Blair, there was never any Dr. Thorne in the employ of the Army or indeed of the Federal Government in the 1860s. According to Blair, the origin of this story can be traced to a doctor named Thorne who was in private practice in New Mexico in the 1860s. Thorne claimed that he was taken captive by Navajos in 1854, and that during his captivity he had discovered a rich gold vein. Thorne related his claims to three U.S. soldiers in about 1858. The three soldiers set out to find the gold, but without success. Over the decades, this tale was gradually absorbed into the Lost Dutchman's story.

The Lost Dutchman's story
This tale involves two German men, Jacob Waltz and Jacob Weiser. However, Blair argued that there is a strong likelihood that there never was a second man named Weiser, but rather that a single person named Waltz was, over the years, turned into two men as the legend of the Dutchman's mine evolved. Blair contended that this story can be divided into ""hawk"" and ""dove"" versions, depending on whether the German(s) are said to behave violently or peacefully. In most versions of the tale, Jacob Waltz locates a rich gold mine in the Superstition Mountains (in many versions of the story, they rescue or help a member of the Peralta family and are rewarded by being told the location of the mine). Waltz is attacked and wounded by marauding Apaches, but survives at least long enough to tell a man called Dr. Walker about the mine. Waltz is also said to make a deathbed confession to Julia Thomas, and draws or describes a crude map to the gold mine.
John D. Wilburn in his book Dutchman's Lost Ledge of Gold (1990), wrote that the Bulldog Gold Mine near Goldfield, Arizona, fits very well the description Jacob Waltz gave as the location of his 'lost mine'. Furthermore, Wilburn stated that geology indicates that there is no gold in the Superstition Mountains, which are igneous in origin. (However, in some versions, the 'mine' is actually a cache put there by the Peraltas.)

Stories of the soldiers' lost gold vein
In yet another version of the tale, two (or more) U.S. Army soldiers are said to have discovered a vein of almost pure gold in or near the Superstition Mountains. The soldiers are alleged to have presented some of the gold, but to have been killed or to have vanished soon after.
This account is usually dated to about 1870. According to Blair, the story may have its roots in the efforts of three U.S. soldiers to locate gold in an area of New Mexico, based on an allegedly true story related to them by Dr. Thorne of New Mexico; see above.

The historical Jacob Waltz
Blair cited evidence of the historical Jacob Waltz and suggested that additional evidence supports the core elements of the story – that Waltz claimed to have discovered (or at least heard the story of) a rich gold vein or cache. But Blair suggested that this core story was distorted in subsequent retellings, comparing the many variants of the Lost Dutchman's story to the game of Chinese whispers, where the original account is distorted in multiple retellings of the tale.
There was indeed a Jacob Waltz who emigrated to the U.S. from Germany. The earliest documentation of him in the U.S. is an 1848 affidavit in which Waltz declared himself to be ""about 38 years old"". A man called Jacob Walz was born in September 1810 in Württemberg. Blair suggested that this Waltz could be the same Waltz who later came to be regarded as the legendary Dutchman, and that he Americanized the spelling of his family name. Note that tombstone pictured shows birth year as 1808.
Waltz relocated to Arizona in the 1860s, and stayed in the territory for most of the rest of his life. He pursued mining and prospecting, but seems to have had little luck with either. An alternate view which better fits the lost mine legend is that he periodically appeared with large amounts of gold, The Sterling Legend by Estee Conatser reports that a Jacob Walzer sold $250,000 in gold to the U.S. Mint during the 1880s and had $1500 when he died in 1891. In 1870, Waltz had a homestead of about 160 acres (0.65 km2) near Phoenix where he operated a farm. There is a theory that although Waltz never worked at the Henry Wickenburg's Vulture mine, (which was notorious for being poorly-managed)  he could indeed have been a ""fence"" for those who did work at the Vulture.
There was a catastrophic flood in Phoenix in 1891, and Waltz's farm was one of many that was devastated. Afterwards, Waltz fell ill (he was rumored to have contracted pneumonia during the flooding). He died on October 25, 1891, after having been nursed by an acquaintance named Julia Thomas (she was usually described as a quadroon). Waltz was buried in Phoenix at what is now called the Pioneer and Military Memorial Park.
Blair had little doubt that Waltz related to Thomas the location of an alleged gold mine. As early as September 1, 1892, The Arizona Enterprise was reporting on the efforts of Thomas and several others to locate the lost mine whose location was told to her by Waltz. After this was unsuccessful, Thomas and her partners were reported to be selling maps to the mine for $7 each.

The death of Adolph Ruth
Were it not for the death of amateur explorer and treasure hunter Adolph Ruth, the story of the Lost Dutchman's mine would probably have been little more than a footnote in Arizona history as one of hundreds of ""lost mines"" rumored to be in the American West. Ruth disappeared while searching for the mine in the summer of 1931. His skull – with two holes in it identified as bullet holes – was recovered about six months after he vanished, and the story made national news, thus sparking widespread interest in the Lost Dutchman's mine.
In a story that echoes some of the earlier tales, Ruth's son Erwin C. Ruth was said to have learned of the Peralta mine from a man called Pedro Gonzales (or Gonzalez). According to the story, in about 1912 Erwin C. Ruth gave some legal aid to Gonzales, saving him from almost certain imprisonment. In gratitude, Gonzales told Erwin about the Peralta mine in the Superstition Mountains, and gave him some antique maps of the site (Gonzales claimed to be descended from the Peralta family on his mother's side). Erwin passed the information to his father Adolph, who had a long-standing interest in lost mines and amateur exploration. The elder Ruth had fallen and badly broken several bones while seeking the lost Pegleg mine in California. He had metal pins in his leg, and used a cane to help him walk.
In June 1931, Ruth set out to locate the lost Peralta mine. After traveling to the region, Ruth stayed several days at the ranch of Tex Barkely to outfit his expedition. Barkely repeatedly urged Ruth to abandon his search for the mine, because the terrain of the Superstition Mountains was treacherous even for experienced outdoorsmen, let alone for the 66-year-old Ruth in the heat of the Arizona summer.
However, Ruth ignored Barkely's advice, and set out for a two-week stint in the mountains. Ruth did not return as scheduled, and no trace of him could be found after a brief search. In December, 1931, The Arizona Republic reported on the recent discovery of a human skull in the Superstition Mountains. To determine if the skull was Ruth's, it was examined by Dr. Aleš Hrdlička, a well-respected anthropologist who was given several photos of Ruth, along with Ruth's dental records. As Curt Gentry wrote, ""Dr. Hrdlicka positively identified the skull as that of Adolph Ruth. He further stated, after examining the two holes [in the skull], that it appeared that a shotgun or high-powered rifle had been fired through the head at almost point-blank range, making the small hole when the bullet entered and the large hole when it exited"".
In January 1932, human remains were discovered about three-quarters of a mile (1.21 km) from where the skull had been found. Though the remains had been scattered by scavengers, they were undoubtedly Ruth's. Many of Ruth's personal effects were found at the scene, including a pistol (not missing any shells) and the metal pins used to mend his broken bones. But the map to the Peralta mine was said to be missing.
Tantalizingly, Ruth's checkbook was also recovered, and proved to contain a note written by Ruth wherein he claimed to have discovered the mine and gave detailed directions. Ruth ended his note with the phrase ""Veni, vidi, vici.""
Authorities in Arizona did not convene a criminal inquest regarding Ruth's death. They argued that Ruth had probably succumbed to thirst or heart disease (though, as Gentry wrote, ""[o]ne official went so far as to suggest that [Adolph Ruth] might have committed suicide ... While this theory did not ignore the two holes in the skull, it did fail to explain how Ruth had managed to remove and bury the empty shell, then reload his gun, after shooting himself through the head"".) Blair noted that the conclusion of the Arizona authorities was rejected by many, including Ruth's family, and ""those who held onto the more romantic murdered-for-the-map story"".
Blair wrote that ""the national wire services picked up the story [of Ruth's death] and ran it for more than it was worth"", possibly seeing the mysterious story as a welcome reprieve from the bleak news that was otherwise typical of the Great Depression.

Other searches for the mine
Throughout the 20th century, various expeditions and individuals continued to search the Superstitions for the Lost Dutchman Mine. One of the most professional and serious-minded efforts was led by Oklahoma City private detective Glen Magill, who organized multiple expeditions in the late 1960s and early '70s, and claimed on at least two occasions to have identified the location of the mine, later to concede he was either mistaken or the locations were ""played out,"" or bereft of gold. Magill's adventures were chronicled in the book The Killer Mountains, by Curt Gentry.
One fact against the existence of ""Lost Dutchman Mine"" is that Waltz was a ""placer miner""; while the gold pieces he had were in quartz, the Superstition Mountains are in fact volcanic. Lastly, the alleged mine directions Ruth had were from an 1895 newspaper account.

Other deaths and disappearances
Since Ruth's death, there have been several other deaths or disappearances in the Superstition Mountains. Some searchers for the mine have disappeared in likely wilderness accidents.

January 1933, a Mining electrician named J.A. ""Tex"" Bradford of Globe Arizona went in search of the ""Lost Dutchman Mine""; by October 1933, he had been missing for nine months.
In his 1945 book about the Lost Dutchman's mine, Thunder God's Gold, Barry Storm (pen name of John Griffith Climenson) claimed to have narrowly escaped from a mysterious sniper he dubbed ""Mr. X"". Storm further speculated that Adolph Ruth might have been a victim of the same sniper.
July 3, 1947, James A Cravey, age 62, a retired photographer, was reported missing after he had chartered a helicopter June 19, 1947, to drop him off in the Superstition Mountains, to look for the Lost Dutchman's Mine. Cravey said he would walk out of the mountains on June 28, 1947. His headless remains were reportedly discovered in the Superstition Mountains in the mid-1940s.
On November 9, 1949, copper prospector James Kidd went to work in the Superstition Mountains and never returned. He has never been found.
In February 1951, Oregon physician John Burns was found shot to death in the mountains. About a year later in 1952, Joseph Kelley from Dayton, Ohio, vanished. Two years later, only his skull was found, which contained bullet wounds.
Charles Massey came from nearby Tucson, accompanied by a few friends, with plans to hunt in the mountains. While in the Superstitions, he became separated from the main party and was never seen alive again. On February 24, 1955, his skeleton was found. Massey had been shot directly between the eyes. A brief year later, the body of Martin G. Zywotho of Brooklyn, New York, was discovered with a bullet hole in the head.
On March 21, 1961, the body of Walter J. Mowry of Denver, Colorado, was recovered from its resting place near Weaver's Needle. A coroner's jury ruled that his death was caused by a gunshot wound inflicted by a person or persons unknown. That same year, the fully-clothed skeleton of Charles Bohen, a Salt Lake City man, was also found. Despite that he was buried in a shallow grave of sand with a bullet hole in his back, his death was officially ruled a ""suicide."" In June 1961, Jay Clapp, a peaceful recluse who lived in a cave in the Superstitions, disappeared. Clapp's headless skeleton was found some three years later, but the cause of death is still ""unknown.""
The unidentified skeletal remains of Apache Junction John Doe were found on November 23, 1969. He was found with a gunshot wound to the temple.
On January 28, 1981, Suzanne Rosetti was kidnapped by two men, Jess James Gillies and Michael Logan, and taken to Fish Creek Hill in the Superstition Mountains, where she was pushed off a 40-foot cliff. Despite begging to be allowed to die in peace, her killers climbed down and struck and buried her alive with rocks. Gillies was executed on January 13, 1999, while Logan was sentenced to life in prison.
In 1992, a white male in his late 30s to early 40s was found dead in the Superstition Mountains, slain by two gunshot wounds to the back of the head. His identity remains unknown.
On January 13, 1999, the body of Walt Gassler, a gold prospector who had been searching for (and claimed to have found) the Lost Dutchman, was found by ranch hand, Don Shade. An autopsy showed signs of a heart attack, and in his backpack was gold ore allegedly identical to that found by Jacob Waltz. Due to his ailing health, Walt had previously contacted two other prospectors, one of whom was Bob Corbin, Arizona's Attorney General. A few months later, he'd told Bob's partner and local historian, Tom Kollenborn, that he found the Lost Dutchman mine. He disappeared the next day after being dropped off at a local trailhead by his wife. A month after his death, Tom was contacted by someone falsely claiming to be Walt's son, Roland. The man showed him gold similar to that which allegedly came out of the Dutchman mine, and asked Tom for the map and notes to retrace his father's steps. Tom gave him a manuscript and backpack. Months later, Tom was giving a lecture when he was approached by the ""real"" Roland Gassler, who provided his ID. Additionally, this Roland claimed to never have received the backpack that was found on his father's body, according to the ranch hand and Sheriff's report.
On July 11, 2010, Utah hikers Curtis Merworth (49), Ardean Charles (66) and Malcolm Meeks (41) went missing in the Superstition Mountains looking for the mine. Merworth had become lost in the same area in 2009, requiring a rescue. On July 19, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Department called off the search for the lost men. They presumably died in the summer heat. In January 2011, three sets of remains believed to be those of the lost men were recovered.
On August 12, 2020, local artist Khayman Welch (25) was last seen walking southeast from the parking area at Weaver's Needle Vista Viewpoint near State Route 88 in the Tonto National Forest. That day, he did AC work with his uncle, Brian Welch, and on the way home, the two of them stopped at Weaver's Needle Vista. After telling his uncle he wanted a ""better view of the sunset,"" Khayman walked southeast from the parking lot towards Weaver's Needle. He has not been found.

Lost Dutchman State Park
In 1977, 292 acres (118 ha) abutting the Tonto National Forest were set aside as the Lost Dutchman State Park. The park was expanded to 320 acres (130 ha) in 1983. It is accessible about 40 miles (64.4 km) east of Phoenix via U.S. Highway 60, the Superstition Freeway. Hiking and camping are popular activities. There are several paths that go through the brush and cacti. The short ""Discovery Trail"" is a clear route with several placards giving the natural history of the area.

Discovery of the Lost Dutchman Mine
In 2024, a Popular Mechanics article was published by Dave Howard in the Nov./Dec. issue, detailing a number of searches for the lost caches of the Beale Papers.  In 2023, a Cryptographer named James Simpson decoded the Ciphers of the pamphlet published in 1885, by JB Ward, a Confederate Cartographer.  The Ciphers detailed the movement of a team of 30 miners from Virginia to a location of a series of Gold Mines in Arizona's Tonto Mountains, as well as relaying information about the location of a Sentry of the Knights of the Golden Circle, named Jacob Waltz.  Mentioning his homestead along the Green River Basin, it showed details behind the directions to take through a canyon to find a ""Cave of Millions"", known today as the fabled Lost Dutchman Gold Mine.  
In the Ciphers authored by James Reavis, ringleader of the Peralta Land Grab, a dual-use system was created of the base numbers listed, and with the key using a seres of 111 ascending alphabets, climbing to the number 2906 in the 112th alphabet, the substitution produced a resulting page of plaintext letters, which were found to conceal Old English Box Ciphers.  The first Cipher delivered messages of their order to conceal the location of the mines while James Reavis was under investigation.  With a second set of Box Ciphers interwoven into the page, it showed an outline of a trail with landmarks starting at the base of a dam near a shallow fenn or ford.  At the bottom of the map section was the phrase - For Him That Can Find Jacob Waltz's Mines.  
The trail was marked with a starting point using the older Cursum Perficio map, from the era of Spanish Exploration and the excursions that they had made into the many canyons of the Tonto Mountains.  Taking its course across the Rio Salado near the base of the present-day Stewart Dam, it weaves through a labyrinth of trees, and in between three large mounds into the main sections of the trailhead.  A series of mines were found along the trail on either side, each with a guidestone carved along the trail pointing in the direction of the mines on the walls of the canyon.  The trail continues to an Arastra at about a mile into the route, and following kerns stacked along the side of the trail, climbed into the plateau along a series of steep switchbacks, where a more ornate series of carvings and pictographs would be found along the canyon walls.  A final pillar on the side of the trail in the shape of a man's head and face would be used to locate the entrance to the mine.  The entrance to the Lost Dutchman would sit on the North side of the trail, and appear as the last mine on the trail to the plateau, where a camp was found surrounded by a field of golden colored grass.
Further exploration of the trail, known locally as the Gateway Trail, provided the discovery of another series of vertical mill sites which were buried in.  Seldomly used as the waters released from the dam create an impassible obstacle, the Gateway Trail has a significantly obvious route that follows into the canyon with a left-banking turn at the split in the dry river bed, carrying on for another 1000 yds. until it reaches the Arastra.  With the discovery of the mines was also the discovery that older maps existed from the times of the mid-1800s, and detailed the outlines of landmarks and locations of both placer lodes as well as the relative locations of mine openings.  They all feature the name of the river as the Rio Salado on them, further confirming the locations of the mines, as well as being originally used by the Spanish, dating back to an unrecorded period in the history of the Superstition Mountains.
As the discovery of these specific locations found encrypted in the ciphers of the Beale Papers were confirmed, it revealed that a number of later explorations had been made there to harness their wealth, leading eventually to the deaths of many well-known explorers, like Adolph Ruth, and Frank Fish, who were both familiar with the region and had access to the original maps that were passed along by the Spanish.  This would expose the fact that the mass of mining operations of the Spanish were concentrated in that area, and with some effort, additional mines were found along the adjacent trails, leading to the speculation that they were all part of the original ""Peralta Mines"", as one of the maps was signed by Miguel Peralta.

Since the period following the American Civil War, stories about Spanish treasure galleons buried beneath the desert sands north of the Gulf of California have emerged as popular legends in American folklore.

Stories
The ""Lost Galleon""
The earliest tales of a lost Spanish galleon appeared shortly after the Colorado River flood of 1862. Colonel Albert S. Evans reported seeing such a ship in 1863. In the Los Angeles Daily News of August 1870, the ship was described as a half-buried hulk in a drying alkali marsh or saline lake, west of Dos Palmas, California, and 40 miles north of Yuma, Arizona. It could easily be viewed at a distance of several miles from a mesa that lay between Dos Palmas and Palma Seca, California. The stories have given Palma Seca other names: Soda Springs, Indian Springs, and Bitter Springs, as the area was not well mapped in 1870. Expeditions were sent out in search of her, but the ship had either never existed or had vanished into the sand and mud once again. The Galleon, according to legend, is now under the waters of the modern Salton Sea.
There are those who claim the ship is Thomas Cavendish's Content, filled with pirate plunder; others claim that she is the Iqueue, a ship of Spanish mutineers.

Pearl ship of Juan de Iturbe
This legend may refer to the same ship as the Lost Galleon, but its own story has always placed it in a distinct location, closer to the sand hills west of El Centro, California. Descriptions suggest it is closer to the size of one of Christopher Columbus' small caravels. The pearl ship is rumored to have been seen as recently as the 1970s.
The story goes that in 1615, Spanish explorer Juan de Iturbe embarked on a pearl-harvesting expedition, during which his crew sailed a shallow-drafted caravel up the Gulf of California. A high tidal bore carried him across a strait into Lake Cahuilla, a postulated contemporaneous saltwater basin periodically connected to the gulf which was already in the process of drying up permanently. After exploring the lake for several days, Iturbe found himself unable to sail out again, whereupon he beached his craft and made his way back to the nearest Spanish settlement on foot, leaving behind a fortune in black pearls. Sixteenth-century records from New Spain indicate that the De La Cadena family had a pearl-diving monopoly in Baja California.
Iturbe's alleged ship has been seen and lost several times, and there are several stories about it having been looted. A mule driver traveling with the de Anza expeditions through Alta California was said to have removed the pearls in 1774. In 1907, a farmhand named Elmer Carver noticed odd-shaped fence posts while working on Niles Jacobsen's farm in Imperial, California. Mrs. Jacobsen claimed a wind storm had revealed the remains of a ship, which the Jacobsens had repurposed into a fence. Mr. Jacobsen had also found gems which he sold in Los Angeles.

The Viking ship, or the ""Serpent-Necked Canoe""
The Viking stories originated around 1900 from the Mexicans and Indians who live in the Colorado River delta region near the Laguna Salada basin. The ship is consistently described as an open boat with round metal shields on its sides in the badlands west of Mexicali, Mexico.
Around 1933, Myrtle Botts, a librarian from Julian, California, had an encounter with an old prospector who reported seeing a ship lodged in the rock of Canebrake Canyon. He described the vessel as a Viking ship made of wood with a serpentine figure carved in its prow. He gave her and her husband directions to the location but an earthquake prevented the Botts from following the prospector's trail to the ship. Julian's Pioneer Museum, which inherited Myrtle Botts' papers, also inherited those directions.
The Julian Pioneer Museum is not in possession of any records regarding the Viking ship mentioned in this story.
According to The Last of Seris (Dane Coolidge, 1939), the indigenous people of Tiburón Island reportedly encountered whalers visiting from far away, possibly a reference to Norsemen visiting the west coast of Mexico prior to the Spanish.

Ferry boat or river schooner
This story grew out of an effort to explain or debunk the Lost Galleon story. It is thought that an abandoned ferry or steamboat that had broken away during a Colorado River flood and had been left dry in the vast sands of the river delta is the origin of the rumors. Others claim that it was a schooner that gold-seekers wishing to search the more inaccessible portions of the Colorado River had built in Los Angeles and hauled through the desert by a mule or oxen team until the animals perished, leaving the boat mired in soft sand.
The ferry boat story changed over time more often than the Lost Galleon story. One incarnation said that a small ferry (a two-man sweep) was built away from the river in a place a hundred feet or so above sea level, where a source of wood was found, and that a team of six (or more) oxen perished hauling it through the sand near Los Algodones.

Evaluation of the legends
From a smattering of first-, second- and third-hand accounts, a variety of fictional (especially graphic and cinematic) variations of the Lost Ship stories have been created. Not surprisingly, the first-hand accounts are extremely rare. Many of the above references fit the Lost Mines and Urban Legends molds, where the story passes from ear to ear with all evidence disappearing along the way.
Searching for and finding the remains of a Lost Ship is now rather problematic. The greater part of the Salton Sink has been submerged under the Salton Sea since 1905, and much of the adjacent land is under military control and has even been used for bombing ranges, rendering on-the-ground searches highly hazardous and/or illegal.
Lands adjacent to Laguna Salada in Baja California, and between the Gulf of California and the Salton Sea, regularly receive wind-blown sand from the desiccated delta of the much-diverted Colorado River, generating vast sand dune systems. Aerial searches using ground-penetrating radar might reveal ships' remains, but there has not yet been an agency that undertook this project and revealed its findings. Whether or not any such ships actually existed, the legends persist and remain entertaining to many.
Around AD 1500, the lake was 26 times the present size of the Salton Sea.  It has flooded and dried eight times between 1824 and 1905.  In 1540 Spanish explorer Diaz was in the area, and by 1700 to 1750 the lake had infilled.  Presently there is a ""high ground"" in Northern Mexico, of 23 feet, or 6+m.  Thus a ship of 8 foot draft would need to have an additional 30 feet of water, above ""sea level"". While ""king tides"" of summer and winter are the highest, and conceivably a storm surge could add further water building up, wind-blown up the Sea of Cortez, 30 feet of additional depth seems highly unlikely.

Early life, family and death
Ludington was born on April 5, 1761, in Fredericksburg, New York.  She was the first of 12 children of Abigail and Henry Ludington, a gristmill owner. According to his relatives, Sybil's father had fought in the French and Indian War, and volunteered to head the local militia during the Revolutionary War.
At the age of 23, in 1784 Ludington married Edmond Ogden. They had a son named Henry in 1786. In 1792, the family settled in Catskill, and Ogden died in 1799.  In 1811 Ludington moved to Unadilla, New York.
Ludington lived in Unadilla until her death on February 26, 1839, at the age of 77. She was buried near her father in the Patterson Presbyterian Cemetery in Patterson, New York. Her tombstone shows a different spelling of her first name.

Ludington's ride
Accounts that did not emerge until the 20th century, about her alleged 18th century ride, recognize Ludington as a heroine of the American Revolutionary War.

Historical accounts
Accounts originating in the 20th century, from the Ludington family, say Sybil played an important role after the British raid on Danbury, Connecticut.
According to the story printed 140 years after the alleged feat, on April 26, 1777, then 16-year-old Sybil Ludington rode 40 miles (64 km) from her hometown in Fredericksburg, New York (near Danbury, Connecticut) through Putnam County, New York, to rally approximately 400 militiamen under the command of her father, Colonel Henry Ludington, after British forces raided Danbury, where the Continental Army had a supply depot. American troops from New York and Connecticut rallied to engage the British the next day in the Battle of Ridgefield, forcing them to retreat.
A brief mention of Ludington's ride was published by his grandchildren in 1907 as part of Ludington's father's memoirs. Modern accounts say Ludington was congratulated for her heroism by General George Washington; more recent scholarship has raised doubt that the ride even took place.

Research history
A 2022 Smithsonian magazine article written by Abigail Tucker states that the earliest known record of the 1777 account of Ludington's ride came in 1854 from Sybil's nephew, Charles H. Ludington, who sought to have his aunt recognized as a hero. Ludington was included in an 1880 book about the New York City area by local historian Martha Lamb. A brief later reference appeared in the 1907 memoirs written by Willis Fletcher Johnson about Sybil's father and published privately by his grandchildren.
Tucker states that letters written by Ludington herself do not mention the ride. Accounts vary as to whether she rode bareback or sidesaddle, what the name of the horse was, and how her name was spelled (Sybil, Cybal, Sibyl, Sebil, Sybille, or Sibbell).
In 1838, Ludington asked for a pension based on her husband, Ogden, having fought in the Revolutionary War, but she could not prove that she was married to him. According to Paula Hunt, writing in The New England Quarterly journal, ""None of the sworn affidavits attesting to Henry Ogden’s military service and the legitimacy of Sybil's marriage mentioned her ride, nor did she attempt to claim it as justification for a pension.""
Lamb stated that her account relied on sources including letters, sermons, genealogical compilations, wills, and court records to document details. She cites no sources, nor provides documentation of the ride. Hunt suggests the account may have been told to Lamb by Ludington's descendants.

Owing partly to a lack of contemporary accounts, Hunt raises questions about the events. She writes that neither of the original publications about the ride ""had offered any information about Sybil's course"", and the purported route was devised speculatively by the project managers who later installed historic markers, a ""relatively inexpensive but increasingly popular means for states and localities to promote tourism"".  The installation of the historic roadside markers beginning in 1934 – although based on speculative locations according to Hunt – led to publications that propelled Sybil to the status of a heroine by 1937, and the publication of a 1940 poem about her brought the story to a national audience.  Doubts about the story had been raised as early as 1956; contrasting it to the Betsy Ross story, Hunt cites Henry Noble McCracken's, Old Dutchess Forever! The Story of an American County and two New York news articles from 1995, writing that:In Sybil's case, the state-sanctified historical roadside markers, statue, and postage stamp celebrating her ride, and the many books and newspaper and magazine articles that retold her story, had created an aura of authority that effectively dispelled any intermittent bouts of skepticism.
Hunt has provided a history of how the Ludington story has been portrayed in the media and literature, and in efforts to promote tourism. Pollak wrote in 1975 in the New York Times that ""Many children's books treat the account as historical fact"", although the Putnam County Historian indicated there was ""no solid evidence that Sybil actually made the ride"". Hunt states that many popular details were fiction, such as the horse named Star, the stick she held, and the distance of 40 miles. Hunt states that the two accounts of Ludington's ride were not mentioned in any other significant history produced in the same era, and that even as stories of heroic women of the colonial era proliferated by the 1870s, the only published accounts of Ludington were Lamb's and Johnson's. She writes:

Sybil's ride embraces the mythical meanings and values expressed in the country's founding. As an individual, she represents Americans' persistent need to find and create heroes who embody prevalent attitudes and beliefs.
Contemporaneous sources suggest that the Americans, including the residents of Danbury, were already aware of the approaching British forces, as noted in The New-York Gazette and the Weekly Mercury, May 19, 1777, which stated: On Saturday, the 26th of April, express came to Danbury from Brigadier General Silliman, advising that a large body of enemy had landed the day before at sun set, at Compo, a point of land between Fairfield and Norwalk, and were marching toward Danbury. Measures were immediately taken.
In 1996, the national Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) said that the evidence was not strong enough to support their criteria for a war heroine, and added a note to an exhibition saying of the ride, ""It's a great story, but there is no way to know whether or not it is true."" The DAR chapter near her historic home says that her exploit was documented, and it continues to honor her.
Hunt concludes, ""The story of the lone, teenage girl riding for freedom, it seems, is simply too good not to be believed.""

Legacy and honors
In 1934, New York State began to install a number of historic markers along Ludington's purported route.
A commemorative sculpture by Anna Hyatt Huntington was erected at Lake Gleneida near Carmel, New York, in 1961. Smaller versions of the statue are at the Daughters of the American Revolution headquarters in Washington, D.C., the public library in Danbury, Connecticut, and at Brookgreen Gardens, Murrells Inlet, South Carolina.
In 1975, Ludington was honored with a postage stamp in the ""Contributors to the Cause"" United States Bicentennial series. The National Rifle Association of America instituted the Sybil Ludington Women's Freedom Award in 1995.
Composer Ludmila Ulehla wrote the 1993 chamber opera Sybil of the American Revolution based on the story of Ludington's ride. In 2014, Ludington was featured on the American Heroes Channel documentary American Revolution: Patriots Rising. The movie Sybil Ludington: The Female Paul Revere was produced in 2010.

In particular, it is often said there is a secret city beneath its peaks. In some stories, the city is no longer inhabited, while in others, it is inhabited by a technologically advanced society of human beings or mythical creatures.

Klamath legend
According to the local Klamath people, Mount Shasta is inhabited by the spirit chief Skell, who descended from heaven to the mountain's summit. Skell fought with the Spirit of the Below-World, Llao, who resided at Mount Mazama, by throwing hot rocks and lava, probably representing the volcanic eruptions at both mountains. Writer Joaquin Miller recorded various related legends in the 1870s.

Lemuria
Mount Shasta has also been a focus for non-Native American legends, centered on a hidden city (called Telos) of advanced beings from the lost continent of Lemuria. The legend grew from an offhand mention of Lemuria in the 1880s. In 1905, A Dweller on Two Planets by Frederick Spencer Oliver was published, which claimed that survivors from a sunken continent called Lemuria were living in or on Mount Shasta. Oliver's Lemurians lived in a complex system of tunnels beneath with jeweled walls and fur-carpeted floors within the mountain, and occasionally were seen walking the surface dressed in white robes. 
In 1931, Harvey Spencer Lewis, using the pseudonym Wishar S[penle] Cerve, wrote a book published by the Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis about the hidden Lemurians of Mount Shasta that a bibliography on Mount Shasta described as ""responsible for the legend's widespread popularity"". This belief has been incorporated into numerous new religious movements, including ""I AM"" Activity, The Summit Lighthouse/Church Universal and Triumphant/Keepers Of The Flame, Love Has Won, and Kryon.
Several UFO sightings were reported in the proximity of Mount Shasta and are speculated in local legends to be lenticular clouds hiding Lemurian motherships visiting the hidden city of Telos. Bigfoot sightings at Shasta have also been reported in cryptozoology, as well as stories about interdimensional beings connected to the Ascended Masters.

Count of St. Germain
According to Guy Ballard, while hiking on Mount Shasta, he encountered a man who introduced himself as Count of St. Germain, who is said to have started Ballard on the path to discovering the teachings that would become ""I AM"" Activity.

J. C. Brown
According to a legend, J. C. Brown was a British prospector who discovered a lost underground city beneath Mount Shasta in 1904. Brown had been hired by the Lord Cowdray Mining Company of England to prospect for gold and discovered a cave which sloped downward for 11 miles (18 km). In the cave, he found an underground village filled with gold, shields, and mummies, some being up to 10 feet (3.0 m) tall. He told his story thirty years later to John C. Root, who proceeded to gather an exploration team in Stockton, California. About 80 people joined the team, but, on the day the team was to set out, Brown did not show up. Brown was not heard from again.

In 2001, Unsolved Mysteries filmed a segment about the alleged hauntings at the plantation.  The Myrtles was also featured on a 2005 episode of Ghost Hunters.

The legend of Chloe
Possibly the most well known of the Myrtles' supposed ghosts, Chloe (or Cloe) was reportedly a slave owned by Clark and Sara Woodruff. Versions of the legend have Chloe listening in at keyholes to learn news of Clark Woodruff's business dealings or for other purposes. After being caught, either by Clark or Sara Woodruff, one of her ears was cut off, and she wore a green turban to hide it.
Chloe supposedly baked a cake for one of the two daughters containing extract of boiled and reduced oleander leaves, which are extremely poisonous. The reason she did what she did was to get work back inside the house. A maid who was getting the favor of the mistress was a suspect, with some saying she was getting revenge on the Woodruffs  and some saying she was attempting to redeem her position by curing the family of the poisoning. According to the legends, her plan backfired. Only Sara and her two daughters ate the cake, and all died from the poison. Chloe was then supposedly hanged by the other slaves, and thrown into the Mississippi River, either as punishment or to escape punishment by Clark Woodruff for harboring her. 
While the U.S. Federal Census confirms that the family owned 5 enslaved people in 1820 and 32 enslaved people in 1830, historical documentation does not support the legend as there are no known records of the Woodruffs owning a slave named Chloe or Cloe. The legends usually claim that Sara and her two daughters were poisoned, but Mary Octavia survived well into adulthood. Finally, Sara, James, and Cornelia Woodruff were not killed by poisoning, but instead succumbed to yellow fever. Regardless of the factual inaccuracy of the Chloe story, some believe a woman wearing a green turban haunts the plantation.

Other legends
There are a variety of other legends surrounding the Myrtles. The house is reputedly built over an Indian burial ground, and the ghost of a young Native American woman has been reported. During the Civil War, the house was ransacked by Union soldiers, and legend claims that three were killed in the house. Supposedly, there is a blood stain in a doorway, roughly the size of a human body, that will not (or would not) come clean. Other legends say that cleaners have been unable to push their mop or broom into that space.
A mirror located in the house supposedly holds the spirits of Sara Woodruff and two of her children. According to custom, mirrors are covered after a death, but legend says that after the poisoning of the Woodruffs, this particular mirror was overlooked. The uncovered mirror reportedly trapped the spirits of Sara and her children, who are occasionally seen or leave handprints in the mirror.
The plantation is also reportedly haunted by a young girl who died in 1868, despite being treated by a local voodoo practitioner. She supposedly appears in the room in which she died, and has been reported to practice voodoo on people sleeping in the room.
There is also a ghost who reportedly walks, staggers, or crawls up the stairs and stops on the 17th step. Some have said that this is William Drew Winter, the victim of the only verified murder in the house. He was shot on the front porch of the main house and, according to legend, staggered or crawled up the stairs, but collapsed, dead, on the 17th step. Alternate versions of his murder claim he managed to crawl up the stairs, and collapsed in his wife's arms on the 17th step. However, this version of the story is contested.

Consumption (tuberculosis) was thought to be caused by the deceased consuming the life of their surviving relatives. Bodies were exhumed and internal organs ritually burned to stop the deceased ""vampire"" from attacking the local population and to prevent the spread of the disease. Notable cases provoked national attention and comment, such as those of Mercy Brown in Rhode Island and Frederick Ransom in Vermont.

Background
Tuberculosis was known as ""consumption"" at the time, as it appeared to consume an infected person's body. It is now known to be a bacterial disease, but the cause was unknown until the late 19th century. The infection spreads easily among a family; thus, when one family member died of consumption, other members were often infected and gradually lost their health. People believed that this was due to the deceased TB sufferer draining the life from other family members. The belief that consumption was spread in this way was widely held in New England: 214  and in Europe.
In an attempt to protect the survivors and ward off the effects of consumption, bodies of those who had died of the disease were exhumed and examined. The corpse was deemed to be feeding on the living if it was determined to be unusually fresh, especially if the heart or other organs contained liquid blood. After the culprit was identified, there were a number of proposed ways to stop the attacks. The most benign of these was simply to turn the body over in its grave. In other cases, families would burn the ""fresh"" organs and rebury the body; occasionally, the body would be decapitated. Affected family members would also inhale smoke from the burned organs or consume the ashes in a further attempt to cure the consumption.: 130  
One of the early cases, in the late 18th century, was that of Rev. Justus Forward (1730-1814), the eminent Yale-educated pastor of the Congregationalist church at Belchertown, Massachusetts in the western part of the state near Springfield. He served the church for more than five decades by the time of his death in 1814.  

By July 1788, he and his wife had lost three daughters to consumption, including Martha Forward Dwight. She had died in 1782 at age 23. Two more were ill, including daughter Mercy, who had begun hemorrhaging. He wrote in a letter: this morning opened the grave of my daughter [Martha]... who had died—the last of my three daughters—almost six years ago ... On opening the body, the lungs were not dissolved, but had blood in them, though not fresh, but clotted. The lungs did not appear as we would suppose they would in a body just dead, but far nearer a state of soundness than could be expected. The liver, I am told, was as sound as the lungs. We put the lungs and liver in a separate box, and buried it in the same grave, ten inches or a foot, above the coffin.
Justus' daughter Mercy died in January 1789 though other children survived their illness.

Documented victims
Frederick Ransom
Frederick Ransom of South Woodstock, Vermont, died of tuberculosis on 14 February 1817 at the age of 20.: 238  His father was worried that Ransom would attack his family, so he had him exhumed and his heart burned on a blacksmith's forge.
Ransom was a Dartmouth College student from a well-to-do family; it was unusual that he should fall victim of the vampire panic, which was most common among less educated communities.

Mercy Brown
One of the more famous cases is that of Mercy Lena Brown. Mercy's mother contracted consumption which spread to the rest of the family, moving to her sister, her brother, and finally to Mercy. Neighbors believed that one of the family members was a vampire who had the illness. Two months after Mercy's death, her father George Brown—who did not believe that a vampire was to blame—reluctantly permitted others to exhume the bodies of his family. They found that Mercy's body showed little decomposition, had ""fresh"" blood in her heart, and had turned in the grave. This was enough to convince the villagers that Mercy Brown was the cause of the consumption. The heart of the exhumed body was burnt, mixed with water, and given to her surviving brother to drink in order to stop the influence of the undead. The cure was unsuccessful.

Contemporary reaction
Henry David Thoreau wrote in his journal of 26 September 1859: ""The savage in man is never quite eradicated. I have just read of a family in Vermont—who, several of its members having died of consumption, just burned the lungs & heart & liver of the last deceased, in order to prevent any more from having it,"" as a reference to contemporary superstition. When rural Rhode Islanders moved west into Connecticut, locals perceived them as ""uneducated"" and ""vicious"", which was partially due to the Rhode Islanders' beliefs in vampirism. Newspapers were also sceptical, calling belief in vampirism an ""old superstition"" and a ""curious idea"".: 132 
While the press dismissed this practise as superstition, the burning of organs was widely accepted as a folk medicine in other communities. In Woodstock, where local belief was still present, town records report hundreds of onlookers attending the burning of Frederick Ransom's heart.""

Terminology
It is unlikely that the deceased would have been known as vampires by their affected families, because the word was not in common use in the community at that time. However, the term was used by newspapers and outsiders at the time due to the similarity with contemporary vampire beliefs in eastern Europe.
These beliefs were very different from the vampires portrayed in modern popular culture. Michael Bell conducted an anthropological study of the phenomenon in New England, and he rejected that modern narrative: ""No credible account describes a corpse actually leaving the grave to suck blood, and there is little evidence to suggest that those involved in the practice referred to it as 'vampirism' or to the suspected corpse as a 'vampire', although newspaper accounts used this term to refer to the practice.""

The folklore account is based on the historical wreck of the Princess Augusta in 1738, which became known as the Palatine in 19th-century accounts, including John Greenleaf Whittier's poem ""The Palatine"".","The Palatine Light is an apparition reported near Block Island, Rhode Island, said to be the ghost ship of a lost 18th-century vessel named the Palatine. The folklore account is based on the historical wreck of the Princess Augusta in 1738, which became known as the Palatine in 19th-century accounts, including John Greenleaf Whittier's poem ""The Palatine"".

Historical background
The legend is derived from the historical shipwreck of the Princess Augusta at Block Island in 1738. The ship is known from some contemporaneous accounts and from depositions taken from the surviving crew after the wreck, which were discovered in 1925 and reprinted in 1939. The 220-ton British ship Augusta sailed from Rotterdam in August 1738 under Captain George Long and a crew of fourteen, transporting 240 immigrants to English colonies in America. The passengers were German Palatines, natives of the Palatinate region, and as such the ship was described as the ""Palatine ship"" in contemporaneous documents, which accounts for the later confusion over its name. The ship was heading for Philadelphia; from there, the passengers may have intended to reach a German-owned settlement on the James River in Virginia which attracted some 3,000 of their countrymen.
The Princess Augusta's voyage was beset by terrible luck; the water supply was contaminated, causing a ""fever and flux"" that killed 200 of the passengers and half the crew, including Captain Long. First mate Andrew Brook took command, as severe storms pushed the ship off course to the north, where the survivors spent three months enduring extreme weather and depleting stores. According to the crew's depositions, Brook forced the passengers to pay for the remaining rations. He evidently tried different routes to Rhode Island and Philadelphia, but the gales pushed the damaged and leaking Augusta to Block Island. It wrecked amid a snowstorm at Sandy Point on the island's northernmost end at 2 p.m. December 27, 1738.
The depositions paint an unsympathetic view of Brook, who rowed to shore with the entire crew while leaving the passengers aboard. The Block Islanders evidently did what they could to help, convincing Brook to let the passengers off the ship the next day and later retrieving their possessions when he left them aboard. They also buried about 20 who died after the wreck; the Block Island Historical Society placed a marker at the site of the ""Palatine Graves"" in 1947.
The authorities took depositions from the crew, but what happened afterward is unclear. It appears that the crew faced no charges for their actions, and they and most surviving passengers made it to the mainland, after which little is known of them. Two survivors remained on Block Island and settled there. Most accounts indicate that the ship was determined unsalvageable and was pushed out to sea to sink. It may have been set on fire to scuttle it. In some accounts, a woman was driven mad by her suffering, sometimes named as Mary Van Der Line; she was forgotten, according to these accounts, and went down with the ship. However, no remains of the wreck have ever been found, and there is some evidence that the Augusta may have been repaired and sent on to Philadelphia.
Block Island could present a hazard to shipping in the area due to its geography. As a result, it gained a reputation (perhaps undeservedly) as a haven of wreckers who looted wrecked ships. According to some accounts, the locals would go so far as lighting false beacons to encourage wrecks, and even kill the survivors, though the veracity of such stories is debatable.

Folklore accounts
There is a rich oral tradition regarding the event, with many sightings being reported during the late-eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The legend was immortalized by poet John Greenleaf Whittier in ""The Palatine"", which faithfully adapts the traditional story in verse. Whittier heard the tale in 1865 from Newport resident Joseph P. Hazard, whose family were key informants for collectors of 19th-century New England folklore. It was printed in the Atlantic Monthly in 1867, appeared in his collection The Tent on the Beach later that year, and became one of his best known works. The popularity of the ""Palatine"" name is largely due to Whittier's poem.
On the Saturday between Christmas and New Year's Eve, there are still sporadic reports from the locals of seeing a burning ship sail past. Tradition states that a German ship carrying immigrants to Philadelphia ran aground during a snow storm on December 26, 1738 and was stranded near Block Island. Depositions from the remaining crew members reported a loss of half the crew. However, folklorist Michael Bell noted when investigating the legend that two versions of the night's events began to be circulated almost a year after the incident.
The Block Islanders insisted that their citizens had made a valiant effort to rescue the crew, while those on the mainland of New England suspected the islanders of luring the ship toward them in an effort to seize their cargo. Both legends agreed that a female passenger had refused to leave the ship as it sank, and those who claim to witness its reappearances say that her screams are heard from the ship.
Today a marker exists on the spot where the ship is thought to have run aground, by the Mohegan Bluffs, which reads: Palatine Graves - 1738. Some claim that those who died that night lie buried under the soil. However, Charlotte Taylor of the Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission has noted that no physical evidence has ever been found to substantiate that claim, nor the legend itself.

Popular culture
In the 2020 horror film The Block Island Sound, a character speculates that the Palatine shipwreck was caused by the crew being infected by a parasite that drew it in to a sea monster, in the manner of toxoplasmosis and cats.

She is most often identified as Mary Ludwig Hays, who fought in the Battle of Monmouth in June 1778. Another possibility is Margaret Corbin, who helped defend Fort Washington in New York in November 1776.

Suggested identities
Mary Ludwig Hays
The deeds in the story of Molly Pitcher are generally attributed to Mary Ludwig Hays, who was married to William Hays, an artilleryman in the Continental Army. She joined him at the Army's winter camp at Valley Forge in 1777, and was present at the Battle of Monmouth, where she served as a water-carrier. Her husband fell and she took his place swabbing and loading the cannon, and was later commended by George Washington.
The incident was recorded by Joseph Plumb Martin in his memoir published in 1830.

Margaret Corbin
The story of Margaret Corbin bears similarities to the story of Mary Hays. Margaret Corbin was the wife of John Corbin of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, also an artilleryman in the Continental Army. 
On November 16, 1776, John Corbin was one of 2,800 American soldiers who defended Fort Washington in northern Manhattan from 9,000 attacking Hessian troops under British command. Corbin was killed and Margaret took his place at the cannon. She continued to fire it until she was seriously wounded in the arm. In 1779, Margaret Corbin was awarded an annual pension of $50 by the state of Pennsylvania for her heroism in battle. She was the first woman in the United States to receive a military pension. Her nickname was ""Captain Molly"".

Deborah Sampson
Deborah Sampson has also been posited as an inspiration for Molly Pitcher. She disguised herself as a man and enlisted under an assumed name. Her comrades nicknamed her ""Molly"" because of her smooth complexion and high-pitched voice. After her discharge, she successfully petitioned for a pension as a veteran.

Possibly a Generic Name
Emily Teipe has suggested that ""the name Molly Pitcher is a collective generic term, much like 'G.I. Joe and serves as a common label for the ""hundreds, perhaps thousands, of women who served not only as ammunition wives, manning and firing the guns, but also in the army and colonial militia.""

Commemorations
Federal
In 1928, ""Molly Pitcher"" was honored with an overprint reading ""MOLLY / PITCHER"" on a United States postage stamp. Earlier that year, festivities had been planned to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Monmouth.  Stamp collectors petitioned the U.S. Post Office Department for a commemorative stamp to mark the anniversary.  After receiving several rejections, New Jersey congressman Ernest Ackerman, a stamp collector himself, enlisted the assistance of the majority leader of the House, John Q. Tilson. Postmaster General Harry New steadfastly refused to issue a commemorative stamp specifically acknowledging the battle or Molly Pitcher. In a telegram to Tilson, Postmaster New explained, ""Finally, however, I have agreed to put a surcharged title on ten million of the regular issue Washington 2¢ stamps bearing the name 'Molly Pitcher.'""
Molly was finally pictured on an imprinted stamp on a postal card issued in 1978 for the 200th anniversary of the battle.
""Molly"" was further honored in World War II with the naming of the Liberty ship SS Molly Pitcher, launched, and subsequently torpedoed, in 1943.
The stretch of US Route 11 between Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, and the Pennsylvania-Maryland state line is known as the Molly Pitcher Highway.
The Field Artillery and Air Defense Artillery branches of the US Army established an honorary society in Molly Pitcher's name, the Honorable Order of Molly Pitcher. Membership is ceremoniously bestowed upon wives of artillerymen during the annual Feast of St. Barbara. The Order of Molly Pitcher recognizes individuals who have voluntarily contributed in a significant way to the improvement of the Field Artillery community.
The U.S. Army base Fort Bragg holds an annual event called ""Molly Pitcher Day,"" showcasing weapon systems, airborne operations, and field artillery for family members.

Slater is celebrated in the folk-ballad ""Railroad Bill"" (Roud 4181), which has been recorded by numerous artists, including Lonnie Donegan, Taj Mahal, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Andrew Bird, Roger McGuinn, Doc Watson, and Dave Alvin.

Early life
Little is known about the personal life of the individual who became notorious as Railroad Bill. His true name, location of his birth, and details of his family have been debated since his criminal career ended in 1896. What is known is that he once traveled with a circus and learned showmanship and the skills of a performer. He joined a turpentine company in South Carolina and continued with the firm when it moved to Baldwin County, Alabama, and Bluff Springs, Florida. In the turpentine camps he was known as Morris Slater—a profoundly athletic, ""top notch"" laborer and affable individual.

Trouble with the law
Slater became an antagonist of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad after a brakeman found him stealing a ride to Mobile, Alabama, and threw him off the moving train. In turn, the turpentine worker fired his rifle at the brakeman. That altercation led Slater into a personal vendetta against the company, in which he would wound several trainmen, commandeer a train and force it out of the station, and threaten the life of James I. McKinnie, Superintendent of L&N's Mobile and Montgomery Division. The company responded by dispatching detectives to investigate the offender and offering a $350 reward for his capture. Not knowing Slater's name, detectives simply called him Railroad Bill, which was the alias of another L&N antagonist who lived in Mobile. Slater embraced the moniker, and it became the name reporters typically used in writing hundreds of newspaper articles about his criminal activities.
Slater also became a wanted man in Florida after a deputy sheriff attempted to arrest him for carrying a repeating rifle without a permit as required by the state. The arrest attempt turned into a gunfight in which the turpentine worker armed with a rifle wounded the deputy armed with a shotgun. Slater quit the turpentine business and organized a freight-car gang to steal merchandise from L&N trains operating in southwestern Alabama. Their modus operandi was to place a man inside a box car at night just before the train left a station and when it was underway the man would throw cargo from the car onto the track to be retrieved by other members of the gang. Legend states that the plunder was given to the poor, but evidence suggests most of it was sold to company stores associated with turpentine camps.

Gunfight at Hurricane Bayou
On March 6, 1895, the crew of a freight train found Railroad Bill asleep behind a water tank near Hurricane Bayou, west of Bay Minette, Alabama, and took his rifle and pistol before awakening him. To their surprise he jumped to his feet, ran about a hundred yards, and pulled another revolver and engaged them in a gunfight. He forced the trainmen to seek refuge in a section house where they were reinforced by a bridge crew and armed themselves with shotguns. The trainmen advanced on the outlaw, but just at that time a second train pulled up to the tank. Railroad Bill sprang into the cab and forced the engineer to drive it out of the station. As the locomotive passed the section house, the wounded desperado fired on his adversaries who could not return fire for fear of hitting the engineer. When the train was several hundred yards away, Railroad Bill brazenly got off and preceded back to again engage the men in a gunfight. The gunfight lasted until Railroad Bill ran out of ammunition and escaped into the swamplands.

Death of James Stewart
On the night of April 6, 1895, Railroad Bill engaged two men in a gunfight on a rural road near Bay Minette, Alabama. Both men escaped to town and alerted an L&N detective. The detective organized a posse that pursued the desperado for several miles before surrounding him in a barn around midnight. In the gunfight that ensued, Deputy Sherriff James Stewart, a member of the posse, was killed, and Railroad Bill escaped.
Rewards offered for the desperado increased to $500, dead or alive. Sheriff Edward S. McMillan of Escambia County, Alabama led the state's effort to apprehend him.  He was familiar with the desperado and made a public promise to capture him.  In turn, Railroad Bill replied in a note, ""I wish you hadn’t made that statement because I love you, Mr. Ed, and I don’t want to kill you.""

Death of Mark Stinson
To assist in locating the fugitive, Superintendent McKinnie recruited Mark Stinson, a confidant of the outlaw, to serve as an undercover agent and provide information on the desperado's whereabouts. Using information from Stinson, a posse followed Railroad Bill's trail to Pollard, Alabama, on April 12, 1895. But before an attempt was made to apprehend him, Railroad Bill robbed the Pollard armory of rifles and ammunition and fled. He also made arrangements to rendezvous with Stinson a few nights later at a remote cabin by a railroad track in Mount Vernon, Alabama.  With that knowledge, a posse of railroad detectives assaulted the cabin on the night of the rendezvous, mistook Stinson for Railroad Bill, and killed him. Railroad Bill had learned of the plan and had avoided the attack.

Death of Sheriff McMillan
In July 1895, Sheriff McMillan at Brewton, Alabama, learned that Railroad Bill was in Bluff Springs, Florida. The Alabama sheriff, who had also been deputized as an officer of the law in Florida, formed a posse and crossed the state line to capture the desperado on the night of July 3. But as the sheriff and his posse approached Railroad Bill's hideout, they were surprised by the desperado who ambushed the sheriff and had a gunfight with the posse before escaping. McMillan was killed July 3, 1895.
New rewards were offered after McMillan's death, raising the total offered for his capture to $1,250. It was sufficient to attract bounty hunters, law officers, railroad detectives, and Pinkerton agents from as far away as Chicago. The cagy desperado, nevertheless, could not be found.

Castleberry chase
Railroad Bill's trail was located in Escambia County, Alabama on July 29, 1895, and a posse followed it into the swamplands of Murder Creek, between Brewton and Castleberry, Alabama.  For five days the posse, which swelled in number to nearly a hundred men, sought the outlaw's capture. In one incident he exchanged shots with one member of the posse before escaping; in another he got the drop on two posse members before escaping; and in another he killed one of the bloodhounds and escaped.

Emerging lore
Railroad Bill's growing legacy of miraculous escapes, which would ultimately number about seventeen, led to a profusion of tongue-in-cheek stories by African Americans taunting the failure of authorities to hem in the nationally-famous desperado. The general theme of their stories was that he could change at will into an animal or an inanimate object to avoid capture. There also emerged an African American folk ballad in 1895 that celebrated his exploits. Titled ""Railroad Bill,"" the ballad has been sung ever since by an inordinate number of musicians employing varying lyrics but always with a bad-man theme. It also became popular in Europe and Australia after Lonnie Donegan, the ""King of Skiffle,"" produced an eminently popular rendition in the 1950s.  His version of ""Railroad Bill"" influenced a generation of young British artists, including The Beatles.

Death of Railroad Bill
On March 7, 1896, Railroad Bill was cornered and killed inside a general store in Atmore, Alabama. Knowing he would come to the store around closing time, the proprietor staged an ambush by positioning two men with weapons hidden from view. The plan was to wait for the proprietor to give a predetermined signal before they opened fire on the desperado. Their scheme was interrupted by a two-man posse that was also hunting the fugitive. One posse member entered the store about the same time as Railroad Bill and waited for the second posse member, Atmore Constable Leonard McGowin, to arrive. When McGowin entered a few minutes later, he saw the desperado seated in front and with his back to him talking with the proprietor. Although no signal to commence firing was given, the constable raised his rifle and fired twice at point-blank range into the desperado. As Railroad Bill rose to his feet and reached for one of his two revolvers he was shot multiple times again by the deputy and two others inside the store. Railroad Bill, veteran of numerous gunfights, staggered forward a few steps before falling dead on the floor.
However, according to a correction based on an interview with James Sellars (Robertsdale, Alabama), grandson of Sears Sellars who was an eyewitness to the killing, it was Dick Johns (bounty hunter from Texas) who ambushed Railroad Bill in the store near Atmore. J.L. McGowan was in the ""railroad head"" working as a telegraph operator when the shooting occurred and ran over to see what happened. Recorded on tape at age 94, Sears said that McGowan telegraphed authorities and collected the reward money, then posed for pictures and charged a fee for his photo with the outlaw's dead body. Sears' son Josh was mayor of Robertsdale, Ala., for 28 years.

Disposition of the body
The body of Railroad Bill was embalmed and transported by officers to Montgomery, Alabama, for official identification that would qualify the payment of reward money. There was a great demand in the city to see the body, leading the officers to place it on display for a price, charging twenty-five cents per customer. City authorities condemned the practice, and the body was taken to Pensacola, Florida for official identification to receive the reward offered by the state. It was again placed on public display at a price, and again city authorities ordered the practice to cease. The body was transported to Mobile, but on arrival the officers were met with an order from the mayor prohibiting the display of the body for commercial gain. It was taken to Birmingham, Alabama, to be ""petrified"" by a process that would allow it to be placed on permanent display—a practice of carnivals and freak shows at the turn of the century. However, it was not again placed on public display. Instead, it was transported back to Pensacola on March 30, 1896, and given a Christian interment in the African American section of St. John's Cemetery. The ceremony was attended by the mayor and various dignitaries of the city. The location of the grave, however, was unmarked and became lost until rediscovered in 2012 using original interment records. A headstone was then placed on the grave to mark the last resting place of this American desperado.

Robert was once owned by painter, author, and Key West resident Robert Eugene Otto.","Robert the Doll is an allegedly haunted doll exhibited at the East Martello Museum in Key West, Florida. Robert was once owned by painter, author, and Key West resident Robert Eugene Otto.

History
The doll originally belonged to Robert Eugene Otto, an artist described as ""eccentric"", who belonged to a prominent Key West family. The doll was reportedly manufactured by the Steiff Company of Germany, purchased by Otto's grandfather while on a trip to Germany in 1904, and given to young Otto as a birthday gift. The doll's sailor suit was likely an outfit that Otto wore as a child.
The doll remained stored in the Otto family home at 534 Eaton Street in Key West while Otto studied art in New York and Paris. Otto married Annette Parker in Paris on May 3, 1930. The couple returned to the Otto family home in Key West to live there until Otto died in 1974. His wife died two years later. After their deaths, the Eaton Street home containing the doll was sold to Myrtle Reuter, who owned it for 20 years until the property was sold to the current owners, who operate it as a guest house.
In 1994, the doll was donated to the East Martello Museum in Key West, Florida, where it became a popular tourist attraction.

Legend
According to legend, the doll has supernatural abilities that allow it to move, change its facial expressions, and make giggling sounds. Some versions of the legend claim that a young girl of ""Bahamian descent"" gave Otto the doll as a gift or as ""retaliation for a wrongdoing"". Other stories claim that the doll moved voodoo figurines around the room, and was ""aware of what went on around him"". Other legends claim that the doll ""vanished"" after Otto's house changed ownership a number of times after his death, or that young Otto triggered the doll's supernatural powers by blaming his childhood mishaps on the doll. According to local folklore, the doll has caused ""car accidents, broken bones, job loss, divorce and a cornucopia of other misfortunes"", and museum visitors supposedly experience ""post-visit misfortunes"" for ""failing to respect Robert"".

In popular culture
The doll was exhibited at TapsCON, a convention hosted by The Atlantic Paranormal Society held in Clearwater, Florida, in May 2008, marking the first time that it had left Key West, Florida, in its then-104 years of existence.
In October 2015, the doll was taken to Las Vegas for a Travel Channel television program in Zak Bagans' ""Haunted Museum."" The episode originally aired on April 2, 2016, as the first episode of Deadly Possessions, and re-aired on August 12, 2017 as the first episode of the series Ghost Adventures: Artifacts.
A horror film franchise loosely based on the legend began with the film Robert, released in 2015. To date, four sequels have followed: The Curse of Robert the Doll in 2016, The Toymaker in 2017, The Legend of Robert the Doll in 2018, and Robert Reborn in 2019.
The doll and a replica doll sold at the gift shop at the Martello museum appeared in the second season of Ozzy & Jack's World Detour.
The doll was featured in an episode of the podcast and TV series Lore.

Rugg is a stubborn and angry man, born about 1730. He rides out into a thunderstorm in the year of the Boston Massacre (1770), and is cursed to drive his carriage till the end of time. Travelers claim to have sighted him along one road or another, driving a carriage with a child at his side, and declaring that he will reach Boston by nightfall.","Peter Rugg is a New England literary character who figures in several American short stories and poems. Rugg is a stubborn and angry man, born about 1730. He rides out into a thunderstorm in the year of the Boston Massacre (1770), and is cursed to drive his carriage till the end of time. Travelers claim to have sighted him along one road or another, driving a carriage with a child at his side, and declaring that he will reach Boston by nightfall.

Origin
Rugg is often assumed to be a folk character out of New England legends. Actually he was simply made up in 1824 by attorney and writer William Austin (1778–1841). Austin, writing under the pseudonym ""Jonathan Dunwell"", wrote the tale ""Peter Rugg: The Missing Man"" in an epistolary style that suggested reportage. Initially the Rugg story appeared in The New England Magazine, a Boston Masonic periodical. When reprinted by The New England Galaxy almost immediately afterwards, many readers took it to be a nonfiction account. 
When readers wrote into the Galaxy asking for further news and references about the Rugg legend, Austin/Dunwell obliged with two further tales, in which Rugg is reported as having been sighted in New York, Virginia and elsewhere. In an epilogue to the original story, also written by ""Dunwell"", Rugg finally arrives home after nearly 60 years, only to find that his wife has died, his old mansion has been torn down, and the site has been auctioned off for building lots.
The fictional origin of the story is sometimes forgotten or ignored even in modern publications. For instance, Daniel Cohen in his The Encyclopedia of Ghosts (1994) presents the story as an actual report of a supernatural phenomenon, confounding Austin with his fictional first-person narrator: ""A complete version of this story is said to come in a letter from a man named William Austin, who claimed to have actually seen and spoken with the ghost. In the letter Austin said that he first encountered the wanderer in 1826 when he was taking a coach out of Boston ...""

Later use
The story is said to have had a profound effect on the young Nathaniel Hawthorne when he was a student at Bowdoin. Peter Rugg is mentioned in Hawthorne's story, ""The Virtuoso's Collection"", in Mosses from an Old Manse (1842). Herman Melville's title character in ""Bartleby, the Scrivener"" seems to allude to Rugg's wandering. Two women poets of New England wrote long verse based on the Rugg story. Louise Imogen Guiney, in ""Peter Rugg, the Bostonian"", published in Scribner's Magazine (December 1891), gave a new version of the story in which the wandering Rugg was accompanied by his ""little son"" rather than the ten-year-old daughter, Jenny, who was the child in the original tale. Amy Lowell published her prose-poem ballad ""Before the Storm: the Legend of Peter Rugg"" in North American Review (September 1917). In Lowell's piece, Rugg drives through Boston but does not recognize it after many years. Both poets recalled the Rugg story as a ghost tale from their childhood, and evidently were unaware of its literary origin in Austin's stories.
According to Alexander Woollcott, Rudyard Kipling and his English publisher A.S. Frere-Reeves were largely responsible for rediscovering Austin and publicizing the origins of the Peter Rugg tale.

Located on private land, its ruins are closed to the public. A number of urban legends and ghost stories in popular culture have contributed to its reputation as a haunted house.","Summerwind, formerly known as Lamont Mansion, is a ruined mansion on the shores of West Bay Lake in Vilas County, Wisconsin. Located on private land, its ruins are closed to the public. A number of urban legends and ghost stories in popular culture have contributed to its reputation as a haunted house.

Legends
According to popular accounts, Summerwind was built in the early 20th century as a fishing lodge on the edge of West Bay Lake in Vilas County, in northeastern Wisconsin, and in 1916, purchased by Robert Patterson Lamont. According to some stories circulated, Lamont employed Chicago architects for the remodeling. Some versions of the story name the architects as Tallmadge and Watson. Supposedly the renovations took two years to complete.
Legends include claims that Lamont fired a pistol at a ghost one night and was so frightened that he and his family abandoned the house. Other legends include claims that subsequent owners Arnold and Ginger Hinshaw were so disturbed by hauntings that Arnold suffered a ""nervous breakdown"" and Ginger attempted suicide.

Raymond Bober
Although most Land O' Lakes natives refer to the property as Lamont's mansion, supernatural tales first disseminated by Ginger Hinshaw's father Raymond Bober claim the mansion was haunted and refer to it as ""Summerwind"". Some versions of the story claim that Bober purchased the property only to abandon it because the mansion's rooms had the supernatural power to change shape and dimensions at will. In 1979, Bober (writing under the pen name ""Wolfgang Von Bober""), authored a book called The Carver Effect: A Paranormal Experience in which he claimed the mansion was haunted by 18th century explorer Jonathan Carver. According to Bober's narrative, the property was often unoccupied due to alleged supernatural activity and the Hinshaws could not get workers to enter the home to do remodeling work. However according to one of Bober's neighbors, Bober did not live in the mansion, never spent the night in it and instead lived in a trailer on the property. At least two previous residents reportedly denied claims that the house was haunted and locals claimed the haunting stories did not begin until Bober's book was published. A 1980 Life magazine photo essay including Summerwind among ""Terrifying Tales of Nine Haunted Houses"" apparently spread the supernatural tales originated in Bober's book.  According to author Marv Balousek, locals never believed the home was haunted and were dismayed when the home became somewhat of a supernatural tourist attraction.

Fire
In 1985, officials for the town of Land O' Lakes made an attempt to demolish the vacant home. The Vilas County Sheriff said it was a staging area for local teens who burglarized or vandalized nearby cottages. This attempt failed, but the abandoned mansion was later destroyed by fire following a lightning strike on June 19, 1988. Later that week, fire officials reported that the fire was not suspicious and arson was not suspected since neighbors reported being awakened when lightning struck the vacant home. However, fire officials also said that teenagers frequently used the location for parties and that they may have left a fire burning.

In popular culture
In October 2005, Summerwind was featured on a Discovery Channel episode of A Haunting.

While the figure of Uncle Sam specifically represents the government, the female figure of Columbia represents the United States as a nation. An archaic character, Brother Jonathan, was known to represent the American populace.

Earlier personifications
The earliest known personification of the United States was as a woman named Columbia, who first appeared in 1738 (pre-US) and sometimes was associated with another female personification, Lady Liberty. 
With the American Revolutionary War of 1775 came Brother Jonathan, a male personification. Brother Jonathan saw full literary development into the personification of American national character through the 1825 novel Brother Jonathan by John Neal.
Uncle Sam finally appeared after the War of 1812. Columbia appeared with either Brother Jonathan or Uncle Sam, but her use declined as a national person in favor of Liberty, and she was effectively abandoned once she became the mascot of Columbia Pictures in the 1920s.

A March 24, 1810, journal entry by Isaac Mayo (a midshipman in the US Navy) states:

weighed anchor stood down the harbor, passed Sandy Hook, where there are two light-houses, and put to sea, first and the second day out most deadly seasick, oh could I have got onshore in the hight [sic] of it, I swear that uncle Sam, as they call him, would certainly forever have lost the services of at least one sailor.

Evolution
An 1810 edition of Niles' Weekly Register has a footnote defining Uncle Sam as ""a cant term in the army for the United States."" Presumably, it came from the abbreviation of the United States of America: U.S.

Samuel Wilson legend
The precise origin of the Uncle Sam character is unclear, but a popular legend is that the name ""Uncle Sam"" was derived from Samuel Wilson, a meatpacker from Troy, New York, who supplied rations for American soldiers during the War of 1812. There was a requirement at the time for contractors to stamp their name and where the rations came from onto the food they were sending. Wilson's packages were labeled ""E.A.—U.S."" When someone asked what that stood for, a co-worker jokingly said, ""Elbert Anderson [the contractor] and Uncle Sam,"" referring to Wilson, though the U.S. actually stood for ""United States"". 
Doubts have been raised as to the authenticity of this story, as the claim did not appear in print until 1842. Additionally, the earliest known mention definitely referring to the metaphorical Uncle Sam is from 1810, predating Wilson's contract with the government.

Development of the character
In 1835, Brother Jonathan made a reference to Uncle Sam, implying that they symbolized different things: Brother Jonathan was the country itself, while Uncle Sam was the government and its power.
A clockmaker in an 1849 comedic novel explains ""we call...the American public Uncle Sam, as you call the British John Bull.""
By the 1850s, the names Brother Jonathan and Uncle Sam were being used nearly interchangeably, to the point that images of what had previously been called ""Brother Jonathan"" were being called ""Uncle Sam"". Similarly, the appearance of both personifications varied wildly. For example, one depiction of Uncle Sam in 1860 showed him looking like Benjamin Franklin, while a contemporaneous depiction of Brother Jonathan looks more like the modern version of Uncle Sam, though without a goatee.

An 1893 article in The Lutheran Witness claims Uncle Sam was simply another name for Brother Jonathan:When we meet him in politics we call him Uncle Sam; when we meet him in society we call him Brother Jonathan. Here of late Uncle Sam alias Brother Jonathan has been doing a powerful lot of complaining, hardly doing anything else.  [sic]

Uncle Sam did not get a standard appearance, even with the effective abandonment of Brother Jonathan near the end of the American Civil War, until the well-known recruitment image of Uncle Sam was first created by James Montgomery Flagg during World War I. The image was inspired by a British recruitment poster showing Lord Kitchener in a similar pose. It is this image more than any other that has influenced the modern appearance of Uncle Sam: an elderly white man with white hair and a goatee, wearing a white top hat with white stars on a blue band, a blue tail coat, and red-and-white-striped trousers.

Flagg's depiction of Uncle Sam was shown publicly for the first time, according to some, on the cover of the magazine Leslie's Weekly on July 6, 1916, with the caption ""What Are You Doing for Preparedness?"" More than four million copies of this image were printed between 1917 and 1918. Flagg's image was also used extensively during World War II, during which the US was codenamed ""Samland"" by the German intelligence agency Abwehr. The term was central in the song ""The Yankee Doodle Boy"", which was featured in 1942 in the musical Yankee Doodle Dandy.
There are two memorials to Uncle Sam, both of which commemorate the life of Samuel Wilson: the Uncle Sam Memorial Statue in Arlington, Massachusetts, his birthplace; and a memorial near his long-term residence in Riverfront Park, Troy, New York. Wilson's boyhood home can still be visited in Mason, New Hampshire. Samuel Wilson died on July 31, 1854, aged 87, and is buried in Oakwood Cemetery, Troy, New York.
In 1976, Uncle Sam was depicted in ""Our Nation's 200th Birthday, The Telephone's 100th Birthday"" by Stanley Meltzoff for Bell System.
In 1989, ""Uncle Sam Day"" became official. A Congressional joint resolution designated September 13, 1989, as ""Uncle Sam Day"", the birthday of Samuel Wilson. In 2015, the family history company MyHeritage researched Uncle Sam's family tree and claims to have tracked down his living relatives.

Legend
According to the legend, a woman was taken ill while traveling in a foreign country with her daughter. While she lay down in her hotel bed, the daughter made a trip across town to pick up a needed prescription. When she returned, she found that both her mother and the hotel room that they stayed in had disappeared. No one remembered having seen either her or her mother.

Origin
According to the Quote Investigator website and urban legend researcher Bonnie Taylor-Blake, the author of the earliest known instance of the legend was Nancy Vincent McClelland, who wrote a version in an article titled A Mystery of the Paris Exposition in The Philadelphia Inquirer of November 14, 1897. In this version, at the end, the daughter is told the truth by a French policeman about her mother's death from disease. The Quote Investigator and Taylor-Blake also found a version of the legend run in the Detroit Free Press in 1898 titled Porch Tales: The Disappearance of Mrs. Kneeb, written by Kenneth Herford. It is theorised that ""Kenneth Herford"" was a pen name for Karl Harriman.

Variations
There are multiple variations of the Vanishing Hotel Room story. Usually, the story is set in Paris, France, during the Paris Exposition of 1889 or that of 1900, whither, most commonly, a woman with her daughter have just traveled. Sometimes, the women in the story aren't related, but are traveling companions of roughly the same age; rarely, both are male. In some versions, the daughter gets sent to a mental hospital, where she spends the rest of her days. 
In a version printed in the July 6 and July 13, 1929 issues of The New Yorker written by Alexander Woolcott and included in his book While Rome Burns (1934), it is revealed that the mother died of the Black Plague and that the hotel management and the police have kept her death a secret so as to prevent mass panic and hysteria throughout the city, and so that visitors will not leave, thus ensuring and maintaining the hotel's large financial income.

In popular culture
The story inspired several novels, including The End of Her Honeymoon by Marie Belloc Lowndes (1913), She Who Was Helena Cass by Lawrence Rising (1920), The Vanishing Of Mrs. Fraser by Basil Thomson (1925), The Torrents of Spring by Ernest Hemingway (1926) and films such as The Midnight Warning (1932), The Lady Vanishes (1938), Covered Tracks (1938), So Long at the Fair (1950), Dangerous Crossing, Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Into Thin Air/The Lady Vanishes (1955), Bunny Lake Is Missing (1965), The Forgotten (2004), and Flightplan (2005). It was also featured as a ""true story"" in a 2002 episode of the Fox television program Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction. 
There are also adaptations of it in the Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark book trilogy titled Maybe You Will Remember from Scary Stories 3: More Tales to Chill your Bones (1991) and in the short story Hotel Splendide by Australian author Kerry Greenwood, written for a January issue of Women's Weekly magazine. It features one of Greenwood's most notable characters, the wealthy aristocrat and private investigator Phryne Fisher.
Similar themes have been explored in, but are not officially credited to, the novel (2006) and TV series (2023) Therapy by German author Sebastian Fitzek.

Background
Tubbs was born in England around 1761, in the Star and Garter Inn in the village of Watford in Northamptonshire. She became engaged to a British officer from the 31st (Huntingdonshire) Regiment of Foot and at age fifteen followed him when he was sent to the colonies to fight in the Revolutionary War. After the British defeat in the Battles of Saratoga, he abandoned her. With no place to go and knowing no one in a strange country, Tubbs supposedly walked fifteen miles through what was then uninhabited wilderness to the neighborhood of Saratoga Springs. There she settled at the base of a hill called Mount Vista, described as ""a small mountain one mile north of the village"", probably a promontory in the vicinity of Glen Mitchell— Just north of the village of Saratoga Springs rises a bald promontory of rock - called ""Mount Vista"" - the gray masses of which impend frowningly over a deep glen beneath.
For many years Tubbs lived there in a hut surrounded by a brood of cats. She developed a reputation as a witch and made a living telling fortunes and trapping. Stone provides the following description:Had she been mistress of the whirlwind, she could not have been more delighted with storms. She had been seen, her form erect and with extended arms, standing upon the verge of fearful precipices, in the midst of the most awful tempests, conversing, as it were, with unseen spirits, her long, matted hair streaming in the wind, while the thunder was riving the rocks beneath her feet, and the red lightning encircling her as with a winding-sheet of flame.

Death and legacy
Tubbs died in 1865 at the age of 104. Reportedly her ghost can still be seen haunting the woods and she is a popular subject for ""ghost walks"".

Its size was reported to be at least 50 ft (15 m) long, and certainly not less than 40 ft (12 m) Some have reported spikes along its spine, starting from the bottom of the head all the way along its body. Some sightings even spoke of a second member of the species and smaller monsters as well.

History
An 1868 article in the Deseret News announced that ""The Indians have a tradition concerning a strange, serpent-like creature inhabiting the waters of Bear Lake… Now, it seems this water devil, as the Indians called it, has again made an appearance. A number of our white settlers declare they have seen it with their own eyes. This Bear Lake Monster, they now call it, is causing a great deal of excitement up here."" The author, Joseph C. Rich, went on to relate several sightings of the creature in recent times. The article created a stir in Salt Lake City, and within a month ""a news staff member… quizzed many Bear Lake people and found hardly a person who doubted it.""
Leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) took an interest in the monster. When they visited the area on preaching tours, spoke with residents of the region. They stated that they ""had a conversation with brother Charles C. Rich and other brethren from Bear Lake Valley, respecting the monster which has been seen in the lake"" and found that they declared that the testimony that had been given ""by so many individuals, who have seen these creatures in so many places and under a variety of circumstances"" that they (the locals) considered the story to be ""indisputable"". The Deseret News continued to publish articles about the monster—skeptically at times and defensively at others—while other local newspapers turned to attack the stories of a water devil. The Salt Lake Tribune even went as far as to quip that the Monster was ""twin brother to the devil and cousin to Brigham"".
In 1874, LDS bishop William Budge wrote a letter to the editor of the Ogden Junction newspaper, saying he and two friends had seen the monster, which he described as about 5 to 6 ft (1.5 to 1.8 m) long: ""Its face and part of its head were distinctly seen, covered in fur, or short hair of a light snuff color. The face of the animal was apparently flat, very wide between the eyes, and tapering to the nose, with very full large blue eyes and prominent ears, the ears resembling those of a horse, but scarcely as long. The whole face in shape was like that of a fox, but so large that the space between the eyes equaled that of the distance between the eyes of a common cow. It did not look ferocious and was in no hurry to go ...""
Articles about the Bear Lake Monster continued to appear over the next several years, either reciting new sightings of the Bear Lake Monster as well as similar creatures in other rivers and lakes in the Utah Territory or calling the sightings into question. The number of alleged appearances of lake monsters all across northern Utah caused some people to speculate that there was an underground channel connecting the Great Salt Lake and other waterways to Bear Lake. Interest was high enough that at one point even LDS Church president Brigham Young decided to investigate the claims to find out whether the story was ""an honest tale of a serpent or only a fish story"" and went as far as sending a large rope to Paris, Idaho to aid in capturing the monster.
Young was not the only person interested in capturing the creature. One local resident proposed using a large baited hook attached to a 20 ft (6.1 m) cable and 300 yd (270 m) of 1 in (2.5 cm) rope, at the end of which was a to be a large buoy with a flagstaff inserted and an anchor to keep it in a perpendicular position. From the buoy, 100 yd (91 m) of 0.75 in (1.9 cm) rope was to be extended to a tree onshore. When captured, it was hoped that the monster could be exploited for its wondrous proportions in the show business, in competition with the famous P. T. Barnum.
Interest eventually died down in the subject and the phenomenon faded from public memory. Twenty-six years following his articles and allegations, Joseph C. Rich finally admitted that it had all been a ""wonderful first-class lie"".

Modern Bear Lake Monster sightings
Sighting of the Bear Lake Monster continued even after Rich admitted that he fabricated the original sightings as a hoax. A 1907 letter published in a Logan, Utah newspaper claimed that two men had seen the Bear Lake behemoth attack their camp and kill one of their horses, a four-year-old claimed to see it in 1937, and a Boy Scout leader spoke of seeing it in 1946. The last reported sighting of the monster was in June 2002, when Bear Lake business owner Brian Hirschi claimed to have seen the monster.
The monster has become a part of local folklore, partly due to sporadic sightings and partly in jest. For years, a Bear Lake Monster Boat—a tourist boat, shaped to look like a green lake monster—offered a 45-minute scenic cruise of Bear Lake with folklore storytelling. Another self-parody that the locals have done is to fill a float in the Garden City, Utah, Raspberry Days parade with local children and label it ""The Real Bear Lake Monsters"". On another occasion, during the 1996 Raspberry Days, a competition was organized in Garden City to have local school children name the leviathan. The judges decided on the name Isabella, which had been submitted by an eight-year-old girl.

According to witnesses and trackers, it was likely a wildcat species, but its identity was ultimately not definitively confirmed. According to reports, the animal commonly crushed or decapitated its victims, which were mostly dogs.

Deaths
The first animal deaths possibly related to the Beast of Bladenboro were reported on December 29, 1953. Witnesses described a creature that was ""sleek, black, about 5 feet (1.5 m) long"", which killed a dog in Clarkton, North Carolina, approximately eight miles (13 km) from Bladenboro.
On December 31, 1953, two dogs belonging to a resident of Bladenboro were found dead with a significant amount of blood near their kennels. Their owner reported that the dogs were ""torn into ribbons and crushed"".

 My dogs put up a good fight. There was blood all over the porch, big puddles of it. And there was a pool of saliva on the porch. It killed one dog at 10:30 and left it lying there. My dad wrapped the dog up in a blanket. That thing came back and got that dog and nobody's seen the dog since. At 1:30 in the morning, it came back and killed the other dog and took it off. We found it three days later in a hedgerow. The top of one of the dogs heads was torn off and its body was crushed and wet, like it had been in that thing's mouth. The other dog's lower jaw was torn off.
The following day, on January 1, 1954, two more dogs were found dead at a Bladenboro farm, and on the night of January 2, 1954, a farmer reported that a dog of his had been killed.
Two more dogs were found dead on January 3, 1954. An autopsy was performed on one of the dogs and it was reported that ""there wasn't more than two or three drops of blood in him [...] The victim's bottom lip had been broken open and his jawbone smashed back.""
Further deaths were reported in the subsequent days: on the night of January 5, 1954, a pet rabbit was found ""cleanly decapitated and still warm"", and on January 7, a dead dog was found in a pasture near the Bladenboro swamp. A goat was also reported to have died with its head flattened.

Encounters and descriptions
One local described the animal as ""about four and a half feet [1.4 m] long, bushy, and resembling either a bear or a panther"", while another person described it as ""small"" and noted that there was ""a little one just like it [...] running beside it.""  Another local described hearing ""a strange noise [...] like a baby crying"". Though he did not see the animal, he estimated it was ""close to 150 pounds [70 kg], the way it went through the bushes.""
Another account detailed in a local newspaper contained the following physical description:

 It was about 20 inches [50 cm] high. It had a long tail, about 14 inches [35 cm]. The color of it was dark. It had a face exactly like a cat. Only I ain't ever seen a cat that big. It was walking around stealthy, sneaky... 
A group of hunters from Wilmington spent that night tracking the creature for three miles (4.8 km) around swampland. According to them, the tracks showed claws at least an inch (2.5 cm) long and indicated an 80-to-90-pound (35 to 40 kg) animal. The beast's circling movement suggested it might have had offspring or a mate nearby, the hunters said.
On January 5, the beast was witnessed attacking a dog which ran away and was not found. Tracks were seen along a creek bank near one of the attack sites; there were two sets of prints and one was smaller. Later that day, in the early evening, another resident described ""a big mountain lion"" near some dogs three houses down. The creature ran toward her, but turned and fled when she screamed. Outside her home, the tracks left in the dirt road were ""bigger than a silver dollar"" according to Police Chief Fores.
A young boy named Dalton Norton reported seeing what he called ""a big cat"" on January 6, which ""made a noise like a baby crying"" on his porch before leaving.
On January 11, two cars stopped for an animal reported to be four feet (1.2 m) long. One of the men in the cars was quoted as saying the animal had ""runty-looking ears"" and was ""brownish and tabby.""

Hunt for the Beast
On the night of January 3, Police Chief Roy Fores searched for the creature with his dogs, but they reportedly would not follow the trail.
""A half-dozen brave youths"" and their dogs then spent January 4 searching for the creature, while that night, Fores and eight to ten other officers conducted their own hunt. Hunters who traveled to Bladenboro from Wilmington also searched for the beast that evening, reportedly tracking it for 3 miles (4.8 km) around the swamp.
On the night of January 5, more than 500 people and dogs hunted through the woods and swamps for the creature.
On January 6, more than 800 people turned out to hunt for the beast in the swamps. Fores planned to tie up dogs as bait to lure the creature out, but this plan was not put into action. The hunt itself was also ended by officials due to safety concerns.
On January 7, another 800 to 1,000 people gathered to hunt the creature.
During the evening of the 8th, four fraternity brothers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill were the only reported hunters. Mayor Fussell officially called off the hunt unless the creature made another obvious kill or there was a legitimate sighting. The armed hunting parties of previous nights had become too large for safety, and Fores received a telegram from a humane society in Asheville, North Carolina protesting his plan to stake out dogs as bait for the creature.
On January 13, Luther Davis, a local farmer, found a bobcat struggling with a steel trap in Big Swamp, four miles (6.4 km) from the city, and shot it in the head. Woodrow Fussell, the mayor of Bladenboro, told newspapers that the beast of Bladenboro had been found and killed. However, it has been questioned whether such a small cat could have killed and mangled the dogs. On the same day, Bruce Soles from Tabor City was leaving Bladenboro when he hit a cat with his vehicle. According to reports, it was ""spotted like a leopard,"" about 20 to 24 inches (50 to 60 cm) high, and weighed between 75 and 90 pounds (35 and 40 kg). He took the cat home with him to Tabor City. Yet a third man, ""professional hunter and guide"" Berry Lewis, is credited in some newspapers as having killed the animal. There were conflicting reports about whether it was Davis's or Lewis's cat that Mayor Fussell photographed and sent out to the press. Lewis was reportedly hunting in a different part of Bladen county when he shot and killed his bobcat.

Speculation
Many reported accounts describe the Beast of Bladenboro as feline, but do not agree on any one species.
The animal has been described as ""resembling either a bear or a panther."" Wilmington hunter S.W. Garrett also claimed to have heard the creature scream while hunting and likened it to that of a panther. Harry Davis, curator at the Raleigh State Museum, has said that a panther ""never occurs in this country"", and was of the opinion that it might have actually been a coyote.
One local resident claimed the beast had tracks like those of a dog, but also said ""I've never seen a dog that large."" Chief Fores was also reported as believing the beast to be a wolf. He said that ""old folks say they remember seeing wolves in the bay-swamp area and talk about them every now and then.""
C. E. Kinlaw described the creature as looking like ""a big mountain lion"" when it charged her on January 5. (""Mountain lion"" is the term typically used west of the Mississippi for ""cougar""). The game warden of Elizabeth City, North Carolina, Sam Culberth, said that the tracks he investigated indicated a ""catamount"" (this is yet another name for a cougar).
Other people described the animal as likely being a wolverine, while others speculated that the creature may have been a ""wild police dog.""
A. R. Stanton, a man from Lumberton, North Carolina, thought that the beast of Bladenboro was a German Shepherd and Hound mix named Big Boy that he gave to a Native American boy who lived along the edge of Big Swamp. Big Boy was dark and had a ""long, bushy tail"". Stanton claimed Big Boy was capable of leaping over a six-foot (1.8 m) fence and killed chickens from time to time. Lumberton veterinarian N. G. Baird said that it was ""very feasible"" that Big Boy was responsible for the attacks. Baird also said that it was possible Big Boy (or another dog) could have killed the other dogs and lapped up blood, rather than sucking it.

Legacy
Literature about the events of the winter of 1953–54 tends towards skepticism, particularly because of the publicity involved for the town through the sensational news reports.
Mayor Woodrow Fussell, who operated the town theater, went to Charlotte, North Carolina on January 6 to book the film The Big Cat for a day. Fussell told an interviewer that he believed the creature to be a hoax, even though he was the one who called the Wilmington newspapers about the dead dogs. He found the manner of their deaths strange, and said that ""a little publicity never hurts a town"".
A ""one-arm sign painter"" tailored his art to fit the sensationalism surrounding the incidents in 1954, making bumper plates proclaiming ""Home of the Beast of Bladenboro"".
On the morning of December 15, 1954, on a tenant farm near Robeson Memorial Hospital, ""five mediumsized pigs and three chickens"" were found dead, with ""crushed skulls [...] Three of the pigs had legs torn apart from their bodies. Strangely enough, no blood was evident, indicating the killer employed the same blood-sucking traits as the Bladenboro beast."" The next day, a stray dog was killed, which the County Dog Warden said was ""most probably"" the killer from the day before, even though the tracks found at the farm were not compared to the dead dog's, and it was not explained how the dog could have reached the chickens, which were reportedly roosting in a tree.
Boost The 'Boro, a community booster for Bladenboro, holds an annual ""Beast Fest"" in which the Beast of Bladenboro (or ""BOB"") serves as mascot. Boost The 'Boro makes use of the beast's sensational history amongst locals to generate excitement for the community event.

Skeptics maintain that the creature is likely the result of misidentification of known animals, most likely gray wolves.

Description
The Beast of Bray Road is often described by alleged witnesses as being between 6 feet (1.8 m) and 7 feet (2.1 m) tall, with a humanoid style body, covered in fur or hair, and with a head resembling a wolf and large, glowing red or orange eyes. It is purported to have been seen moving as both a quadruped and a biped, and some reports describe it more closely to resembling a traditional werewolf or Bigfoot.

History
The creature was allegedly first sighted in 1936 on the grounds of St. Coletta School for Exceptional Children in rural Jefferson. In the 1980s, several alleged witnesses reported the beast had made contact with their vehicles, leaving long scratch marks on doors and trunks of vehicles. One witness stated she hit something while crossing Bray Road. Upon exiting her vehicle to determine what she had hit, supposedly a large wolf-like creature with red eyes chased her back into her car; leaving claw marks in the rear passenger door. Sightings also have been reported during daylight hours, with several witnesses stating they observed an unusually large wolf-like creature running on all fours through corn fields. One stated the creature was in pursuit of a deer.
Animal mutilations have also been reported in the area around Bray Road with animal remains, including deer and livestock, partially eaten with specific organs removed from the animal carcasses. Another witness reported driving down Bray Road late one night and observed an unusually large wolf-like creature eating an animal which had been hit by a car on the side of the road. The creature reportedly ran into the woods as the eyewitness approached it in their vehicle.
In February 2018 and July 2020, alleged witnesses reported observing a large, hair covered upright creature in Spring Prairie and Lyons; both in Walworth County.

Proposed explanations
A number of misidentified animal-based theories have been proposed including that the creature is simply a gray wolf or a large dog such as a Great Pyrenees or Newfoundland. While not common in the southern part of the state, wolves are occasionally found in Walworth County and nearby areas.
It is also possible that hoaxes and mass hysteria have caused some falsehoods and sightings of normal creatures to all be artificially placed under the same label. Others have theorized that the creature may be an American black bear suffering from mange. Like wolves, black bears have been sighted in Walworth County.

Despite a month-long hunt that briefly gained national attention, the ""Beast of Busco"" was never found.

History
In 1898, a farmer named Oscar Fulk claimed to have seen a giant turtle living in the seven-acre lake on his farm near Churubusco, Indiana. He told others about it, but eventually he decided to drop the matter.
A half century later, in July 1948, two Churubusco citizens, Ora Blue and Charley Wilson, also reported seeing a huge turtle (weighing an estimated 500 pounds) while fishing on the same lake, which had come to be known as Fulk Lake. A farmer named Gale Harris owned the land at that time. Harris and others also reported seeing the creature. Word spread.
In early 1949, a UPI reporter from Fort Wayne sent the story out on the wire services, and the turtle became nationally famous.
Curious mobs of sightseers began to invade Harris’ land forcing state police to be called in for traffic control.
After many doubted the existence of the turtle, Harris made several attempts to catch the beast, including draining the lake by pumping the water into an area sealed off by a dam with the help of Orville Bright and Kenneth Leitch only for the dam to break when the lake had almost been entirely drained. But despite many attempts, ""Oscar"" (named after the original owner of the farm) was never captured.
In March 1949, an attempt to send a deep-sea diver into the pond failed when the wrong equipment was delivered to the Harris farm.
A photographer for Life Magazine, Mike Shea, took 299 photos at the site, but they were deemed unusable.

Cultural impact
Oscar's memory lives on in Churubusco's Turtle Days festival held each June. It includes a parade, carnival and turtle races.
A turtle shell labeled ""Beast of Busco"" hangs in the Two Brothers Restaurant in Decatur, Indiana.
A small concrete statue of a turtle sits on the sidewalk at the main intersection in the center of Churubusco.

Bessie is reported to be snake-like and 30 to 40 ft (9.1 to 12.2 m) long, at least a foot in diameter, with a grayish color.

Sightings
While shooting at ducks north of Sandusky, Ohio, in 1793, the captain of the sloop Bay Rat startled a large creature (snake) described as ""more than a rod (16 ½ ft.) in length""
July 1817, the crew of a schooner reported a 30 to 40 ft (9.1 to 12.2 m) long serpent, dark in color.
Later that year, another boat crew spotted a similar animal, this time copper-colored and 60 feet (18 m) in length. This time, they shot at it with muskets, which had no visible effect.
A third 1817 incident took place near Toledo, when French settlers—two brothers named Dusseau—encountered a huge monster on the beach, writhing in what they took to be its death throes. The brothers described it as between 20 and 30 feet (6.1 and 9.1 m) in length and shaped like a large sturgeon, except that it had arms. The panicked brothers fled the scene, and when they returned later, the creature had disappeared, presumably carried off by waves after its death. All that was left of its presence were marks on the beach and a number of silver scales about the size of silver dollars. 
An extraordinary sighting which was carried by local newspapers took place by the entire crew of a ship bound from Buffalo, New York, to Toledo, Ohio, in July 1892. The crew (including captain) saw a large area of water about 0.5 miles (0.80 km) ahead of them churned up and foaming. As they approached they saw ""a huge sea serpent"" that appeared to be ""wrestling about in the waters, as if fighting with an unseen foe."" They observed as the creature relaxed itself and stretched out full length—estimated at 50 feet (15 m) long and 4 feet (1.2 m) in circumference—with its head sticking up above the water an additional 4 feet (1.2 m). The brownish creature's eyes were described as ""viciously sparkling"" and large fins were also noted.
Crystal Beach near Fort Erie was the scene of another sighting on May 5, 1896. This time there were four eyewitnesses who watched for 45 minutes as a 30 feet (9.1 m) creature with a dog-shaped head and pointy tail churned up the water as it swam about until finally disappearing before nightfall.
There were some sightings of the alleged monster in 1969, the 1980s and in 1993. Local marina owner Thomas Solberg offered a reward of $5,000 ""for anyone who captures South Bay Bessie alive"".

In popular culture
Lemmy (Lake Erie Monster), a wood and plastic sculpture of Bessie created by Len Tieman, was located in the Huron River just north of Ohio Route 2 near Huron in 1994, and could be seen by drivers from the bridge. The sculpture was damaged and has since been removed.
The minor league hockey team the Cleveland Monsters, AHL affiliate to the NHL's Columbus Blue Jackets, are named after Bessie.
The Great Lakes Brewing Company, brews and distributes a seasonal South Bay Bessie-inspired India pale ale (IPA) called Lake Erie Monster.

History
While tabloid coverage of these creatures has claimed that tales of black-eyed children have existed since the 1980s, most sources indicate that the legend originated from 1996 postings written by Texas reporter Brian Bethel on a ""ghost-related mailing list,"" relating two alleged encounters with ""black-eyed kids."" Bethel describes encountering two such children in Abilene, Texas in 1996, and claims that a second person had a similar, unrelated encounter in Portland, Oregon. Bethel's stories have become regarded as classic examples of creepypasta, and gained such popularity that he published a FAQ ""just to keep up with demand for more info about the new urban legend."" In 2012, Brian Bethel told his story on reality TV series Monsters and Mysteries in America. He wrote a follow-up article for the Abilene Reporter News, describing his experience and maintaining his belief that it was legitimate.
In 2012, the horror film Black Eyed Kids was produced with Kickstarter funding, its director commenting that the creepy children were ""an urban legend that's been floating around on the Internet for years now, I always thought it was fascinating."" A 2013 episode of MSN's Weekly Strange that featured reports of black-eyed children is thought to have helped spread the legend on the internet.
During one week in September 2014, the tabloid Daily Star ran three sensationalistic front-page stories about alleged sightings of black-eyed children, connected to the sale of a supposedly haunted pub in Staffordshire. The paper claimed a ""shock rise in sightings around the world"". Alleged sightings are taken seriously by ghost hunters, some of whom believe black-eyed children to be extraterrestrials, vampires, or ghosts.
Science writer Sharon A. Hill was unable to find any documentation of black-eyed child encounters, concluding that the tales are passed on as ""friend of a friend"" ghost stories. Hill considers the legend to resemble ""typical spooky folklore stories"" such as the phantom black dog, where the subject is not supernatural, and there may never have been an actual original encounter. Snopes rates tales of black-eyed children as a legend, and cites an Inquisitr article that advised readers to ""(f)ile black eyed children under the same heading as 'bigfoot'. Believe it if you like, but realize that there is no evidence of their existence, just subjective testimony that ranges from reasonable to suspiciously fame-whoring"".

As with all bogeymen the figure has been used to frighten children into proper deportment. The character is sometimes called Rawhead, Tommy Rawhead, or Rawhead-and-Bloody-Bones (with or without the hyphens).

Origins
The Oxford English Dictionary cites approximately 1548 as the earliest written appearance of ""Bloodybone"". The term ""Raw-Head and Bloody-Bones, and such other Names"" was used ""to awe children, and keep them in subjection"", as recorded by John Locke in 1693.  Samuel Johnson in his Dictionary of the English Language (first published in 1755) defined ""Rawhead"" as ""the name of a spectre, mentioned to fright children"".  The stories originated in Great Britain where they were particularly common in Lancashire and Yorkshire, and spread to North America where the stories were common in the Southern United States.

Folklore
Bloody Bones is sometimes regarded as a water demon haunting deep ponds, oceans, and old marl pits (which often became filled with water to form ponds) where it dragged children into the depths, much like the grindylow and Jenny Greenteeth. Children were told to ""keep away from the marl-pit or Rawhead and Bloody Bones will have you.""
Ruth Tongue said in Somerset Folklore that he ""lived in a dark cupboard, usually under the stairs.  If you were heroic enough to peep through a crack you would get a glimpse of the dreadful, crouching creature, with blood running down his face, seated waiting on a pile of raw bones that had belonged to children who told lies or said bad words. If you peeped through the keyhole he got you anyway.""
Old Bloody Bones is a Cornish version of Rawhead-and-Bloody-Bones according to F. W. Jones in Old Cornwall. Old Bloody Bones inhabited Knockers Hole near the village of Baldhu. There was said to have been a massacre in the area, and it is suggested that he was a ghost or evil spirit attracted by the carnage.
In the Southern United States, Rawhead and Bloody Bones are sometimes regarded as two individual creatures or two separate parts of the same monster. One is a skull stripped of skin that bites its victims (Rawhead) and its companion is a dancing headless skeleton (Bloody Bones). In one cautionary tale a gossip loses his head to the monster as punishment for his wicked tongue. Legends about Bloody Bones eventually made their way into African-American tradition as well as spreading to other parts of the United States.

Etymology
The word bogeyman, used to describe a monster in English, may have derived from Middle English bugge or bogge, which means 'frightening specter', 'terror', or 'scarecrow'. It relates to boggart, bugbear (from bug, meaning 'goblin' or 'scarecrow' and bear) an imaginary demon in the form of a bear that ate small children. It was also used to mean a general object of dread. The word bugaboo, with a similar pair of meanings, may have arisen as an alteration of bugbear. Bogeyman itself is known from the 15th century, though bogeyman stories are likely to be much older.
The word has equivalents in many European languages as bogle (Scots), púca, pooka or pookha (Irish), pwca, bwga or bwgan (Welsh), bucca (Cornish), buse or busemann (Norwegian), puki (Old Norse), bøhmand or bussemand (Danish), bûzeman (Western Frisian), boeman (Dutch), boeboelaas (Surinamese Dutch), Butzemann (German),  Böölimaa (Swiss German), Babay/Babayka, búka (Russian), bauk (Serbian), bubulis (Latvian), baubas (Lithuanian), bobo (babok, bebok) (Polish), buba/gogol (Albanian), bubák (Czech), bubák (Slovak), bebok (Silesian), papão (Portuguese), bampoúlas (Greek), babau (also uomo nero, meaning black man) (Italian), babáj (Ukrainian), baubau (Romanian), papu (Catalan), and mumus (Hungarian).

Physical description
It is often described as a dark, formless creature with shapeshifting abilities. The bogeyman is known to satiate its appetite by snatching and consuming children. Descriptions of the bogeyman vary across cultures, yet there are often commonalities between them including claws/talons, or sharp teeth. The nature of the creature also varies from culture to culture, although most examples are said to be a kind of spirit, with demons, witches, and other legendary creatures being less common variants. Some are described as having animal features such as horns, hooves, or a bug-like appearance.

Other putative origins
Because of the myth's global prevalence, it is difficult to find the original source of the legends. The Bogeyman was first referenced for the hobgoblins described in the 16th century England. Many believed that they were made to torment humans, and while some only played simple pranks, others were more foul in nature.

Cultural variants
Bogeymen, or bogeyman-like beings, are common to the folklore of many cultures, with numerous variations and equivalents.

Sack Man
The Sack Man is a variant of the Bogeyman folklore which, as its name suggests, stuffs children in a sack. It predominantly exists in Latin American cultures, such as Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay, Brazil; as well as Latin Europe, in both Portugal and Spain. It is sometimes referred to as el Hombre del costal, el hombre de la bolsa, el hombre del saco, or in Portuguese, o homem do saco (all of these names either meaning ""the sack man"" or ""the bag man""). Another Spanish language variation is el roba-chicos, meaning ""child-stealer"". Similar legends are present in Eastern Europe (e.g. Bulgarian Torbalan, ""sack man""), as well as in Haiti and some countries in Asia.

El Coco
El Coco (also El Cuco and Cucuy, sometimes called El Bolo) is another version of the Bogeyman, common to many Spanish-speaking countries. The Cuca Fera (or Cucafera) monster is the equivalent in certain parts of Catalonia.
In Spain, parents will sing lullabies and tell rhymes to children, warning them that if they do not sleep, El Coco will come to get them. The rhyme originated in the 17th century and while it has evolved over the years, it has still retained its original meaning to this day. Coconuts (Spanish: coco) received their name because of the hairy, brown ""face"" created by the coconut shell's three indentations, which reminded the Portuguese sailors of ""Coco"".
Latin America also has El Coco, although its folklore is different, commonly mixed with native beliefs and, because of cultural contacts, sometimes more closely related to the US version of the Boogeyman. However, the term El Coco is also used in Spanish-speaking Latin American countries, such as Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala, Peru, Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, and Venezuela, although there it is more usually called El Cuco, as in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Chile, Uruguay, Panama and Argentina.
Among Mexican-Americans, El Cucuy is portrayed as an evil monster that hides under children's beds at night and kidnaps or eats those who do not obey his/her parents by going to sleep when it is time to do so. However, the Spanish American bogeyman does not resemble the shapeless or hairy monster of Spain: social sciences professor Manuel Medrano says popular legend describes el cucuy as a small humanoid with glowing red eyes that hides in closets or under the bed. ""Some lore has him as a kid who was the victim of violence... and now he's alive, but he's not,"" Medrano said, citing Xavier Garza's 2004 book Creepy Creatures and other Cucuys.""

Cuca
In Brazilian folklore, a similar character called Cuca is depicted as a female humanoid alligator, or an old lady with a sack. There is a lullaby sung by many parents to their children that says that the Cuca will come to get them and make a soup, or soap out of them if they do not sleep, just as in Spain. The Cuca is also a character of Monteiro Lobato's Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (""Yellow Woodpecker's Farm""), a series of short novels written for children which contain a large number of characters from Brazilian folklore.

Babau
In the countries of central and Eastern Mediterranean, children who misbehave are threatened with a creature known as ""babau"" (or ""baubau"", ""baobao"", ""bavbav"", or بعبع ""Bu'Bu'"" or similar). In Italy, the Babau is also called l'uomo nero or ""black man"". In Italy, he is portrayed as a tall man wearing a heavy black coat, with a black hood or hat which hides his face. Sometimes, parents will knock loudly under the table, pretending that someone is knocking at the door, and say something like: ""Here comes l'uomo nero! He must know that there's a child here who doesn't want to drink his soup!"". It is also featured in a widespread nursery rhyme in Italy: ""Ninna nanna, ninna oh, questo bimbo a chi lo do? Lo darò all' uomo nero, che lo tiene un anno intero."" (English: ""Lullaby Lulla Oh, who do I give this child to? I will give him to the Boogeyman, who's going to keep him for a whole year"") L'uomo nero is not supposed to eat or harm children, but instead takes them away to a mysterious and frightening place.

Butzemann
German folklore has dozens of different figures that correspond to the Bogeyman. These have various appearances (such as of a gnome, man, animal, monster, ghost or devil). They are sometimes said to appear at very specific places (such as in forests, at bodies of water, cliffs, cornfields or vineyards). These figures are called by many different names, which are often only regionally known. One of these, possibly etymologically related to the Bogeyman, is the Butzemann, which can be of gnome-like and other demonic or ghostly appearance. Other examples include the Buhmann (who is mostly proverbial) and der schwarze Mann (""The Black Man""), an inhuman creature which hides in the dark corners under the bed or in the closet and carries children away. The figure is part of the children's game Wer hat Angst vorm schwarzen Mann? (""Who is afraid of the bogeyman?"").

Other examples

The Lubia is a female demon with an insatiable appetite for the flesh of children, especially girls. She has many heads, from seven to a hundred, and like the Greek hydra if one head is severed then others will grow in its place.
Azerbaijan – The Div is a hairy giant that eats children. It was outsmarted and defeated by a clever young boy named Jirtdan, a popular hero in Azerbaijani fairy tales.

The details vary regionally and by household due to oral tradition, but it always manifests as a menacing hag who hunts irreverent children. It is described as fond of trapping and eating caught children.
Brazil and Portugal – A monster more akin to the Bogeyman is called Bicho Papão (""Eating Beast"") or Sarronco (""Deep-Voiced Man""). A notable difference between it and the homem do saco is that the latter is a daytime menace and ""Bicho Papão"" is a nighttime menace. Another important difference is that ""Homem do Saco"" (""Sack Man"") usually kidnaps children who go to places without parents authorization, while ""Bicho Papão"" scares naughty children and hides under their beds, closets or roofs.
In Inuit religion, there is a shapeshifter called the Ijiraq which is said to kidnap children, hide them away, and abandon them. If the children can convince the Ijiraq to let them go, they can use inukshuk to find their way home. Within Inuit mythology, there is also the Qallupilluit, human-like creatures with long fingernails, green skin, and long hair that live in the sea. They carry babies and children away in their parkas if the children disobey their parents and wander off alone close to the water. The Qalupalik adopt the children and bring them to live with them underwater.
Canada – Within the culture of French Canadians the Bogeyman is called Bonhomme Sept Heures (En: The Seven O'Clock Man). Children are cautioned to go to bed by 7 pm, or else be taken by The Seven O'Clock Man.

Czech Republic – The equivalent of the Bogeyman in the Czech Republic is bubák (≈ imp) or strašidlo (≈ ghost), but these are not typically connected with abducting children nor with discriminating between well and bad behaved ones. This is more often attributed to polednice and klekánice (Lady Midday), or to the čert (Krampus, or lit. devil) who, along with St. Nicholas is traditionally believed to visit families on December 5.
Egypt – The ""Abu Rigl Maslukha"" (ابو رجل مسلوخة), which translates to the ""Man With Burnt/Skinned Leg"". It is a story that is traditionally told by parents when children misbehave. It is a monster said to have been burnt as a child because he did not listen to his parents. He grabs naughty children to cook and eat them.

The legend
Jacob Stroyer, who was born enslaved in South Carolina in 1849, wrote about hags and conjurers on a plantation in South Carolina. According to his autobigraphy: ""The witches among slaves were supposed to have been persons who worked with them every day, and were called old hags or jack lanterns. Those, both men and women, who, when they grew old looked odd, were supposed to be witches. Sometimes after eating supper the enslaved would gather in each other's cabins which looked over the large openings on the plantation, and when they would see a light at a great distance and saw it open and shut they would say 'there is an old hag,' and if it came from a certain direction where those lived whom they called witches, one would say 'dat looks like old Aunt Susan,' another said 'no, dat look like man hag,' still another 'I tink dat look like ole Uncle Renty.' When the light disappeared they said that the witch had got into the plantation and changed itself into a person, and went around on the place talking with the people like others until those whom it wanted to bewitch went to bed, then it would change itself to a witch again. They claimed that they rode human beings like horses, and the spittle that run on the side of the cheek when one slept was the bridle that the witch rode with."" If enslaved people did not have a Bible, they sprinkled a mixture of cayenne pepper and salt in the corners and around the room to protect themselves from boo hags.
Slave narratives of Gullah Geechees (African Americans) in Georgia documented tales of boo hags from formerly enslaved people in the book, Drums and Shadows. Black people talked about hags were ""witches"" that sold their soul to the devil and have the power to change into animals and insects and drain their victims spiritual essence.  
In Gullah folklore, boo hags are similar to vampires. Unlike vampires, they gain sustenance from a person's breath, as opposed to their blood, by riding their victims.
An expression sometimes used in South Carolina is ""don't let the hag ride ya."" This expression may come from the boo hag legend.

Boo hags outside of Gullah culture
While boo hags are a product of Gullah culture, the legend has become known on a wider scale. The legend has been used as an object lesson in stranger danger. The legend has also been the subject of song, and poetry.
In 2005, a boo hag became a character in a children's book called Precious and the Boo Hag by Patricia C. McKissack and Onawumi Jean Moss. In the story, the boo hag is said to be strange and tricky, and it does anything to get into the house. Precious, the main character, is told by her brother that the boo hag also ""...tries to make you disobey yo' mama!""
In Black Wings, Grey Skies by Hailey Edwards, a boo hag has gone rogue and starts killing children and the occasional adult. A group of boo hags decides to help the main character bring the villain down.
The book Hush Hush by Remy Wilkins has the antagonists attempting to open a portal in a hurricane in an attempt to summon the boo hag.
Lady Night, a kind boo hag, appears as a character in Tristan Strong Destroys the World, the second book in the Tristan Strong series.

Sou-Marie
The burrokeet masquerade, associated with the South American mainland and Venezuelan Spaniards, has become linked with the ""Sou-Marie"" character that derives from East Indian culture brought to Trinidad by indentured labourers. The Sou-Marie (or Sumari / Soomaree) mas, performed to tassa drum music and today only seen rarely in the rural areas, features what is called the harrichand dance: ""The costume consists of an ornately decorated bamboo frame in the shape of a horse with a hole in the 'horse′s' back. The masquerader enters this hole and is attached to the frame by a series of straps. He holds the reins of 'the hose' and dances. He moves the 'horse' forward and backward to give the illusion of riding on horseback. Drums and singing in Hindi usually accompany the dancing.""  In the Tamil Nadu (Madras) state of South India, this dance is known as ""Poikkal Kuthirai Aattam"".

The legend of the monster is considered a draw for tourism in the Burlington, Vermont and Plattsburgh, New York areas.

History of the legend
Over the years, there have been over 300 reported sightings of Champ.
The original story is related to Iroquois legends of giant snakes, which the Mohawk named Onyare'kowa.
French cartographer Samuel de Champlain, the founder of Québec and the lake's namesake, is often claimed to be the first European to have sighted Champ, in 1609. The earliest source for this claim is the summer 1970 issue of the magazine Vermont Life. The magazine quoted Champlain as having documented a ""20 ft (6.1 m) serpent thick as a barrel, and a head like a horse."" There is no evidence that Champlain ever said this,, although he did document large fish:

There is also a great abundance of fish, of many varieties: among others, one called by the savages of the country Chaoufarou, ""which varies in length, the largest being, as the people told me, 8 or 10 ft (2.4 or 3.0 m) long. I saw some 5 ft (1.5 m) long, which were as large as my thigh; the head being as big as my two fists, with a snout 2.5 ft (0.76 m) long, and a double row of very sharp and dangerous teeth. Its body is, in shape, very much like that of a pike; but it is armed with scales so strong and a poniard could not pierce them. Its color is silver-gray.
The 1878 translation of his journals clarifies that Chaoufaou refers to gar (or gar pike), specifically Lepisosteus osseus (the longnose gar).
An 1819 report in the Plattsburgh Republican, entitled ""Cape Ann Serpent on Lake Champlain"", reports a ""Capt. Crum"" sighting an enormous serpentine monster. Crum estimated the monster to have been about 187 ft (57 m) long and approximately 200 yd (180 m) away from him. Despite the great distance, he claimed to have witnessed it being followed by ""two large Sturgeon and a Bill-fish"" and was able to see that it had three teeth and eyes the color of peeled onions. He also described the monster as having ""a belt of red"" around its neck and a white star on its forehead.
In 1883, Sheriff Nathan H. Mooney claimed that he had seen a water serpent about ""20 rods"" (the equivalent of 110 yd (100 m) in length) from where he was on the shore. He claimed that he was so close that he could see ""round white spots inside its mouth"" and that ""the creature appeared to be about 25 to 30 ft (7.6 to 9.1 m) in length"". Mooney's sighting led to many more alleged eyewitnesses coming forward with their own accounts of Champ.
The legend of Champ captured the interest of P. T. Barnum, and in 1873 and 1887, the famous showman offered rewards for anyone who could bring him the monster.

In 1977, Sandra Mansi took a photograph while on vacation with her family that appears to show the dinosaur with his head out of the lake. The entire bay of the lake where the photograph reportedly was taken is no deeper than 14 feet (4.3 m). According to Joe Nickell, it is unlikely that a giant creature could swim, let alone hide, in such shallow water. It has been suggested that the object in the photograph could possibly be a rising tree trunk or log. In the book The Untold Story of Champ by Robert E. Bartholomew, it is further revealed that the original photo was sent to Philip Reines, a nautical expert at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh, so that he could examine and hopefully authenticate it.  Reines quickly realized that the two most vital elements in verifying the photo were missing. Sandra Mansi said that she had thrown away the negative, and that she could not locate where she snapped the photo. Without the negative or location it was impossible to determine with any degree of certainty what was in the photo. Possessing the negative would allow the image to be magnified to see greater detail, while knowing the location could reveal important clues such as the object's size and distance, and whether the photo was even taken on Lake Champlain. Reines could not authenticate the photo and the story behind it led to big questions and potential red flags detailed in his book.
Champ reportedly can be seen in a video taken by fishermen Dick Affolter and his stepson Pete Bodette in the summer of 2005. Close examination of the images may be interpreted either as a head and neck of a plesiosaur-like animal and even an open mouth in one frame and a closed mouth in another; or as a fish or eel. Although two retired FBI forensic image analysts, who reviewed the tape, said it appears authentic and unmanipulated, one of them added that ""there's no place in there that I can actually see an animal or any other object on the surface"".
Related, the recording of sounds from within the lake by the Fauna Communications Research Institute in 2003, working as part of a Discovery Channel program. The group described the sounds as being similar to those produced by Beluga whales or dolphins—neither of which are known to live in Lake Champlain. An article describing the recordings has been published to scientific literature, explaining that the sounds were likely a form of echolocation despite none of ""the known native creatures"" being able to echolocate.

During post-production of the film Lucy and the Lake Monster, the filmmakers reviewed their drone footage from production on August 2, 2024, and noticed what appeared to be a large creature swimming just below the surface of the water in Bulwagga Bay. The alleged creature is visible in the bottom right portion of the screen, swimming behind a boat on which the two lead actors of the film were aboard. The boat was 142 inches from the tip of the bow to the stern and 50.5 inches at the widest point, and the alleged creature appears to be larger than the boat.
One of the co-writers, Kelly Tabor, believes it to be a foundational piece of evidence for Champ. The second co-writer and director of the film, Richard Rossi, said that he shared the footage with scientists.  A ten-second clip from the longer five minute footage was shared publicly on YouTube.

Cultural importance to New York and Vermont
The Champ legend has become a revenue-generating attraction. For example, the village of Port Henry, New York, has erected a giant model of Champ and holds ""Champ Day"" on the first Saturday of every August. As the mascot of Vermont's baseball team, the Vermont Lake Monsters, Champ became more prominent after the team was renamed from the Vermont Expos following the 2005 season. Champ has been the primary attraction of the former Minor League Baseball team since their inception, and continues to serve as the Futures Collegiate Baseball League team's mascot. This mascot version of Champ appears as a special guest at various charitable and other functions throughout Vermont. Several nearby establishments, including a car wash, use images of Champ as a logo.

In 2022, media reported that a feature film, Lucy and the Lake Monster, was in the works about a young orphan girl and her grandfather looking for Champ, the film being based on a children's book with the same title.
The production filmed in Port Henry, New York and in various locations around Lake Champlain's Bulwagga Bay in July and August, 2022. Newspapers in the Lake Champlain region reported the film finished in 2024, and premiered in the Lake Champlain region in September, 2024.  As of 2025, the film has garnered multiple awards on the film festival circuit.

Over time, the figure developed into an environmental icon.Chessie Associated with the ecological health of the Chesapeake Bay. It always continues to play a role in modern popular culture.

Claims of sightings
The earliest purported sighting of a Chessie-like creature may have been from a military helicopter flying over Bush River in 1936. ""Something reptilian and unknown in the water"" was observed by the helicopter's crew. However, a Chessie sighting from a helicopter in 1936 seems unlikely as the earliest Sikorsky helicopter flight was near Stratford, Connecticut in 1939.
According to Matt Lake in Weird Maryland, two perch fishermen, Francis Klarrman and Edward J. Ward, spotted something in the water near Baltimore in 1943:

This thing was about 75 yards [70 m] away, at right angles from our boat. At first, it looked like something floating on the water. It was black and the part of it that was out of the water seemed about 12 feet [3.5 m] long. It has ahead about as big as a football and shaped somewhat like a horse’s head. It turned its head around several times — almost all the way around.
In 1978, witnesses claimed to have seen Chessie near Southern Maryland's Calvert Cliffs State Park and in the Potomac River in Westmoreland County, Virginia.
A sketch of an unknown sea creature, drawn by boater Trudy Guthrie, was published by the Evening Sun in September 1980. It was later identified as a manatee from Florida. Manatees are occasionally sighted in the area. Unlike the reports of a serpentine creature, manatees create a ""smooth 'footprint'... as they move"" rather than undulating from side to side.
In 1982, Robert and Karen Frew supposedly videotaped Chessie near Kent Island. Their video shows a brownish object moving side to side like an aquatic snake.
Another claim of a sighting of the beast occurred in 1997, off the shore of Fort Smallwood Park, very close to shore.
The most recent reported sighting occurred on April 5, 2014, at 1:40 am. While parked on the side of Arundel Beach Road directly next to the Magothy River ""when the tide was really high"", a Maryland resident and his friend reportedly saw Chessie less than 5 feet (1.5 m) away from his car. He described it a snake-like creature 25–30 feet (7.5–9 m) in length, without fins, topped with a slender football-shaped head, and black in color, although he could not distinguish between having scales or leathery skin. The creature did not rise out of the water, but the head and tail end ""just breached the surface"" of the water as it moved ""with a serpentine motion"". The witness first questioned himself if it was two separate animals traveling behind one another, but soon realized that it was one creature because of the pattern it created on the water surface. There are no known snakes in Maryland that get anywhere close to 25 feet long. Although no photo was obtained because the witness was ""so busy trying to figure out what the hell I was looking at"" that he did not think to take a picture with his cell phone, the witness was so moved he called the Maryland Department of Natural Resources soon after the sighting.

Environmental icon
Chessie, as an environmental icon for the Chesapeake Bay, was used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for its educational coloring book in 1986, Chessie: A Chesapeake Bay Story. The coloring book focuses on the Chesapeake Bay and protecting its resources. A second coloring book, Chessie Returns was published in 1991.  This follow-up book is a prequel that assumes that the monster is female.
In the 1980s, Chessie became a symbol for environmental advocacy in Maryland. Illustrations of the monster in newspapers and government publications, accompanying articles about environmental issues, gave the monster a friendly appearance. Eric Cheezum wrote, in Discovering Chessie: Waterfront, Regional Identity, and the Chesapeake Bay, ""The friendliness of the monster, too, could not help but convey the sense that the Bay was a harmless victim of pollution.""

Popular culture
A manatee rescued from the Chesapeake's cold water in October 1994 was nicknamed “Chessie” before it was returned to Florida. In 1995, Chessie the manatee swam back to the Chesapeake Bay, then swam up to Rhode Island, being tracked by a satellite tag on its fluke.  Manatees are unusual so far from Florida but this one has revisited the Chesapeake several times since then. Chessie was photographed in the Patapsco River in 2010 (unconfirmed) and again near the shore of Calvert County on July 12, 2011 (confirmed by U.S. Geological Survey biologists).
A statue of the Chesapeake monster advertised the entrance to the now closed Ripley's Believe It or Not! museum in Baltimore's Inner Harbor area. According to a company spokesperson, Chessie was chosen for the facade because it is ""very much a myth of the area"".
The Cambridge, Maryland-based RAR Brewing features Chessie on many of the beer cans produced by the brewery.
The minor league baseball team Bowie Baysox has a green monster mascot named Louie, whose design is based on the Chesapeake Bay Monster.

Name
Chupacabras can be literally translated as 'goat-sucker', from chupar ('to suck') and cabras ('goats'). It is known as both chupacabras and chupacabra throughout the Americas, with the former being the original name, and the latter a regularization. The name is attributed to Puerto Rican comedian Silverio Pérez, who coined the label in 1995 while commenting on the attacks as a San Juan radio deejay.

History
In 1975, a series of livestock killings in the small town of Moca, Puerto Rico were attributed to el vampiro de Moca ('the vampire of Moca'). Initially, it was suspected that the killings were committed by a Satanic cult; later more killings were reported around the island, and many farms reported loss of animal life. Each of the animals was reported to have had its body bled dry through a series of small circular incisions.
The first reported attack eventually attributed to the actual chupacabras occurred in March 1995. Eight sheep were discovered dead in Puerto Rico, each with three puncture wounds in the chest area and reportedly completely drained of blood. A few months later, in August, an eyewitness named Madelyne Tolentino reported seeing the creature in the Puerto Rican town of Canóvanas, where as many as 150 farm animals and pets were reportedly killed.
Puerto Rican comedian and entrepreneur Silverio Pérez is credited with coining the term chupacabras soon after the first incidents were reported in the press. Shortly after the first reported incidents in Puerto Rico, other animal deaths were reported in other countries, such as Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, and the United States.
In 2019 a video recorded by Mundo Ovni showed the results of a supposed attack on chickens in the Seburuquillo sector of Lares, Puerto Rico.

Reputed origin
A five-year investigation by Benjamin Radford, documented in his 2011 book Tracking the Chupacabra, concluded that the description given by the original eyewitness in Puerto Rico, Madelyne Tolentino, was based on the creature Sil in the 1995 science-fiction horror film Species. The alien creature Sil is nearly identical to Tolentino's chupacabra eyewitness account and she had seen the movie before her report: ""It was a creature that looked like the chupacabra, with spines on its back and all... The resemblance to the chupacabra was really impressive"", Tolentino reported. Radford revealed that Tolentino ""believed that the creatures and events she saw in Species were happening in reality in Puerto Rico at the time"", and therefore concludes that ""the most important chupacabra description cannot be trusted"". This, Radford believes, seriously undermines the credibility of the chupacabra as a real animal.
The reports of blood-sucking by the chupacabra were never confirmed by a necropsy, the only way to conclude that the animal was drained of blood. Dr. David Morales, a Puerto Rican veterinarian with the Department of Agriculture, analyzed 300 reported victims of the chupacabra and found that they had not been bled dry.
Radford divided the chupacabra reports into two categories: the reports from Puerto Rico and Latin America, where animals were attacked and it is supposed their blood was extracted; and the reports in the United States of mammals, mostly dogs and coyotes with mange, that people call ""chupacabra"" due to their unusual appearance.
In 2010, University of Michigan biologist Barry O'Connor concluded that all the chupacabra reports in the United States were simply coyotes infected with the parasite Sarcoptes scabiei, whose symptoms would explain most of the features of the chupacabra: they would be left with little fur, thickened skin, and a rank odor. O'Connor theorized that the attacks on goats occurred ""because these animals are greatly weakened, [so] they're going to have a hard time hunting. So they may be forced into attacking livestock because it's easier than running down a rabbit or a deer."" Both dogs and coyotes can kill and not consume the prey, either because they are inexperienced, or due to injury or difficulty in killing the prey. The prey can survive the attack and die afterwards from internal bleeding or circulatory shock. The presence of two holes in the neck, corresponding with the canine teeth, are to be expected since this is the only way that most land carnivores have to catch their prey. There are reports of stray Mexican hairless dogs being mistaken for chupacabras.

Appearance
The most common description of the chupacabra is that of a reptile-like creature, said to have leathery or scaly greenish-gray skin and sharp spines or quills running down its back. It is said to be approximately 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 m) high, and stands and hops in a fashion similar to that of a kangaroo. This description was the chief one given to the few Puerto Rican reports in 1995 that claimed to have sighted the creature, with similar reports in parts of Chile and Argentina following.
Another common description of the chupacabra is of a strange breed of wild dog. This form is mostly hairless and has a pronounced spinal ridge, unusually pronounced eye sockets, fangs, and claws. This description started to appear in the early 2000s from reports trailing north from the Yucatán Peninsula, northern Mexico, and then into the United States; becoming the predominant description since. Unlike conventional predators, the chupacabra is said to drain all of the animal's blood (and sometimes organs) usually through three holes in the shape of a downwards-pointing triangle, but sometimes through only one or two holes.

Plausibility of existence
The chupacabra panic first started in late 1995, Puerto Rico: farmers were mass reporting the mysterious killings of various livestock. In these reports, the farmers recalled two puncture wounds on the animal carcasses. Chupacabra killings were soon associated with a seemingly untouched animal carcass other than puncture wounds which were said to be used to suck the blood out of the victim. Reports of such killings began to spread around and eventually out of the country, reaching areas such as Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and the Southern area of the United States.
Most notably, these areas experience frequent, and extreme dry seasons; in the cases of the Puerto Rican reports of 1995 and the Mexican reports of 1996, both countries were currently experiencing or dealing with the aftermath of severe droughts. Investigations carried out in both countries at this time noted a certain dramatic violence in these killings. These environmental conditions could provide a simple explanation for the livestock killings: wild predators losing their usual prey to the drought, therefore being forced to hunt the livestock of farmers for sustenance. Thus, the same theory can be applied to many of the other 'chupacabra' attacks: that the dry weather had created a more competitive environment for native predators, leading them to prey on livestock to survive. Such an idea can also explain the increased violence in the killings; hungry and desperate predators are driven to hunt livestock to avoid starvation, causing an increase in both the number of livestock killings, and the viciousness of each one.
Evidence of such is provided in page 179 of Benjamin Radford's book, Tracking the Chupacabra: The Vampire Beast in Fact, Fiction, and Folklore. Radford's chart highlights ten significant reports of chupacabra attacks, seven of which had a carcass recovered and examined; these autopsies concluded the causes of death as various animal attacks, as displayed though the animal DNA found on the carcasses. Radford provides further evidence in pages 161-162 of his book, displaying animals who are proven to have fallen victim to regular coyote attacks; thus, explaining that it is not unusual for an animal carcass to be left uneaten while only displaying puncture wounds and/or minimal signs of attack.
The plausibility of the chupacabra's existence is also discredited by the varying descriptions of the creature. Depending on the reported sighting, the creature is described with thick skin or fur, wings or no wings, a long tail or no tail, is bat-like, dog-like, or even alien-like. Evidently, the chupacabra has a wide variety of descriptions; to the point where it is hard to believe that all the sightings are of the same creature. A very likely explanation for this phenomenon is that individuals who had heard of the newly popular chupacabra had the creature's name fresh in their mind before they happened to see a strange looking animal. They then resort to make sense of their encounter by labelling it as the recently 'discovered' monster, instead of a more realistic explanation. For example, some scientists hypothesize that what many believe to be a chupacabra is a wild or domestic dog affected by mange, a disease causing a thick buildup of skin and hair loss.

Related legends
The ""Ozark Howler"", a large bear-like animal, is the subject of a similar legend.
The Peuchens of Chile also share similarities in their supposed habits, but instead of being dog-like they are described as winged snakes. This legend may have originated from the vampire bat, an animal endemic to the region.

In 2023, the sign shop Sign Source started printing out cardboard cutouts of the Crichton Leprechaun and selling them, apparently with great success. An eight-foot-tall version of the Crichton Leprechaun cutout is displayed outside of their store.

Original WPMI-TV report
The video was shot in the Mobile neighborhood of Crichton, located near Toulminville. The community is divided by Spring Hill Avenue into North Crichton and South Crichton, bounded generally by Mobile Street, Dauphin Street and Interstate 65. The leprechaun was purported to be seen in a tree on Le Cren Street near Bay Shore Avenue.
On March 14, 2006, local NBC affiliate WPMI-TV was alerted to crowds gathering in Crichton, and dispatched reporter Brian Johnson to investigate. Johnson had previously received numerous calls about possible leprechaun sightings and questions about it from friends at a barbershop and his church. ""Things sort of snowballed"" when the crew arrived, anchor Scott Walker later recalled, with multiple people claiming to have seen a leprechaun in a tree. Crichton resident Nina Thomas-Brown submitted a crudely-drawn sketch of the supposed leprechaun. 
Among those who were interviewed was a woman who opined that instead of a leprechaun, ""[it] could be a crackhead."" Another interviewee, Demarco Morrissette, claimed Irish ancestry and showed off a ""special leprechaun flute,"" that he claimed was thousands of years old. Morrissette became known as the ""Flute Man"" due to his appearance in the report. ""I actually saw what was sketched on paper,"" said Johnson at the time. ""Some people say it is a shadow from some of the branches being too close and that there is moss on the tree that could explain it. Certainly I don't believe it's a leprechaun!"" 
The piece was aired twice, once on the nightly newscast and again on WPMI's morning newscast. That version, introduced by anchors Scott Walker and Nikole Patrick, was the broadcast that went viral.

Virality and reception
The video was posted to YouTube on March 17, 2006 and soon became a viral sensation, attracting millions of views.
The report received attention from MSNBC, radio personality Howard Stern and received a piece in The New York Times, in which columnist Virginia Heffernan called the clip ""a local Alabama news segment that seems too hilarious to be real."" Reporter Brian Johnson was interviewed by radio stations in Dallas and Los Angeles following the report. Political commentator Bill O'Reilly of Fox News's The O'Reilly Factor debated whether or not the video perpetuated racial stereotypes. The video was also lampooned on Comedy Central's The Daily Show, Key and Peele, and South Park. 
Tosh.0 featured the clip in a ""Web Investigation"" segment in 2011, with host Daniel Tosh visiting Crichton and interviewing those involved with the video. Tosh referred to the clip as ""the Gone with the Wind of Internet videos. It's old. It's famous. And it makes the South look terrible."" Many quotes and elements of the video, most notably the alleged leprechaun sketch, were printed on T-shirts, mousepads and other merchandise. WPMI-TV later auctioned off the leprechaun sketch for $1,100 on eBay, with the proceeds benefiting the American Cancer Society's Relay for Life.
The clip continues to receive media attention annually on St. Patrick's Day. In 2011, anchor Scott Walker wrote about the report: ""It's fun to be part of something that's talked about so much for so long, although some of my co-workers are probably really tired of it. But I never get tired of hearing about it.""
The Bob and Dan Show on KTCK 1310 The Ticket in Dallas conducted a field investigation in 2014, interviewing locals about their memories of the incident. Numerous witnesses identified the Crichton Leprechaun as a local resident named ""Midget Sean,"" a person of short stature. The interviewers met the man, who recounted the story as a prank played on the local community, in which he dressed in a leprechaun suit and climbed a tree while his friends alerted others about a leprechaun sighting.
In 2023, the National Leprechaun Museum in Dublin praised the Crichton Leprechaun news report as ""one of the most significant pieces of documentary film over the last 20 years"", announcing that they would certify the Crichton sighting as a ""genuine"" leprechaun sighting.

Description
The Dark Watchers are described as tall, sometimes giant-sized featureless dark silhouettes often adorned with brimmed hats or walking sticks. They are most often reported to be seen in the hours around twilight and dawn. They are said to motionlessly watch travelers from the horizon along the Santa Lucia Mountain Range. According to legend, no one has seen one up close and if someone were to approach them, they disappear.

History
While sometimes attributed to the Chumash people who historically inhabited the central and southern coastal regions of California, nothing analogous to the legend appears to exist in their mythology. When Spanish settlers first moved into the area they were said to have witnessed the Dark Watchers whom they dubbed Los Vigilantes Oscuros.
The Dark Watchers are most famously given a brief mention in John Steinbeck's ""Flight"", included in the 1938 collection of his short stories The Long Valley:

""Pepé looked suspiciously back every minute or so, and his eyes sought the tops of the ridges ahead. Once, on a white barren spur, he saw a black figure for a moment; but he looked quickly away, for it was one of the dark watchers. No one knew who the watchers were, nor where they lived, but it was better to ignore them and never to show interest in them. They did not bother one who stayed on the trail and minded his own business.""
Along with this, ""watchers"" are also referenced by poet Robinson Jeffers in the titular poem of his 1937 collection Such Counsels You Gave to Me & Other Poems:

...he thought it might be one of the watchers, who are often seen in this length of coast-range, forms that look human to human eyes, but certainly are not human. They come from behind ridges to watch. But when he approached it he recognized the shabby clothes and pale hair and even the averted forehead and concave line from the eye to the jaw, so that he was not surprised when the figure turning toward him in the quiet twilight showed his own face. Then it melted and merged into the shadows beyond it...
John Steinbeck's son Thomas Steinbeck would grow up to report having seen The Dark Watchers during his childhood and later along with artist Benjamin Brode collaborate on a book titled In Search of the Dark Watchers, where they go into the history of the legend and interview locals who claim to have seen them, such as famed Big Sur resident Billy Post.
According to newspaper archives in the mid-1960s, a Monterery Peninsula local and former high school principal went on a hiking trip in the Santa Lucias when he suddenly spotted a dark figure standing on a rock and surveying the area. When the principal called out to the other hikers, the creature vanished.

Explanations
Illusions, hallucinations or misinterpretation of natural stimulus brought on by exhaustion or isolation have been proposed by psychologists. Infrasound, which can be generated by wind, can cause feelings of uneasiness and anxiety in some people and is frequently connected to paranormal sightings.
An optical illusion known as the Brocken spectre is a plausible explanation for the legend. A Brocken spectre, also called a ""mountain spectre"", can occur in certain atmospheric conditions when the sun is at a particular angle. The subject's shadow can be cast onto a cloud bank around them, creating the illusion of a large shadowy humanoid figure.

Its primary haunts are the city's two main landmarks: the White House and the United States Capitol.

History
The story of the Demon Cat dates back to the mid‑1800s when cats were brought into the basement tunnels of the United States Capitol Building to kill rats and mice. Legend states that the Demon Cat is one of these cats who never left, even after its death. Its home is supposedly the basement crypt of the Capitol Building, which was originally intended as a burial chamber for President George Washington. 
According to legend, the cat is seen before presidential elections and tragedies in Washington, D.C., allegedly being spotted by White House security guards on the night before the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Abraham Lincoln. It is described as either a black cat or a tabby cat, and the size of an average house cat. However, witnesses report that the cat swells to ""the size of a giant tiger"" or an elephant, said to be 10 feet by 10 feet, when alerted. The cat would then either explode or pounce at the witness, disappearing before it managed to catch its 'victim'.
In the 1890s, the cat is said to have inexplicably vanished when some Capitol Hill guards fired their guns at it, and another supposedly died of a heart attack after seeing it.
The last official sighting of the alleged ghost was during the final days or aftermath of World War II
in the 1940s.

Explanation
According to Steve Livengood, the chief tour guide of the U.S. Capitol Historical Society, the Capitol Police force was notorious for hiring unqualified relatives and friends of Congressmen as favors, and these men would frequently be drunk whilst on patrol. Livengood believes the legend began when a security guard who was lying down in a drunken stupor was licked by one of the Capitol building's cats and mistakenly assumed it to be a giant cat. Livengood states that upon reporting the incident to his superior, the guard would have been sent home to recover, and ""eventually the other guards found out that they could get a day off if they saw the demon cat"".

Description
The creature was described as covered in hair, approximately 10 feet (3 m) tall, 500 pounds (230 kilograms), and had glowing eyes.

History
In June 1964, the story gained national attention after local residents reported seeing a large, hairy creature with glowing eyes. Police searched the area of the alleged sightings and found nothing. Nevertheless, the reports caused curious thrill-seekers and monster-hunters to besiege the community that summer. Local entrepreneurs capitalized on the event by selling ""monster getaway gas"", ""monster burgers"" and ""monster hunting kits"" — with a net, flashlight, squirt gun, a mallet and a stake. Newspapers in Chicago dubbed Sister Lakes ""Monster Town USA"" and played up the backwardness of the small town's residents.
Several zoologists suggested that people may have misidentified a bear or gorilla. Cass County Sheriff Robert Dool and conservation officer William Rowe dismissed speculations of a monster. Within a week, the hysteria diminished, and the South Bend Tribune reported that ""nobody seems frightened anymore"".
In a 1983 retrospective, the South Bend Tribune suggested that the monster was imagined by intoxicated strawberry pickers. Steve Arseneau of the Dowagiac Area History Museum said, ""I view it more as a rural legend. Perhaps some people saw something, and their imaginations got the better of them"".

Popular culture
In 2016, the annual Dewey Lake Boat Parade celebrated the Dewey Lake Monster legend.
Local brewery Sister Lakes Brewing named a beer after the Dewey Lake Monster.

Sightings
17-year-old William ""Bill"" Bartlett claimed that while driving on April 21, 1977, he saw a creature ""about 4 feet tall with glowing orange eyes and no nose or mouth in a watermelon-shaped head"" on top of a broken stone wall on Farm Street in Dover, Massachusetts. 15-year-old John Baxter reported seeing a similar creature on Miller Hill Road the same evening. Another 15-year-old, Abby Brabham, claimed to have seen the creature the following night on Springdale Avenue.
The teenagers all drew sketches of the alleged creature. Bartlett wrote on his sketch, ""I, Bill Bartlett, swear on a stack of Bibles that I saw this creature."" According to a local news report, ""the locations of the sightings, plotted on a map, lay in a straight line over 2 miles [3.2 km]"". The sightings were not made public until the first half of May. At that time, a local ""investigator of unexplained phenomenon"" noted similarities to creatures in the Kelly–Hopkinsville encounter of 1955. Even though none of the witnesses reported seeing a UFO, the sightings were also investigated by the Mutual UFO Network and associated groups.

Possible explanations
It has been suggested that the creature may have been a foal or a moose calf.
Skeptic Joe Nickell believes the creature was likely a snowy owl,  based on size and plumage, which would have reflected in the yellow headlights of older cars as the peach color described by Bartlett. In addition, the ""long spindly arms"" and fingers of the supposed creature could be the partially opened wings and the splayed feathers at the wingtips of a snowy owl.
Police told the Associated Press that creatures reported by the teenagers ""were probably nothing more than a school vacation hoax."" Skeptic Ben Radford has suggested the sighting may have been influenced by the pop culture of the time, as 1977 was the year Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind were released.

In popular culture
In 2009, the Dover Demon was featured in an episode of the American horror television series Lost Tapes, which aired on Animal Planet.
The Dover Demon appears as a character in the American comic book series Proof, which features various other creatures. In the comic, it is a creature able to see into the future. It appears in another similar comic book series called The Perhapanauts. The Dover Demon also made brief appearances in the comic books The Pound: Ghouls Night Out and Hack/Slash: Entry Wound. A Dover Demon also appears in the webcomic Gunnerkrigg Court.
Additionally, in the manga series Dandadan, there is an alien known as Dover Demon that takes the form of a bipedal crustacean-like alien; with the ability to transform into a stronger form resembling that of a mantis shrimp.

Reports
At about 10:00pm on the night of April 25, 1973, Henry McDaniel heard a scratching sound at his front door. He looked out and saw something that he thought might be a bear. Taking a gun and flashlight, he headed outside into a strong wind and saw a creature between two rosebushes. He later said ""It had three legs on it, a short body, two little short arms, and two pink eyes as big as flashlights. It stood four and a half feet tall and was grayish-colored."" He added later that it was ""almost like a human body"".
McDaniel fired four shots at the creature, one shot hitting it and causing it to make a hiss ""much like a wildcat's"", before fleeing towards a nearby railway embankment, covering 50 feet in three jumps. McDaniel called the local authorities who discovered footprints in the soft earth near the house, which McDaniel described as dog-like in shape, with six toe pads. The police considered McDaniel to be ""rational and sober"" in his reporting of the incident. In a later press interview, McDaniel said ""If they do find it, they will find more than one and they won't be from this planet, I can tell you that.""
Investigators interviewing nearby residents were told that Greg Garrett, a 10-year-old neighbor of McDaniel, claimed to have encountered the creature half an hour before McDaniel did, and that the creature had stepped on his feet, tearing his tennis shoes to shreds. The boy later told Western Illinois University researchers that his report was a hoax ""to tease Mr. M and have fun with an out of town newsman.""
Two weeks later on May 6, McDaniel called the radio station WWKI claiming to have seen the creature again, at 3 a.m. that morning. It was negotiating the trestles of the railroad tracks near his home, and McDaniel said ""I saw something moving out on the railroad track and there it stood. I didn't shoot at it or anything. It started on down the railroad track. It wasn't in a hurry or anything."" A search party including WWKI's news director Rick Rainbow explored the area later that day, and reported observing an ""apelike"" creature standing in an abandoned building near McDaniel's house. They claimed to have made a recording of the creature's cries, and fired a shot at it before it fled. Cryptozoologist Loren Coleman investigated the case and the sound recording.
Two days later, a day after McDaniel was interviewed on local radio, the local press reported that police were called to investigate reports of gunfire and arrested five young men from out of town who had come to Enfield in order to photograph the creature, carrying shotguns and rifles ""for protection"", the men having claimed to have sighted the creature. The White County sheriff dismissed reports of this ""monster hunting expedition"" as an exaggeration, saying that the men were just ""out drinking and raising hell"", mentioning the monster only briefly during questioning. The men were charged with hunting violations.

Reactions
The incidents were reported widely in the press at the time – it appeared in newspapers throughout the state on 27 April 1973, and on 7 May there was an interview on radio station WGN, Chicago and articles in the Chicago Daily News, the Moline Dispatch, Champaign-Urbana Courier and the Alton Telegraph. There were earlier articles in the Carmi Times, and an updated summary of the events appeared in Pennsylvania's Reading Eagle in August 1973. After the arrest of the five men who had arrived to hunt the creature, residents of Enfield expressed fears that press coverage would lead to further ""monster hunters"", who might inadvertently shoot citizens or livestock.
It was suggested that the creature may have been a kangaroo escaped from a nearby zoo, which would explain the ""three legs"" description as the tails of kangaroos look like a third leg. McDaniel was adamant that the creature ""wasn't no kangaroo"", having owned such a creature as a pet while on military service in Australia, and noting that kangaroos have narrow faces and tracks that leave claw marks. Following media coverage of the creature, an Ohio man contacted a local newspaper stating that the creature may have been his pet kangaroo, Macey, which had been lost or stolen a year previously.
A few days after the event, United Press International quoted an anthropology student who suggested that the creature may have been a wild ape, noting that such animals had been reported throughout the Mississippi area since 1941.

University study
In 1978, researchers at Western Illinois University headed by David L. Miller investigated and analyzed the incident, publishing it as a case study in social contagion. The researchers found there were no more than three firsthand reports that had subsequently been exaggerated by news stories and local gossip into an ""epidemic."" According to the study:

In this area of Southern Illinois, it is not unreasonable to assume Mr. M or the radio news team had actually seen an animal. People we interviewed framed the recent events in these terms. Their accounts admitted the possibility that large dogs, calves, bears, deer, and wildcats had been sighted. Some frames suggested that an exotic pet, such as an ape or a kangaroo, was the catalyst for the monster reports. Finally, some people tactfully suggested that Mr. M. had a notoriously overactive imagination and had probably been shooting at shadows. In any event, we interviewed only one person who agreed with Mr. M's claim that he had indeed seen ""a monster from outer space.""

Native American legend
The story of a monster in Flathead Lake originates in a Kutenai traditional legend. According to the story, long ago, the first native tribe in the area lived on an island in the middle of the lake. One winter while crossing the frozen lake to move camp, two girls saw antlers approximately two feet in length protruding through the frozen ice. Thinking the antlers belonged to some animal, the girls decided to chop them off and take them. They used sharp-edged rocks to cut through the ice when the antlers suddenly started shaking, the ice around them split open, and the head of a monster appeared through the ice shaking its giant antlers. The girls used their special powers to transform into a ball and a buckskin target to escape the monster, but half of the tribe drowned in the lake, which is said to be the reason why there are so few Kutenai people. The narrative holds that the Kutenai never strayed far from the lakeshore after that, and white settlers later reported occasionally seeing the monster.

Local stories
According to retired newspaper editor Paul Fugleberg, local tales of the Flathead Lake Monster go back more than 100 years. It was supposedly first reported in 1889 by Captain James C. Kerr of the lake steamboat the U.S. Grant who claimed he and his 100 passengers saw an unusually large whale-like object in the water. According to the story, one of the passengers on the steamer shot at the creature and sent it diving for safety. 
Fugleberg notes that local residents have named the purported lake monster ""Flessie"", inspired by Loch Ness ""Nessie"". Contemporary reports of sightings of ""Flessie"" by local residents and visitors average between one and two each year; however, in 1993 alone, there were about thirteen reports. The monster is usually described as a large eel-shaped creature, round with a wavy body like a snake, twenty to forty feet long, having brownish to blue-black skin and grayish-black eyes. It has often been described as looking like a whale or a giant sturgeon. According to Fugleberg, “When I was editor of the Flathead Courier at Polson, author Dorothy M. Johnson, then secretary of the Montana Press Association, advised me not to treat sighting reports lightly in newspaper and magazine articles. She said, ‘I don't think the monster should be done with tongue in cheek. You have eyewitness accounts by people who were scared and didn't think it was funny.”
One local story that received much publicity described how a 3-year-old boy apparently fell into the lake, and when asked how he had extracted himself, told his mother “The Flathead monster lifted me up"". Fugleberg wrote that claimed sightings of the monster have been blamed on ""hyperactive imaginations, playful pranks, natural phenomena such as wave action, shadows, lighting effects, logs and a number of animals, including bears, horses, deer, elk, dogs, a dead monkey, a loose circus seal and even an escaped buffalo"". In the 1950s, a significant cash reward was offered by Big Fish Unlimited to anyone who could catch what was termed the ""superfish"" of Flathead Lake. A man named C. Leslie Griffith was reported to have caught a 7-foot, 6-inch, 181-pound, 1-ounce white sturgeon, now displayed at the Polson-Flathead Historical Museum.

Investigators now suggest the light was a meteor and the creature was a barn owl perched in a tree with shadows making it appear to be a large humanoid.

History
At 7:15 p.m., on September 12, 1952, two brothers, Edward and Fred May, and their friend Tommy Hyer, said that they saw a bright object cross the sky and land on the property of local farmer G. Bailey Fisher. The boys went to the home of Kathleen May, where they told their story. May, accompanied by the three boys, local children Neil Nunley and Ronnie Shaver, and West Virginia National Guardsman Eugene Lemon, went to the Fisher farm in an effort to locate whatever it was that Edward and Fred had claimed to see. The group reached the top of a hill, where Nunley said they saw a pulsing red light. Lemon said he aimed a flashlight in that direction and momentarily saw a tall ""man-like figure with a round, red face surrounded by a pointed, hood-like shape"".
Descriptions varied. In an article for Fate Magazine based on his tape-recorded interviews, UFO writer Gray Barker described the figure as approximately 10 feet (3 m) tall, with a round blood-red face, a large pointed ""hood-like shape"" around the face, eye-like shapes which emitted greenish-orange light, and a dark black or green body. May described the figure as having ""small, claw-like hands"", clothing-like folds, and ""a head that resembled the ace of spades"". According to the story, when the figure made a hissing sound and ""glided toward the group"", Lemon screamed and dropped his flashlight, causing the group to run away.
The group said they had smelled a ""pungent mist"" and some later said they were nauseated. The local sheriff and a deputy had been investigating reports of a crashed aircraft in the area. They searched the site of the reported monster but ""saw, heard and smelled nothing"". According to Barker's account, the next day, A. Lee Stewart Jr. of the Braxton Democrat claimed to have discovered ""skid marks"" in the field and an ""odd, gummy deposit"" which were subsequently attributed by UFO enthusiast groups as evidence of a ""saucer"" landing.
According to former news editor Holt Byrne, ""newspaper stories were carried throughout the country, radio broadcasts were carried on large networks, and hundreds of phone calls were received from all parts of the country"". The national press services rated the story ""No. 11 for the year"". A minister from Brooklyn came to question the May family. A Pittsburgh paper sent a special reporter. UFO and Fortean writers like Gray Barker and Ivan T. Sanderson arrived to investigate.

Conventional explanations
After investigating the case in 2000, Joe Nickell of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry concluded that the bright light in the sky reported by the witnesses on September 12 was most likely a meteor, that the pulsating red light was likely an aircraft navigation or hazard beacon, and that the creature described by witnesses closely resembled an owl. Nickell suggested that witnesses' perceptions were distorted by their heightened state of anxiety. Nickell's conclusions are shared by a number of other investigators, including those of the Air Force.
The night of the September 12 sighting, a meteor had been observed across three states—Maryland, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. According to Nickell, three flashing red aircraft beacons were also visible from the area of the sightings, which could account for descriptions of a pulsating red light and red tint on the face of the supposed monster.
Nickell concluded that the shape, movement, and sounds reported by witnesses were also consistent with the silhouette, flight pattern, and call of a startled barn owl perched on a tree limb, leading researchers to conclude that foliage beneath the owl may have created the illusion of the lower portions of the creature (described as being a pleated green skirt). Researchers also concluded that the witnesses' inability to agree on whether the creature had arms, combined with May's report of it having ""small, claw-like hands"" which ""extended in front of it"", also matched the description of a barn owl with its talons gripping a tree branch.
According to skeptic Ryan Haupt, even though local boy Max Lockard admitted he had driven around the site ""hoping to see something"" in his Chevy truck, ""paranormal investigators concluded that the tracks, oily residue, and bits of a rubbery substance must have been left by the creature and not the truck"". Haupt explains nausea reported by some of the witnesses as a symptom ""consistent with hysteria and over-exertion"".

Legacy
Officials in Flatwoods erected a welcome sign which designated the town as ""Home of the Green Monster"". The town also commemorates the legend in its annual ""Flatwoods Days"" festival.
Located in the town of Sutton, the Braxton County seat, is the Flatwoods Monster Museum, which is dedicated to the legend. The Braxton County Convention and Visitor's Bureau also built a series of five tall chairs in the shape of the monster to serve as landmarks and visitor attractions. The Bureau rewards visitors who photograph all five chairs with ""Free Braxie"" stickers.
The legend of the Flatwoods monster has also inspired media beyond West Virginia. The video games Fallout 76 and Everybody's Golf 4, contain references to the legend. In television, the second episode of the 2019 History Channel series Project Blue Book titled ""The Flatwoods Monster"" is based on the Flatwoods incident.

The creature was named by journalist Jim Powell, who reported on it for the Texarkana Gazette and the Texarkana Daily News.

Description
Various reports between 1971 and 1974 described it as being a large, bipedal creature covered in long dark hair. It was estimated to be about 7 feet (2 m) tall with a weight of 250–300 pounds (110–140 kg). Later reports claimed that it was far larger, with one witness describing it as 10 feet (3 m) tall, with an estimated weight of 800 pounds (360 kg). Some accounts describe the Fouke Monster as running swiftly with a galloping gait and swinging its arms in a fashion similar to a monkey. Reports also describe it as having a terrible odor, the odor being described as a combination of a skunk and a wet dog, and as having bright red eyes about the size of silver dollars.
A variety of tracks and claw marks have been discovered which are claimed to belong to the creature. One set of footprints reportedly measured 17 inches (43 cm) in length and 7 inches (18 cm) wide, while another appeared to show feet that only possessed three toes.

History
Prior to the 20th century, several alleged sightings in the general area related to a large, hairy creature circulated in an 1851 report in the Memphis Enquirer, and an 1856 report in the Caddo Gazette. 
Local residents claim that the creature had roamed the area since 1964, but those sightings had not been reported. Local folklore also holds that the creature can be further traced back to sightings in 1946. Most early sightings were allegedly in the region of Jonesville as the creature was known as the ""Jonesville Monster"" during this period.
In 1955, the creature was allegedly spotted by a 14-year-old boy who described it as having reddish brown hair, sniffing the air, and not reacting when it was fired upon with birdshot. Investigator Joe Nickell observed that the description was consistent with a misidentified black bear (Ursus americanus).

1970s
The Fouke Monster first made local headlines in 1971, when it was reported to have attacked the home of Bobby and Elizabeth Ford on May 2, 1971.
According to Elizabeth Ford, the creature, which she initially thought was a bear, reached through a screen window that night while she was sleeping on a couch. It was chased away by her husband and his brother Don. During the alleged encounter, the Fords fired several gun shots at the creature and believed that they had hit it, though no traces of blood were found. An extensive search of the area failed to locate the creature, but three-toed footprints were found close to the house, as well as scratch marks on the porch and damage to a window and the house's siding. According to the Fords, they had heard something moving around outside late at night several nights prior but, having lived in the house for less than a week, had never encountered the creature before.
The creature was allegedly sighted again on May 23, 1971, when three people, D. C. Woods, Jr., Wilma Woods, and Mrs. R. H. Sedgass, reported seeing an ape-like creature crossing U.S. Highway 71. More sightings reports were made over the following months by local residents and tourists, who found additional footprints. The best known footprints were found in a soybean field belonging to local filling station owner Scott Keith. They were scrutinized by game warden Carl Galyon, who was unable to confirm their authenticity. Like the Ford prints, they appeared to indicate that the creature had only three toes.
The incident began to attract substantial interest after news spread about the Ford sighting. The Little Rock, Arkansas, radio station KAAY posted a $1,090 bounty on the creature. Several attempts were made to track the creature with dogs, but they were unable to follow its scent. When hunters began to take interest in the Fouke Monster, Miller County Sheriff Leslie Greer was forced to put a temporary ""no guns"" policy in place in order to preserve public safety. In 1971, three people were fined $59 each ""for filing a fraudulent monster report.""
After an initial surge of attention, public interest in the creature decreased until it gained national recognition in 1973 when Charles B. Pierce released a docudrama horror film about the creature in 1972, The Legend of Boggy Creek. 
By late 1974, interest had waned again and sightings all but stopped; only to begin again in March 1978 when tracks were reportedly found by two brothers prospecting in Russellville, Arkansas. There were also sightings in Center Ridge, Arkansas. On June 26 of that same year, a sighting was reported in Crossett, Arkansas. During this period the creature was blamed for missing livestock and attacks on several dogs.
Since the initial clusters of sightings during the 1970s, there have been sporadic reports of the creature. In 1991, the creature was reportedly seen jumping from a bridge. There were forty reported sightings in 1997 and, in 1998, the creature was reportedly sighted in a dry creek bed 5 miles (8 km) south of Fouke.

Investigation
One month after the Ford sighting, Southern State College (now known as Southern Arkansas University) archaeologist Frank Schambach determined that ""There is a 99 percent chance the tracks are a hoax.""
According to Schambach, the tracks could not be from a species of ape, as claimed by witnesses, because they were from a three-toed creature, whereas all primates, including hominids, have five toes. In addition to the number of toes, Schambach cited several other anomalies as part of his conclusion: the region had no history of primate activity, ruling out the possibility of the creature being the remnants of an indigenous species; all apes are completely diurnal, as the Fouke Monster was reported to be nocturnal.
By 1986, the mayor of Fouke, Virgil Roberts, and former Miller County Sheriff Leslie Greer, were of the opinion that the alleged Fouke Monster tracks were man-made. Greer's working colleague at that time, Chief Deputy H. L. Phillips, said that he had not taken calls regarding the monster in years. He does not believe the creature exists, stating, ""...I don't believe in it. But I'd say you don't argue with people who say they've seen it. Many were respectable and responsible folks"".
The Skeptoid podcast concludes ""So in total, every last shred of evidence that the Fouke Monster exists at all is anecdotal. Not a single piece is testable. The Fouke Monster fits very poorly with the model of a living animal, but fits very well with a local legend.""

Festival
Since 2013, the Fouke Monster Festival, previously called the Boggy Creek Festival, has been an annual event dedicated to discussions, presentations, and lore related to the creature and other similar monsters. Proceeds benefit the Fouke School District, with over $3,000 having been raised in 2019.

Films
The Legend of Boggy Creek (1972)
The story of Bobby Ford's encounter with the Fouke Monster was the subject of a 1972, docudrama horror film, The Legend of Boggy Creek (initially titled Tracking the Fouke Monster), which played in movie and drive-in theaters around the country. It was written by Earl E. Smith and directed by Charles B. Pierce. The part of Bobby Ford was played by Glenn Carruth and the part of Elizabeth Ford was played by Bunny Dees. Fouke Garage owner Willie E. Smith, on whose land three-toed footprints were found, starred as himself. Many characters were named after the people who played them. Much of the film was shot on location in Fouke and nearby Texarkana, though some scenes also were filmed in Shreveport, Louisiana. Most of the cast were local people or Texarkana college students. The film is believed to have cost $160,000 to make. It grossed $20 million at the box office.

Return to Boggy Creek (1977)
A second Fouke Monster film, Return to Boggy Creek, was filmed and released in 1977. The movie had an entirely fictional plot and was not intended to be a sequel. It was directed by Tom Moore, written by John David Woody, and starred Dawn Wells as the mother of three children who become lost in the swamp. Some of the film's scenes were shot on location in Dallas, Texas, and Loreauville and Iberia Parish, Louisiana.

Boggy Creek II: And The Legend Continues (1985)
Originally titled The Barbaric Beast of Boggy Creek, Part II, the third Fouke Monster film was written as a sequel to the original film. Charles B. Pierce wrote, directed, and played the role of Brian Lockart, a University of Arkansas professor who leads a group of students into the swamps around Fouke. The film was shot on location in Fouke but included some scenes shot at the University of Arkansas.
In 1999, Boggy Creek II: And The Legend Continues was lampooned in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.

Boggy Creek: The Legend Is True (2010)
Boggy Creek: The Legend Is True was released to home video in 2011. Early buzz suggested that the film, directed by Brian T. Jaynes, was to be a remake of Charles B. Pierce's original 1972 film. However, it is an unrelated story set in the fictional town of Boggy Creek, Texas. Even so, the film obviously draws influence from Pierce's film with its small-town setting and use of spooky swampscapes for this Southern Sasquatch horror slasher.

The Legacy of Boggy Creek (2011)
This low-budget indie film was originally released in 2009 under the title The Skunkape Story, but was later re-edited and released to home video in 2011 as The Legacy of Boggy Creek. The docudrama chronicles the events that began after the original attacks in Fouke. It was written and directed by Dustin Ferguson.

Boggy Creek Monster (2016)
In 2016, a documentary film about the Fouke Monster entitled Boggy Creek Monster was released. Directed by Seth Breedlove, who co-produced the film with Lyle Blackburn under the banner of Breedlove's production company Small Town Monsters, it was filmed in Fouke and features accounts from claimed eyewitnesses of the purported creature.

The earliest alleged sighting of such a creature off Cape Ann was recorded in 1638 by John Josselyn. Occasional sightings continue into the 21st century.

History
Although the Indigenous People of Cape Ann had told the settlers about a sea serpent, the earliest recorded sighting of the Gloucester Sea Serpent was in 1817, when a group of fishermen reportedly saw a 60 ft (18 m) serpent-like creature with a head like a turtle swimming in the waters off the coast of Gloucester. The sightings continued sporadically throughout the 19th century, with many local fishermen claiming to have seen the creature while out at sea.
One of the most famous sightings of the Gloucester Sea Serpent occurred in August 1817, when a group of men aboard the schooner ""Caravan"" reported seeing a large creature with a head like a serpent and a hump-backed body swimming alongside their vessel. The crew fired a cannon at the creature, but it disappeared beneath the water and was not seen again.

Description
Over the years, numerous other sightings of the Gloucester Sea Serpent have been reported, with descriptions of the creature varying widely. Some have described it as a long, snake-like creature, while others have reported seeing a hump-backed creature with a head like a horse, a seal or a dinosaur. Because hundreds, and possibly even thousands of people saw the creature, combined with the Linnaean Society's report, this serpent is one of the most well documented sea serpents ever. Despite the numerous sightings and tales of encounters, the existence of the Gloucester Sea Serpent remains a subject of debate and skepticism. Some have speculated that the creature could be a large species of eel, while others have suggested that it may be a hoax or the result of misidentification of known marine animals.
The last sighting may have been when the crew of a Gloucester fishing vessel claimed to have had an up close encounter with a sea serpent matching that description circa 1980. The fishermen had initially pledged not to say a word to anyone about their experience, but the story got out. When questioned, as a group they said they were experienced fishermen and knew what they saw. It was unlike anything they had ever seen, and when it turned its head and stared straight at them, its serpentine eyes were pure evil. The men never spoke of it again.

Cryptozoology
Such attention has drawn the notice of those within the Cryptozoology community, including the field's founder, Bernard Heuvelmans. Heuvelmans outlined sightings of the creature in his book, In the Wake of the Sea-Serpents, originally titled, Le Grand Serpent-de-Mer.
Several witnesses had reported seeing a stinger or spear protruding from the head of the creature, which has led Joe Nickell to conclude that the creature is a narwhal.

In popular culture
The creature has become a beloved symbol of the town of Gloucester, with many local businesses and organizations using its image in their logos and promotional materials. The Gloucester Sea Serpent continues to fascinate and intrigue both locals and visitors alike.
Charleston playwright William Crafts lampooned the reports of the serpent in his play The sea serpent; or, Gloucester hoax: A dramatic jeu d'esprit, in three acts, published in 1819.

History
In May of 1971, University of Maryland student George Lizama completed an undergraduate folklore project on the Goatman that was later added to the Maryland Folklife Archives. In Lizama’s paper, the Goatman was said to be located on Tucker Road in Clinton, Maryland. Later the same year, reporter Karen Hosler discovered Lizama’s project in the Maryland Folklife Archives and reported on it in the Prince George’s County News in October 1971, this time placing the Goatman near Fletchertown Road in Bowie, Maryland. Additionally, this report covered the theory that the Goatman’s origins can be traced to the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center.
While Goatman stories originated in the early 1970s, some of its legends are set in the late 1930s, within Prince George's County, following the disappearances and/or deaths of multiple dogs, which were later attributed to the creature. However, given the condition of the remains, the deaths may more likely have been the result of passing trains. Despite evidence to the contrary, stories of Goatman's existence continued to circulate, especially among local students. Graffiti reading ""Goatman was here"" were not uncommon, and law enforcement would habitually receive calls of reported sightings, albeit with a number being pranks.
The creature was commonly claimed to have a human face but with a body covered in hair. However, descriptions differed on whether Goatman greatly resembled a hairy humanoid or a human with the lower portion of a goat, similar to the fauns of Greek mythology.
As well, Goatman was rumored to reside in a makeshift shelter in the wooded region of northeastern Prince George's County near the abandoned trailer parks. Occasionally, it was rumored that Goatman would venture out to kill any living thing such as animals, humans, etc .

Variations
According to some variations of the legend, Goatman is said to have once been a scientist, Dr. Stephen Fletcher, who worked in the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center. In this version, an experiment on goats backfires and the scientist mutates into a half man, half goat creature who begins aggressively attacking cars in the vicinity of Beltsville, Maryland. Another variation of the legend holds that Goatman himself was an old hermit who lived in the woods and often could be seen walking alone at night along Fletchertown Road.
According to University of Maryland folklorist Barry Pearson, the Goatman legends began ""long, long, long"" ago and were further popularized in 1971 when the death of a dog was blamed on Goatman by local residents. Pearson relates that ""bored teenagers"" keep the Goatman legend alive by repeating the story and suggesting that the creature attacks couples, frequenting the local lover's lane, subsequently stirring interest in sites like Fletchertown Road.

The hodag was said to be born from the ashes of cremated oxen, as the incarnation of the accumulation of abuse the animals had suffered at the hands of their masters. The history of the hodag is strongly tied to Rhinelander, Wisconsin, where it was claimed to have been discovered. The hodag has figured prominently in early Paul Bunyan stories.

Origins
In 1893, newspapers reported the discovery of a hodag in Rhinelander, Wisconsin. The articles claimed the hodag had ""the head of a frog, the grinning face of a giant elephant, thick short legs set off by huge claws, the back of a dinosaur, and a long tail with spears at the end"". The reports were instigated by well-known Wisconsin land surveyor, timber cruiser and prankster Eugene Shepard, who rounded up a group of local people to capture the animal. The group reported that they needed to use dynamite to kill the beast.
A photograph of the remains of the charred beast was released to the media. It was ""the fiercest, strangest, most frightening monster ever to set razor sharp claws on the earth. It became extinct after its main food source, all white bulldogs, became scarce in the area.""

Hoax
Shepard claimed to have captured another hodag in 1896, and this one was captured alive. According to Shepard's reports, he and several bear wrestlers placed chloroform on the end of a long pole, which they worked into the cave of the creature where it was overcome.
He displayed this hodag at the first Oneida County fair. Thousands of people came to see the hodag at the fair or at Shepard's display in a shanty at his house. Having connected wires to it, Shepard would occasionally move the creature, which would typically send the already-skittish viewers fleeing the display.
As newspapers locally, statewide, and then nationally began picking up the story of the apparently remarkable living creature, a small group of scientists from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. announced they would be traveling to Rhinelander to inspect the apparent discovery. Their mere announcement spelled the end, as Shepard was then forced to admit that the hodag was a hoax.

Legacy
The hodag became the official symbol of Rhinelander, Wisconsin. It is the mascot of Rhinelander High School, and lends its name to numerous Rhinelander area businesses and organizations, including the annual music festival, Hodag Country Festival. The city of Rhinelander's web site calls Rhinelander ""The Home of the Hodag"". A larger-than-life fiberglass sculpture of a hodag, created by Tracy Goberville, a local artist, resides on the grounds of the Rhinelander Area Chamber of Commerce where it draws thousands of visitors each year. Rhinelander Ice Arena houses two hodags, one a full body creature just inside the entrance, and the other one an oversized head that blows smoke and has red eyes that light up, located in the corner just off the ice and which was created by the same artist who designed and built the Chamber Hodag.

Derenberger press conference
On November 3, 1966, Woodrow Derenberger, a Parkersburg, West Virginia sewing machine salesman, held a press conference about his supposed encounter with a spaceman.
At the conference, Derenberger told press that on the night before, November 2, shortly before 7:30 PM, he was driving home along Interstate 77 when he saw an unidentified flying object resembling a ""old kerosene lamp globe, having a flat bottom and a domelike top"", which blocked the road ahead of him and forced him to stop. According to Derenberger, a man he described as six feet tall with an olive complexion, dark brown hair, and wearing a glossy dark blue coat emerged from the object, walked up to his vehicle and spoke to him ""telepathically"". According to Derenberger, ""he had a smile on his face, he appeared very courteous and friendly"".
Derenberger said the man identified himself as ""Cold"" and told him, ""Be not frightened"" and ""Have no fear. We come from a country that is not nearly as powerful as yours. We mean you no harm"". According to Derenberg, Cold promised to contact him again and suggested he contact local authorities. In the story, Cold communicated with him for about 10 minutes, after which, Cold returned to the object which rose into the sky and left. Derebenger told press he reported the events to Parkland police after arriving home.

Derenberger's story sparked a ""media frenzy"". The following afternoon at 4 PM, WTAP-TV aired a 30-minute interview with Derenberger. Following the interview, other people claimed to have encountered a man of similar description, and local newspapers ran stories about the mysterious figure for the next three weeks.

Later claims
Derenberger's account was revisited the following year in the wake of the Michigan ""swamp gas"" UFO reports. In 1968, Derenberger gave a lecture on his UFO claims in Youngstown. By 1969, Derenberger claimed regular contact with extra-terrestrials, saying he personally had flown to their planet twice. Derenberger appeared on radio to promote his claims in 1971. That year, his claims were the subject of a book by Harold W. Hubbard titled Visitors from Lanulos.
Derenberger died in 1990.

Alleged link to ""Mothman""
Indrid Cold was popularized by John Keel in his 1970 book, Strange Creatures From Time And Space, which devotes a chapter to ""The Grinning Man"", as Keel dubbed him. According to Keel, on October 11, 1966 two boys in Elizabeth, New Jersey reported seeing ""the strangest guy we ever saw"", a very tall man in reflective green coveralls who was standing behind a wire fence in a location the boys believed to be inaccessible. Keel relates that the man looked at the boys and grinned. Keel suggested the Derenberger's gently-smiling extraterrestrial and the boys' grinning stranger were the same entity. Keel also relayed that Derenberger had supplied a full name for his extraterrestrial contact: ""Indrid Cold"". 
While Keel's account suggested that both the boys and Derenberger encountered beings with large, exaggerated grins, Skeptic Brian Dunning notes that Derenberger's story never specified any unusual grin. According to folklorist David Clarke, Keel's own distinction ""between fact and fiction was a very fine one"". In his 1975 book The Mothman Prophecies, Keel suggested Cold was linked to Mothman reports in Point Pleasant which began on November 15, 1966, thirteen days after Derenberger's press conference.
In the May/June 2002 issue of Skeptical Inquirer, journalist John C. Sherwood, a former business associate of UFO researcher Gray Barker, published an analysis of private letters between Keel and Barker during the period of Keel's investigation. In the article, ""Gray Barker's Book of Bunk,"" Sherwood reported finding significant differences between what Keel wrote at the time of his investigation and what he wrote in his first book about the Mothman reports, raising questions about the book's accuracy. Sherwood also reported that Keel, who was well known for writing humorous and outrageous letters to friends and associates, would not assist him in clarifying the differences.

In popular culture
Indrid Cold appeared as a character in the 2002 film The Mothman Prophecies, loosely inspired by Keel's book, where he was played by actor Bill Laing. In a 2016 episode of anthology series Scary Endings, actor Grant Geller played Cold. Indrid appears as a random encounter in the 2018 video game Fallout 76, as does the Mothman.

Irrwurzen or Irrwurzeln) or Irrkraut (""astray herb""; pl. Irrkräuter) is a legendary plant from German-speaking countries. In France it is known as herbe d'égarement (""herb of befuddlement""; pl. herbes d'égarement) among other names.","The Irrwurz (German: [ˈɪʁˌvʊʁts]), Irrwurzel (both ""astray root""; pl. Irrwurzen or Irrwurzeln) or Irrkraut (""astray herb""; pl. Irrkräuter) is a legendary plant from German-speaking countries. In France it is known as herbe d'égarement (""herb of befuddlement""; pl. herbes d'égarement) among other names.

The German Irrwurz
Botanical identity
The exact botanical identity of the Irrwurz varies. Sometimes it is identified with fern, though not in Tyrol where fern and Irrwurzel are said to be completely different plants. It is also said to be a special kind of tree root, namely one growing crosswise, one growing like St. Andrew's cross, or one belonging to a tree hit by lightning. Furthermore, it also gets identified or confused with another kind of plant with legendary features, the springwort (German Springwurzel).

Traits
The typical trait of the Irrwurz is that whoever steps on it goes astray and cannot find the way back. This plant, according to legend, is often found growing in forests, this being the reason people get lost in the woods. In Thuringia it is specified that a person only goes astray when stepping over Irrkraut (here: fern) without seeing it. In Tyrol, stepping on an Irrwurz immediately transfers you to a knacker's yard or into a swamp. Other, less common variants of the legend include getting lost after the seed of the Irrkraut, called Irrsame (""astray seed""), fell inside one's shoes, or not finding home after eating some Irrwurzel. In Switzerland, where this plant is known as Vexierchrut (""vexing herb"") and identified with fern, one goes astray when carrying some of it in one's pocket. In Thuringia, where the Irrkraut fern is also known as Otterkraut or Atterkreutich (both ""adder or viper herb""), it does not only lead people astray but also makes adders and vipers chase the person carrying the plant lest they throw it away. In Carinthia, getting lost after stepping on a Irrwurzen is attributed to a spirit or goblin standing in front of the right path and 'veneering' (i.e. hiding) it.

Remedies
There are some remedies known which are of help after getting lost. As such, the plant's magic can be staved off by taking off one's shoes or specifically switching them (right to left and left to right). Women might also take off their apron and tie it on again inside out. Both methods can be used not only to end the magic but also to prevent it from happening in the first place. In Tyrol, though, one has to go astray until another steps on the Irrwurzel.

Extinction
In the Ziller Valley in Tyrol, the last Irrwurz is said to have been burned in 1803 by an oil merchant who owned it. He did it after being told so by the cleric who came to him when he lay on his deathbed.

In the US
The German ancestors of the Pennsylvania Dutch brought the mythological idea of Irrkraut to the New World, calling it Verirrgraut (""going astray herb"") in their dialect  and identifying it with the rattlesnake plantain. When stepping on it at night, the victim is said to wander around aimlessly until morning comes. If stepping on it at day, the victim has to be shocked back to reason or else it won't stop wandering around aimlessly. Pennsylvania Dutch remedies against going astray are walking barefoot or switching shoes.

The French herbe d'égarement
Name varieties
The herbe d'égarement is known under a plethora of names through all of France. It is called herbe qui égare (""herb which leads astray"") in Normandy and in Meudon near Paris. In Besançon, its name is herbe à la recule (""herb to move backwards""). In the 18th century it was also called herbe de fourvoiement (""herb of going astray""). In Normandy it is further called egaire, in Saintogne herbe maudite (""herb of the damned soul"") or herbe des tournes (""herb of turns""), in Anjou herbe à adirer (""herb to get lost""). In Upper Brittany and Lorraine it is known as herbe d'oubli (""herb of oblivion""). In Lower Brittany it is simply known as l'herbe, or ar Iotan in Breton (both ""the herb"").

Traits and remedies
The herbe d'égarement is a plant of unknown appearance which makes those who step on it lose their sense of direction or retrace their own steps. In Franche-Comté, it is also said that the plantain makes people go astray. In Burgundy, whoever stepps on the so-called tourmentine growing in the forest will walk the same path a hundred times over without being able to recognize it lest he finds the herb Paris whose seeds show where the path continues when they fall. The Breton ar Iotan is inhabited by a spirit which makes people lose their way. At night it spreads a phosphorescent light like that of certain glowworms. Its spell can be broken by turning one's clothing inside out, though. In Léon in Brittany, where it is known as herbe qui trouble la vue (""herb which troubles the sight""), one switches one's clogs as a remedy. Around Moncontour in Brittany, the herbe d'oubli further has the power to make people understand the language of animals but only as long as the one who has touched or taken it isn't aware that the plant in question is in fact the herbe d'oubli.

Origin of the legend
Mother Leeds's 13th child
The popular legend of the Jersey Devil or Leeds Devil is dated variously, and attached to various place names such as ""The Pines"" Pine Barrens, and Leeds Point. The devil's mother is sometimes called a woman named Leeds, or ""Mother Leeds"" of Burlington, but other names such as the Shourds  have been forwarded.
According to one précis, in 1735, a woman named Leeds was giving birth to her thirteenth child and exclaimed ""let the child be the devil!"". The child, though born normally. immediately grew wings, tail, and claws and flew out to the Pine Barrens.
According to some the child transformed into a creature with hooves, a goat's head, bat wings, and a forked tail. Growling and screaming, the child beat everyone with its tail before flying up the chimney and heading into the pines. In some versions of the tale, Mother Leeds was supposedly a witch and the child's father was the devil himself. Some versions of the legend also state that local clergymen subsequently attempted to exorcise the creature from the Pine Barrens.
In a different telling, localized not at Leeds Point but at Esteville, near Mays Landing, a Mrs. Leeds became pregnant around 1855 and rejected her baby, wishing a stork would deliver a devil. Thus a winged devil was born and flew out the window; it would intermittently return but the mother would shoo it away.

The Leeds family
Prior to the early 1900s, the Jersey Devil was referred to as the Leeds Devil or the Devil of Leeds, either in connection with the local Leeds family or the eponymous Leeds Point in South Jersey.
""Mother Leeds"" has been identified by some as the real-life Deborah Leeds, on grounds that Deborah Leeds' husband, Japhet Leeds, named twelve children in the will he wrote during 1736, which is compatible with the legend. Deborah and Japhet Leeds also lived in the Leeds Point section of what is now Atlantic County, New Jersey, which is commonly the location of the Jersey Devil story.
Brian Regal, a historian of science at Kean University, theorizes that the story of Mother Leeds, rather than being based on a single historical person alone, originated from the reputation of the local prominent Leeds family in the southern portion of the colonial-era Province of New Jersey, where religious-political disputes became the subject of folklore and gossip among the local population. Regal contends that folk legends concerning these historical disputes evolved through the years and ultimately resulted in the modern popular legend of the Jersey Devil during the early 20th century. Regal contends that ""colonial-era political intrigue"" involving early New Jersey politicians, Benjamin Franklin, and Franklin's rival almanac publisher Daniel Leeds (1651–1720) resulted in the Leeds family being described as ""monsters"", and it was Daniel Leeds' negative description as the ""Leeds Devil"", rather than any actual creature, that created the later legend of the Jersey Devil.
Much like the Mother Leeds of the Jersey Devil myth, Daniel Leeds' third wife had given birth to nine children, a large number of children even for the time. Leeds' second wife and first daughter had both died during childbirth. Leeds and his family were prominent in the South Jersey and Pine Barrens area. As a royal surveyor with strong allegiance to the British crown, Leeds had surveyed and acquired land in the Egg Harbor area, located within the Pine Barrens. The land was inherited by Leeds' sons and family and is now known as Leeds Point, one of the areas in the Pine Barrens currently most associated with the Jersey Devil legend and alleged Jersey Devil sightings.
Starting in the 17th century, English Quakers established settlements in Southern Jersey, the region in which the Pine Barrens are located. Daniel Leeds, a Quaker and a prominent person of pre-Revolution colonial southern New Jersey, became ostracized by his Quaker congregation after his 1687 publication of almanacs containing astrological symbols and writings. Leeds' fellow Quakers deemed the astrology in these almanacs as too ""pagan"" or blasphemous, and the almanacs were censored and destroyed by the local Quaker community.
In response to and in spite of this censorship, Leeds continued to publish even more esoteric astrological Christian writings and became increasingly fascinated with Christian occultism, Christian mysticism, cosmology, demonology and angelology, and natural magic. In the 1690s, after his almanacs and writings were further censored as blasphemous or heretical by the Philadelphia Quaker Meeting, Leeds continued to dispute with the Quaker community, converting to Anglicanism and publishing anti-Quaker tracts criticizing Quaker theology and accusing Quakers of being anti-monarchists. In the ensuing dispute between Leeds and the southern New Jersey Quakers over Leeds' accusations, Leeds was endorsed by the much-maligned British royal governor of New Jersey, Lord Cornbury, despised among the Quaker communities. Leeds also worked as a councilor to Lord Cornbury about this time. Considering Leeds as a traitor for aiding the Crown and rejecting Quaker beliefs, the Quaker Burlington Meeting of southern New Jersey subsequently dismissed Leeds as ""evil"". In 1700, the local South Jersey Quaker community retaliated against Leeds’ anti-Quaker tracts with their own tract, Satan’s Harbinger Encountered … Being Something by Way of Answer to Daniel Leeds,  which publicly
accused Leeds of working for the devil.
In 1716, Daniel Leeds' son, Titan Leeds, inherited his father's almanac business, which continued to use astrological content and eventually competed with Benjamin Franklin's popular Poor Richard's Almanack. The competition between the two men intensified when, in 1733, Franklin satirically used astrology in his almanac to predict Titan Leeds' death on October of that same year. Though Franklin's prediction was intended as a joke at his competitor's expense and a means to boost almanac sales, Titan Leeds was apparently offended at the death prediction, publishing a public admonition of Franklin as a ""fool"" and a ""liar"". In a published response, Franklin mocked Titan Leeds' outrage and humorously suggested that, in fact, Titan Leeds had died in accordance with the earlier prediction and was thus writing his almanacs as a ghost, resurrected from the grave to haunt and torment Franklin. Franklin continued to jokingly refer to Titan Leeds as a ""ghost"" even after Titan Leeds' actual death in 1738. Daniel Leeds' blasphemous and occultist reputation and his pro-monarchy stance in the largely anti-monarchist colonial south of New Jersey, combined with Benjamin Franklin's later continuous depiction of his son Titan Leeds as a ghost, may have originated or contributed to the local folk legend of a so-called ""Leeds Devil"" lurking in the Pine Barrens.
During 1728, Titan Leeds began to include the Leeds family crest on the masthead of his almanacs. The Leeds family crest depicted a wyvern, a bat-winged dragon-like legendary creature that stands upright on two clawed feet. Regal notes that the wyvern on the Leeds family crest is reminiscent of the popular descriptions of the Jersey Devil. The inclusion of this family crest on Leeds' almanacs may have further contributed to the Leeds family's poor reputation among locals and possibly influenced the popular descriptions of the Leeds Devil or Jersey Devil. The fearsome appearance of the crest's wyvern and the increasing animosity among local South Jersey residents towards royalty, aristocracy, and nobility (with whom family crests were associated) may have helped facilitate the legend of the Leeds Devil and the association of the Leeds family with ""devils"" and ""monsters"".

The Leeds Devil
Regal notes that, by the late 18th century and the early 19th century at the latest, the ""Leeds Devil"" had become an ubiquitous legendary monster or ghost story in present-day South Jersey. In the early to mid-19th century, stories continued to circulate in southern New Jersey of the Leeds Devil, a ""monster wandering the Pine Barrens."" An oral tradition of ""Leeds Devil"" monster/ghost stories became well-established in the Pine Barrens area.
Although the ""Leeds Devil"" legend has existed since the 18th century, Regal states that the more modern depiction of the Jersey Devil, as well as the now pervasive ""Jersey Devil"" name, first became truly standardized in current form during the early 20th century:

During the pre-Revolutionary period, the Leeds family, who called the Pine Barrens home, soured its relationship with the Quaker majority ... The Quakers saw no hurry to give their former fellow religionist an easy time in circles of gossip. His wives had all died, as had several children. His son Titan stood accused by Benjamin Franklin of being a ghost ... The family crest had winged dragons on it. In a time when thoughts of independence were being born, these issues made the Leeds family political and religious monsters. From all this over time the legend of the Leeds Devil was born. References to the 'Jersey Devil' do not appear in newspapers or other printed material until the twentieth century. The first major flap came in 1909. It is from these sightings that the popular image of the creature—batlike wings, horse head, claws, and general air of a dragon—became standardized.

Indeed, many references to a ""Leeds Devil"" or ""Devil of Leeds"" appear in earlier printed material prior to the widespread usage of the ""Jersey Devil"" name. During 1859, the Atlantic Monthly published an article detailing the Leeds Devil folk tales popular among Pine Barren residents (or ""pine rats"".) A newspaper from 1887 describes sightings of a winged creature, referred to as ""the Devil of Leeds"", allegedly spotted near the Pine Barrens and well known among the local populace of Burlington County, New Jersey:

Whenever he went near it, it would give a most unearthly yell that frightened the dogs. It whipped at every dog on the place. ""That thing,"" said the colonel, ""is not a bird nor an animal, but it is the Leeds devil, according to the description, and it was born over in Evesham, Burlington County, a hundred years ago. There is no mistake about it. I never saw the horrible critter myself, but I can remember well when it was roaming around in Evesham woods fifty years ago, and when it was hunted by men and dogs and shot at by the best marksmen there were in all South Jersey but could not be killed. There isn't a family in Burlington or any of the adjoining counties that does not know of the Leeds devil, and it was the bugaboo to frighten children with when I was a boy.

Reported sightings
There have been many claims of sightings and occurrences involving the Jersey Devil.
According to legend, while visiting the Hanover Mill Works to inspect his cannonballs being forged, Commodore Stephen Decatur sighted a flying creature and fired a cannonball directly upon it, to no effect.
Joseph Bonaparte, elder brother of Napoleon, is also claimed to have seen the Jersey Devil while hunting on his Bordentown estate about 1820.
During 1840, the Jersey Devil was blamed for several livestock killings. Similar attacks were reported during 1841, accompanied by tracks and screams.
In Greenwich Township, in December 1925, a local farmer shot an unidentified animal as it attempted to steal his chickens, and then photographed the corpse. Afterward, he claimed that none of 100 people he showed it to could identify it. On July 27, 1937, an unknown animal ""with red eyes"" seen by residents of Downingtown, Pennsylvania was compared to the Jersey Devil by a reporter for the Pennsylvania Bulletin of July 28, 1937. In 1951, a group of Gibbstown, New Jersey boys claimed to have seen a 'monster' matching the Devil's description and claims of a corpse matching the Jersey Devil's description arose in 1957. During 1960, tracks and noises heard near Mays Landing were claimed to be from the Jersey Devil. During the same year the merchants around Camden offered a $10,000 reward for the capture of the Jersey Devil, even offering to build a private zoo to house the creature if it was captured.

Wave of sightings in 1909
During the week of January 16–23, 1909, newspapers published hundreds of claimed encounters with the Jersey Devil from all over South Jersey and the Philadelphia area. Among these alleged encounters were claims the creature ""attacked"" a trolley car in Haddon Heights and a social club in Camden. Police in Camden and Bristol, Pennsylvania supposedly fired on the creature to no effect. Other reports initially concerned unidentified footprints in the snow, but soon sightings of creatures resembling the Jersey Devil were being reported throughout South Jersey and as far away as Delaware and western Maryland. The widespread newspaper coverage created fear throughout the Delaware Valley prompting a number of schools to close and workers to stay home. Vigilante groups and groups of hunters roamed the pines and countrysides in search of the devil. During this period, it is rumored that the Philadelphia Zoo posted a $10,000 reward for the creature. The offer prompted a variety of hoaxes, including a kangaroo equipped with artificial claws and bat wings.

Description and explanation
Skeptics believe the Jersey Devil to be nothing more than a creative manifestation upon the imaginations of the early English settlers in South Jersey, with plausible natural explanations including: bogeyman stories created and told by bored Pine Barren residents as a form of children's entertainment; the byproduct of the historical local disdain for the Leeds family; the misidentification of known animals; and rumors based on common negative perceptions of the local rural population of the Pine Barren (known as ""pineys"").
The frightening reputation of the Pine Barrens may indeed have contributed to the Jersey Devil legend. Historically, the Pine Barrens was considered inhospitable land. Gangs of highwaymen, such as the politically disdained Loyalist brigands, known as the Pine Robbers, were known to rob and attack travelers passing through the Barrens. During the 18th century and the 19th century, residents of the isolated Pine Barrens were deemed the dregs or outcasts of society: poor farmers, fugitives, brigands, Native Americans, poachers, moonshiners, runaway slaves, and deserting soldiers. So-called pineys have sometimes fostered certain frightening stories about themselves and the Pine Barrens to discourage outsiders or intruders from entering the Barrens. Pineys were further demonized and vilified after two eugenics studies were published during the early 20th century, which depicted pineys as congenital idiots and criminals, as seen in the research performed on ""The Kallikak Family"" by Henry H. Goddard, which is now considered biased,  inaccurate, unscientific, and, most likely, falsified.
Due in part to their isolated and undeveloped nature, the Pine Barrens have themselves fostered various folk legends. Apart from the Jersey Devil, many other legends are associated with the Pine Barrens; supernatural creatures and ghosts said to haunt the pine forests include the ghost of the pirate Captain Kidd, who supposedly buried treasure in the Pine Barrens and is sometimes allegedly seen in the company of the Jersey Devil; the ghost of the Black Doctor, the benevolent spirit of an African-American doctor who, after being forbidden from practicing medicine due to his race, entered the Pine Barrens to practice medicine in the isolated communities of the Barrens and is said to still come to the aid of lost or injured travelers; the ghost of the Black Dog, which, unlike many black dog legends, is usually portrayed as harmless; the ghost of the Golden-Haired Girl, the spirit of a girl who is said to be staring out into the sea, dressed in white, mourning the loss of her lover at sea; and the White Stag, a ghostly white deer said to rescue travelers in the Barrens from danger. There are also folk tales concerning the Blue Hole, an unusually clear blue and rounded body of water located in the Pine Barrens between Monroe Township, Gloucester County and Winslow Township, Camden County and often associated with the Jersey Devil.
Jeff Brunner of the Humane Society of New Jersey thinks that “vagrant” sandhill cranes  are partially the basis of the Jersey Devil stories, adding, ""There are no photographs, no bones, no hard evidence whatsoever, and worst of all, no explanation of its origins that doesn't require belief in the supernatural."" Sandhill cranes are not indigenous or well-known to South Jersey, are approximately the same size as the alleged Jersey Devil, and produce distinctive loud vocalizations; as unfamiliar animals with a distinctively loud, trumpeting call, wayward or vagrant migrating Sandhill cranes that ended up in South Jersey would thus potentially startle or frighten Pine Barren residents at night or under other circumstances in which the animal’s true appearance was unclear. 
Outdoorsman and author Tom Brown Jr. spent several seasons living in the wilderness of the Pine Barrens. He recounts occasions when terrified hikers mistook him for the Jersey Devil, after he covered his whole body with mud to repel mosquitoes.
Medical sociologist Robert E. Bartholomew and author Peter Hassall cite the infamous 1909 series of sightings of the Jersey Devil (and the subsequent public panic) as a classic example of mass hysteria begun by a regional urban legend.
One New Jersey group called the ""Devil Hunters"" refer to themselves as ""official researchers of the Jersey Devil"", and devote time to collecting reports, visiting historic sites, and going on nocturnal hunts in the Pine Barrens in order to ""find proof that the Jersey Devil does in fact exist.""
Writing in Jan Harold Brunvand's American Folklore: An Encyclopedia, Rutgers Professor Angus Kress Gillespie called the Jersey Devil ""an obscure regional legend"" for most of its existence, and said that ""after more than 250 years in oral circulation, the legend of the 'Jersey Devil' has many variations ..."". Gillespie cites the Devil's image used on T-shirts, buttons, and postcards, and cocktails named after the Devil, as indications that ""the recent history of the Jersey Devil is more in the realm of popular culture than folklore"".
Writer Dan Evon noticed some similarities between the Jersey Devil and an existing megabat species found in Africa, Hypsignathus monstrosus.

Hoaxes
Gordon Stein in Encyclopedia of Hoaxes (1993) noted that the alleged footprints of the Jersey Devil during 1909 resembled a horse's hoof. According to Stein, a man later admitted he had faked some of these footprints.
Geoff Tibballs in The World's Greatest Hoaxes (2006) has claimed that Norman Jeffries was involved in hoaxing the Jersey Devil:

Norman Jeffries, publicist for Philadelphia's Arch Street Museum and renowned hoaxer, was well aware of the stories about the Jersey Devil. So when the museum proprietor, T. F. Hopkins, admitted that it was in danger of closure unless Jeffries came up with something to boost attendances, the publicist decided that a captive Jersey Devil would be the ideal crowd-puller.
He also planted nonfictional newspaper stories about new sightings of the Devil. During 1909, Jeffries with his friend Jacob Hope, an animal trainer, purchased a kangaroo from a circus and glued artificial claws and bat wings onto it. They declared to the public they had captured the Devil and it was displayed at the museum. Twenty years later, Jeffries admitted to the hoax.

Cultural relevance
In Man and Beast in American Comic Legend, folklorist Richard Dorson outlines six criteria for establishing distinction among legendary creatures of American folklore. While the Jersey Devil was not expressly cited by Dorson, it nevertheless qualifies for this same level of relevance. Dorson specifies that the qualifier must: exist in oral tradition, inspire belief and conviction, become personalized and institutionalized, be fanciful or mythical , and contain a ""comical side,"" which endears it to the American public.
Oral tradition of the Jersey Devil well predates printed newspaper accounts, and belief in its existence by many continues. The latter is made evident not only by commentators who elaborate on this possibility but also by investigative programs such as Mother Leeds' 13th Child, In Search of Monsters, Lore and Monsters and Mysteries in America.
As a fixture of organizations, it is the namesake for two professional ice hockey teams. The first, the Jersey Devils of the Eastern Hockey League, played from 1964 until the league folded in 1973. The second, the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League, have played since 1982. The current team was formerly known as the Colorado Rockies, and their name was chosen by a poll shortly after the team relocated to New Jersey. This same trend towards cultural incorporation is further exemplified by the Jersey Devil's appropriation in toy lines, such as its inclusion as a vinyl figure in Cryptozoic Entertainment Cryptkins blind box, as well as its application as a motif by Six Flags Great Adventure for their Jersey Devil Coaster developed by Rocky Mountain Construction.
Moreover, the Jersey Devil's fanciful or mythical nature is explored in the numerous works of fantasy it makes an appearance in, including: The X-Files, Jersey Devil (video game), The Wolf Among Us, 13th Child, TMNT, The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest, The Barrens, Carny, Poptropica, A Night With The Jersey Devil, The Last Broadcast, Legend Quest, What We Do in the Shadows, Gravity Falls, Fallout 76, Inscryption, Extreme Ghostbusters and Supernatural; many of which, such as TMNT and Jersey Devil (video game), not only reflect the Jersey Devil's mythical character but exemplify its comical nature as well.

It wears a tiny version of standard miner's garb and commits random mischief, such as stealing miners' unattended tools and food.

Cornish folklore
Cornish miners believed that the diminutive Knockers beckoned them toward finding rich veins of tin. As miners changed from independent, family-owned operators to hired laborers for large industrialized companies, there was an increased concern for safety, reflected in the knockers new role. They knocked on the mine walls to warn of impending collapse.
Generally considered benevolent, they were also tricksters who would hide tools and extinguish candles. They are similar to the coblynau of Welsh miners.
One interpretation holds that they are mine-spirits, believed to be the ghosts of the Jews who worked the mines in the 11th and 12th centuries; another view is that they are the spirits of those killed in a mine. To show appreciation, and to avoid future peril, the miners cast the last bite of their tasty pasties into the mines for the Knockers.

In the United States
In the 1820s, immigrant Welsh and Cornish miners brought tales of the Tommyknockers and their theft of unwatched items and warning knocks to western Pennsylvania. Cornish miners, much sought after in the years following the gold and silver rushes, brought them to Colorado, Nevada, and California. The underground elves became part of the folklore of miners throughout the American West, not just those of Cornish background.
When asked if they had relatives who would come to work the mines, the Cornish miners always said something along the lines of ""Well, me cousin Jack over in Cornwall wouldst come, could ye pay 'is boat ride"", and so these immigrant miners came to be called Cousin Jacks.  The Cousin Jacks  refused to enter new mines until assured by the management that the knockers were already on duty. Even non-Cornish miners, who worked deep in the earth where the noisy support timbers creaked and groaned, came to respect the Tommyknockers. The American interpretation of knockers seemed to be more ghostly than elfish.
Belief in the knockers in America remained well into the 20th century.  When one large mine closed in 1956 and the owners sealed the entrance, fourth, fifth, and sixth generation Cousin Jacks circulated a petition calling on the mineowners to set the knockers free so that they could move on to other mines. The owners complied.  Belief among Nevadan miners persisted amongst its miners as late as the 1930s.
Tommyknocker Brewery in Idaho Springs, Colorado owes its namesake to the mythical creature, and began serving in 1994 to meet the needs of the large number of prospectors, as part of the Colorado Silver Boom.
Knocker also appeared as a name for the same phenomena, in the folklore of Staffordshire miners.

In literature
Knockers are a motif found in the science fiction/horror book The Tommyknockers by Stephen King.
Tommyknockers are also mentioned in the Hardy Boys book, Hunting for Hidden Gold. ""Tommy-clockers"" is the title of chapter eight.
A benevolent knocker appears in The Ironwood Tree, the fourth book in The Spiderwick Chronicles, in which it helps the protagonists escape from a dwarf kingdom.
In the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Angle of Repose by Wallace Stegner, protagonist Susan Burling Ward first hears about tommyknockers when her husband and his colleagues take her into one of the quicksilver mines at New Almaden.

The creature is often described as a ""part-man, part-goat"" with scales and long clawed fingers.

History
Reports of sightings by local citizens of ""a half-man, half-goat, with fur and scales"" in July 1969 led to the belief that a mysterious creature lived in Lake Worth. Newspapers reported the alleged sightings, including one in which the monster landed on a man's car after jumping out of a tree, and another in which it threw an automobile tire at a group of people. Newspapers also published a photograph purportedly taken of the creature by Allen Plaster, and locals began driving out to the lake at night to get a look at it. Local police investigated the claims, but found no evidence of the monster in the Lake Worth and Greer Island area. According to one reporter, the Goatman legend was spread via summer camp stories, where camp counselors told children to “listen carefully...and you’ll hear his cry on clear nights like tonight”.
In a later interview, Allen Plaster commented on the photo, described as a man-sized ""white furball"", that he took while driving past the Nature Center in 1969. He said he believed that the sighting was a prank, stating “whatever it was, it wanted to be seen"". Since reports of the monster ceased when school resumed, many suspected the incidents were pranks carried out by high school students. In 2005, a reporter at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram received an anonymous letter from someone claiming to be one of three high school classmates who, in the summer of 1969, ""decided to go out to Lake Worth and scare people"" using a tinfoil mask. In 2009, Fort Worth, Texas magazine published a report about an unidentified man who claimed that he had been a perpetrator of the tire-throwing incident.
Cryptozoologist-blogger Craig Woolheater said he believes the Lake Worth monster is an ""undiscovered, uncataloged primate species that walks on two legs"".

Popular culture
Since 2009 (the 40th anniversary of the sightings), the Fort Worth Nature Center and Refuge has held a Lake Worth Monster Bash each October. In 2019, the Fort Worth Water Department's H2OMG Podcast released a four part audio series on the legend of the Lake Worth Monster.

It was once thought to be a separate species. However, scientists who examined the specimens determined that the animals were stunted due to the harsh environment in which they lived. Today, it is acknowledged that lava bears never existed as a unique species.

Description
When lava bears were first encountered in the early 20th century it was speculated that they might be a unique species, possibly a dwarf grizzly. The diminutive bears resembled black bears in many ways, but were much smaller with wooly fur that was light brown in color, similar to grizzly bears. Specimens taken by hunters were a little larger than a badger. They were approximately 17 inches (43 cm) to 30 inches (76 cm) long and between 12 inches (30 cm) and 18 inches (46 cm) high. The bears weighed between 23 pounds (10 kg) and 35 pounds (16 kg). Gray hair on their muzzles along with well-worn claws and teeth indicated that some of the specimens were adult bears.
One of the first lava bear specimens taken in the wild was mounted and sent to United States Bureau of Biological Survey in Washington, District of Columbia. Eventually, scientists determined that lava bears were American black bears (Ursus americanus) stunted by malnutrition caused by the austere environment where the animals lived and foraged.

History
From 1917 through the early 1930s, a number of people reported seeing small bears in the lava beds and surrounding high desert county of northern Lake County, Oregon. The bears were initially called sand lappers, but eventually became known as lava bears. The first documented encounter was in 1917, when a sheepherder name O. T. McKendree killed a small bear near Fossil Lake. Originally, McKendree thought it was a black bear cub, but upon further inspection he found the animal was a very small adult bear. He had the animal mounted by a taxidermist. The mounted lava bear was exhibited in The Dalles and later in Lakeview. A photograph of the mounted bear was published in Oregon Sportsman magazine in October 1917. Eventually, the mounted specimen was sent to Washington, D. C., where it was examined by Clinton Hart Merriam of the Bureau of Biological Survey. Merriam, an expert on North American bears, determined that the specimen was an unusually small American black bear.
Publicity generated by the Oregon Sportsman photograph and various newspaper articles about the miniature bear made it a fascinating creature. In 1920, Irvin S. Cobb, a well-known writer for The Saturday Evening Post, organized a hunting trip to Oregon with the stated purpose of finding a lava bear. While Cobb did not locate a lava bear during his hunt, he left Oregon believing they existed. He thought the little bears were a dwarf grizzly or a species of sun bear, unique to North America. After he left Oregon, several of the local trappers who accompanied Cobb began to actively search for lava bears. In addition, the story Cobb wrote about his hunting trip for The Saturday Evening Post increased interest in the animal across the county.
In 1923, Alfred Andrews, a trapper for the United States Forest Service, reported killing a lava bear near Fort Rock. He sent the specimen to the Oregon biological survey office for examination. A year later, Andrews captured a live lava bear. The animal looked like a small grizzly bear, but weighed only 28 pounds (13 kg). It was a male, 30 inches (76 cm) long and 18 inches (46 cm) high. The Smithsonian offered Andrews $2,000 for the live lava bear, but he decided not to sell the animal. Instead, he announced plans to tour the country with the bear. He displayed the bear in Portland, where 8,000 people paid to see the animal. It was also exhibited in Bend and Klamath Falls before being taken to Los Angeles, California. Eventually, Andrews' partner Harry Thrall stole or sold the bear and the animal disappeared.
In the fall of 1924, a second lava bear was captured alive near Summer Lake. That bear weighed only 25 pounds (11 kg).  Another lava bear was trapped by L. E. Oster in the lava beds northeast of Fort Rock in 1933. A fourth lava bear was taken alive the following year by Walter Gore and Roy Yeager in an area east of Crescent Lake. It weighed 30 pounds (14 kg) and resembled a miniature grizzly. The last animal identified as a lava bear was captured in 1934 by a forest road crew near Scar Mountain in the Willamette National Forest. It was 17 inches (43 cm) long and weighed 25 pounds (11 kg). It was exhibited for a time in McKenzie Bridge, Oregon before the animal was sold to a man named Alfred Bayne. As late as 1981, scientist were being asked to identify small bear tracks in the Fort Rock area to determine if they were made by lava bears.
Today, it is accepted that lava bears are actually common American black bears. It is also generally acknowledged that all of the animals that were killed or captured between 1917 and 1934 were either black bear cubs or small adults stunted from malnutrition.

Popular culture
In 1924, Bend Senior High School selected the lava bear as the school's sports mascot. The mascot was chosen shortly after a living bear was exhibited in Bend. At the time, it was thought that lava bears might be a species unique to Central Oregon. In 2013, The Oregonian newspaper conducted a statewide survey, asking Oregon sports fans to identify their favorite high school team mascots. Fans from across the state of Oregon, selected Bend's Lava Bear as their top pick for large school mascot.

The Jersey Devil
The Jersey Devil is a common element of folklore in the southern New Jersey and Philadelphia areas. Due to the number of alleged sightings, many believe the Devil to be an actual animal or phenomenon similar to Bigfoot and the Yeti. Believers sometimes cite the widespread sightings by crowds of people during the ""phenomenal week of 1909"" as substantial evidence of some kind of occurrence. It is also held by some that the vastness and remote nature of the Pine Barrens could allow a species to remain hidden over time. Though there are indeed firm believers in the Jersey Devil (or believers that hold that the Jersey Devil sightings are the result of another animal, such as a sandhill crane or kangaroo), there are some legendary creatures in the Pine Barrens that most residents unquestionably consider legends.

Captain Kidd
Pinelands folklore often mixes the legend of the ghost of Captain Kidd with that of the Jersey Devil. According to locals, New Jersey's Barnegat Bay is one of the resting places of the notorious Kidd's many treasures. During the 17th and 18th centuries, some locals told stories of the ghost of Kidd walking along the beach with the Jersey Devil. In these reports, Kidd is often headless.

The Black Dog
The Black Dog is a ghostly creature said to roam the beaches and forests from Absecon Island to Barnegat Bay. In most folklore (such as English and Germanic folklore), black dog ghosts are malevolent or considered forces of evil. However, the Black Dog of the Pine Barrens is often considered a harmless spirit. According to folklore, pirates on Absecon Island attacked a ship and killed its crew. Among those killed were the cabin boy and his black dog.

The Golden-Haired Girl
The Golden-Haired Girl is a ghost said to stare out into the sea, dressed in white, mourning the loss of her lover at sea. The Jersey Devil is sometimes said to sit alongside her, accompanying her on her vigil. Another legend says the Jersey Devil had a son, strangely human, who fell in love with a rich girl. However, her family did not agree with this. They took her away and she killed herself upon reaching the destination. Heartbroken, he became the next generation. Now her ghost follows him.

The Black Doctor
The Black Doctor is the ghost of an African American man known as James Still. According to legend, in the 19th century, James was not permitted to practice medicine because of his race. Undiscouraged, however, James went into seclusion in the Pine Barrens to study medicine from his textbooks (in some variations, James also learns herbal remedies from the local Indigenous people). There are different versions of his death. Some say that he was unjustly lynched when local pineys found out that he was studying medicine. Others stories state that he was a hero to the piney community and died of a heart attack. The ghost is said to come to the aid of injured or stranded travelers in the Pine Barrens.
In fact, Dr. James Still was the brother of William Still, a noted abolitionist who wrote the book The Underground Railroad. Dr. Still wrote a book titled Early Recollections: The Life of Dr. James Still. He had an office in Medford, and was the third-largest landowner in town. He was self-taught in the manners of medical botany and used many herbal remedies for cures.

The White Stag
The White Stag is a ghostly white deer said to aid travelers lost in the Pine Barrens. The Stag also prevents impending disasters, and is said to have stopped a stagecoach from crashing into the Batsto River. The near ""disaster"" in question occurred at Quaker Bridge when the horses of a stage refused to go any further. When the driver climbed off the stage, he noticed a white stag in the road which then disappeared. Walking up the road, he saw that the bridge was out. According to the legend, if you see a white stag, it is supposed to be good luck.

Researcher Ben Radford states that this is a compelling story, ""but several important aspects wither under skeptical scrutiny.""

History
On July 14, 1988, the Lee County sheriff's office investigated a report of a car damaged overnight while parked at a home in the area of Browntown outside Bishopville, South Carolina, on the edges of the Scape Ore Swamp. The car reportedly had toothmarks and scratches with hair and muddy footprints left behind. Sheriff Liston Truesdale noted this was the start of various claims that eventually coalesced into a story about a lizard man in the swamp. Prompted by the news of the vehicle damage, 17-year-old local Christopher Davis reported to the sheriff that his car was damaged by a creature he described as ""green, wetlike, about 7 feet (2.1 m) tall and had three fingers, red eyes, skin like a lizard, snakelike scales"" two weeks prior. According to Davis, he was driving home from working the night shift at a fast food restaurant when his car got a flat tire. After fixing it, he saw a creature walking toward him. Davis got in his car and began to drive, but the creature was soon on top of the car. He applied his brakes, causing the creature to roll off the car, giving Davis enough time to escape. Coverage by newspapers and media resulted in increased attention for his claims. Local businesses began selling ""Lizard Man"" T-shirts, and the local chamber of commerce encouraged the media attention as ""good for the community"".
The increase in newspaper and media publicity prompted further reports of sightings, and the area soon became a tourist attraction for visitors and hunters. Local radio station WCOS offered a $1 million reward to anybody who could capture the creature alive. On August 5, Kenneth Orr, an airman stationed at Shaw Air Force Base, filed a police report alleging that he had encountered the Lizard Man on Highway 15, and he had shot and wounded it. He presented several scales and a small quantity of blood as evidence. Orr recanted this account two days later when he was arraigned for unlawfully carrying a pistol and the misdemeanor offense of filing a false police report. According to Orr, he had hoaxed the sighting in order to keep stories about the Lizard Man in circulation. Reports of the creature gradually declined at the end of the summer. Local law enforcement officials speculated that the sightings were likely to have been a bear.
In 2008, CNN mentioned the Lizard Man legend in a story about a couple in Bishopville who reported damage to their vehicle, including blood traces. The blood traces were subsequently found to be from a domestic dog, though the local sheriff suggested it might have been a coyote or wolf. In 2015, local television station WCIV featured photos and videos claimed to be Lizard Man, allegedly taken by Jim Wilson and other unidentified individuals. In August 2017, the South Carolina Emergency Management Division sent a humorous tweet ""regarding possible paranormal activity"" during the solar eclipse that passed over the area, hinting that people of Lee and Sumter counties should ""remain vigilant"" for sightings of the Lizard Man.

Criticism
Skeptical investigator Ben Radford states that the details of Chris Davis's story do not hold up under scrutiny. Sheriff Truesdale stated that Davis's story never wavered, but Radford writes that isn't true.
Over weeks and months and repeated tellings, the details changed many times, from having scales to the ""creature being packed with mud"", how far away Davis was from the creature when he first saw it, and whether or not it attacked the car. Radford questioned how Davis was able to see details of the Lizard Man creature at 2 am when there was no lighting nearby in a heavily wooded area when the moon was not bright. If this was an aggressive creature, why were there no other credible sightings? According to Radford, the timing of Davis' story didn't make sense. If Davis saw the creature in the shadows while he was closing the trunk of his car, Davis still had to get back in the car and take off, yet Davis claims that the creature was so fast that it caught up to the car when he was doing 40 mph (64 km/h). Reports vary with the source that Davis told the police about the attack two or more weeks later.
After investigating, Radford states that the polygraph test administered to Davis may have been a ""publicity stunt"" by Southern Marketing, Inc., a company ""arrange(ing) personal appearances FOR Davis"". Another curious issue was that there are no photographs of the damage to Davis's car which provide some evidence that something happened. Newspaper accounts give various descriptions of the damage to the car, and in one local newspaper Davis is quoted as saying ""he escaped with no more than a scratch on his fender"". Radford states that Davis's report ""is quite literally incredible, riddled with both implausibilities and impossibilities. It may be sincere or it may be a hoax, but in either event no hard evidence of the creature has been found.""
Investigator Alicia Lutz has suggested that what Davis saw that night was actually a local butterbean farmer, Lucious Elmore, who was guarding his shed that night after recent thefts. Elmore claimed he heard a car tire blow out and, thinking it was thieves, walked out to the road to confront them.  Elmore said when Davis saw him, he screamed and took off.

Media
In 2010, the TV program Destination Truth featured the legendary creature.  Children's books such as Maniacal Monsters and Bizarre Beasts include the monster in their bestiaries. Linda Godfrey's 2014 book American Monsters: A History of Monster Lore, Legends, and Sightings in America includes a chapter on the lizard man, and Cryptozoologist Lyle Blackburn's 2013 book Lizard Man: The True Story of the Bishopville Monster details the entire history of the creature. The lizard man has also appeared on the SYFY show Fact or Faked in an episode titled ""Reptile Rampage"".
The original contemporaneous story ran in more than 100 newspapers across the country.

University of Cincinnati folklore professor Edgar Slotkin compared the Loveland frog to Paul Bunyan, saying that stories about it have been passed down for ""several decades"" and that sighting reports seem to come in predictable cycles.

Legends
According to various legends, the creature was first sighted by a businessman or a traveling salesman driving along an unnamed road late at night in 1955, with some versions of the story specifying the month of May. In one story, the driver was heading out of the Branch Hill neighborhood when he spotted three figures standing on their hind legs along the side of the road, each 3 to 4 feet (0.91 to 1.22 m) in height, with leathery skin and frog faces. In other versions of the story, the creatures were spotted under or over a poorly lit bridge, and one held a wand over its head that fired a spray of sparks.

Loveland police reports
On March 3, 1972, at 1:00 am, Loveland police officer Ray Shockey was driving on Riverside Drive near the Totes boot factory and the Little Miami River when an unidentified animal scurried across the road in front of his vehicle. The animal was fully illuminated in his vehicle's headlights, and he described it as 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 m) long and about 50 to 75 pounds (25 to 35 kg), with leathery skin. He reported spotting the animal ""crouched like a frog"" before it momentarily stood erect to climb over the guardrail and back down towards the river.
Two weeks after the incident, a second Loveland police officer, Mark Matthews, reported seeing an unidentified animal crouched along the road in the same vicinity as Shockey's sighting. Matthews shot the animal, recovered the body, and put it in his trunk to show officer Shockey. According to Matthews, it was ""a large iguana about 3 or 3.5 feet [0.9 or 1.1 m] long"", and he didn't immediately recognize it because it was missing its tail. Matthews speculated the iguana had been someone's pet that ""either got loose or was released when it grew too large"". According to Matthews, Shockey was shown the dead iguana and confirmed it was the animal he had seen two weeks previously. Matthews recounted the incident to an author of a book about urban legends, but says the author ""omitted the part that confirmed that the creature was an iguana rather than a Frogman"". Mathews also recounted the frogman story in 2016 again on WCPO-TV.

In fiction
James Renner's science fiction/mystery novel The Man From Primrose Lane features a version of the Loveland frog.
In May 2014, the Loveland frog legend was made into a musical, titled Hot Damn! It's the Loveland Frog!. The musical premiered at the Art Academy of Cincinnati during the 2014 Cincinnati Fringe Festival.
In 2023, a horror found footage film directed by Anthony Cousins, Frogman, was released.

Commemorations
In 2023, the Loveland frog became the city's mascot. The frog, dressed as a ""frog prince"", debuted at the city's second annual Hearts Afire Weekend celebration and appears at other city events.

Different variations of the legend attribute different origins to the entities.

Legend in Michigan
The melon heads of Michigan are said to reside around Felt Mansion, although they have also been reportedly seen in southern forested areas of Ottawa County. According to one story, they were originally children with hydrocephalus who lived at the Junction Insane Asylum near Felt Mansion. The story explains that, after enduring physical and emotional abuse, they became feral and were released into the forests surrounding the asylum. The Allegan County Historical Society asserts that the asylum never existed, although it was at one point a prison; however, the story has been part of the local folklore for several decades. Laketown Township Manager Al Meshkin told the Holland Sentinel that he had heard the tales as a teenager, noting that his friends referred to the beings as ""wobbleheads"". Some versions of the legend say that the children once lived in the mansion itself but later retreated to a system of caverns (or caves in a nearby hill left over from an abandoned zoo). Some versions of this legend say that the children devised a plan to escape and kill the doctor that abused them. It is said that the children had no place to hide the body, so they cut it up in small pieces which they hid around the mansion. Rumors exist that teenagers who had broken into the mansion saw ghosts of the children and claimed to see shadows of the doctor's murder through the light coming from an open door. The legend has spread throughout the region, even becoming the subject of a 2011 film simply titled The Melonheads, which is based around the West Michigan legend.

Legend in Ohio
The melon head stories of Ohio are primarily associated with the Cleveland suburb of Kirtland in Lake County. According to local lore, the melon heads were originally orphans under the watch of a mysterious figure known as Dr. Crow (sometimes spelled Crowe, Krohe or Kroh or known as Dr. Melonhead). Crow is said to have performed unusual experiments on the children, who developed large, hairless heads and malformed bodies. Some accounts claim that the children were already suffering from hydrocephalus and that Crow injected even more fluid into their brains.
Eventually, the legend continues, the children killed Crow, burned the orphanage, and retreated to the surrounding forests and supposedly feed on babies. Legend holds that the melon heads may be sighted along Wisner Road in Kirtland and adjacent Chardon Township in Geauga County. The melon head legend has been popularized on the Internet, particularly on the websites Creepy Cleveland and DeadOhio, where users offer their own versions of the story. A movie, Legend of the Melonheads, released in 2010, is based on the Ohio legend and various other legends in the Kirtland area. In the 2018 horror anthology movie The Field Guide to Evil, featuring eight stories from cultures around the world, the contribution from the USA is a rendition of the Melonheads where a man's son is taken into the woods and turned into a Melonhead. The 2024 release The Melon Heads: House of Crow is based on the legend.
Research shows that Dr. Crow likely didn't exist.

Legend in Connecticut
Several variations of the Melon Head legend can be found throughout Southwest Connecticut, especially in Southern Litchfield County, central & eastern Fairfield County and western New Haven County, Connecticut. In Fairfield County and Litchfield County, many tales can be found in communities such as Newtown, New Milford, Trumbull, Shelton, Stratford, Monroe, Easton and Weston. In western and central New Haven County tales can be found in towns like Seymour, Oxford, Milford, and Southbury.
There are several primary Connecticut variations. According to one variation of the myth, Fairfield County was the location of an asylum for the criminally insane that burned down in the fall of 1960, resulting in the death of all of the staff and most of the patients with 10-20 inmates unaccounted for, supposedly having survived and escaped to the woods. The legend states that the melon heads' appearance is the result of them having resorted to cannibalism in order to survive the harsh winters of the region and to inbreeding, which in turn caused them to develop hydrocephalus. Some retellings of this version substitute the asylum or prison with places of business or camp grounds and the inmates/patients with employees, staff or camp-goers. Individual variations will modify what town these individuals were originally from and where they end up.
According to the second variation, the melon heads are descendants of a Colonial-era family from Shelton-Trumbull who were banished after accusations of witchcraft were made against them causing them to retreat to the woods. As with the first version of this legend, this variation attributes the appearance of the melon heads to inbreeding. Melon Heads allegedly prey upon humans who wander into their territory. Like the first version, individual retellings will modify what town the family was originally from and where they end up.

Dracula Drive
A number of Connecticut-based legends of the melon heads have one characteristic in common: the inclusion of a secluded, rustic or single-lane (usually) dirt road running through the melon heads' wooded territory. Many towns in Fairfield County and New Haven County have rural and forested sections, and it is not uncommon for these forests to have rural roads running through them. These roads at times are associated with the local variation of the Melon Head legend and are said to be part of the Melon Heads' territory.
In a number of towns such as Newtown, New Milford, Shelton, Trumbull and Monroe, several legends place the melon heads' territory around a mysterious and mythical street commonly referred to as Dracula Drive. None of the towns that have a melon head legend have roads designated as Dracula Drive. Depending on what version of the legend is told, one of several existing streets are mistakenly referred to or coincidentally coincide with the Dracula Drive mentioned in the melon head stories. For instance, some legends place the melon heads' territory in and around Saw Mill City Road in Shelton as Dracula Drive. Some other roads mistakenly referred to as Dracula Drive include:

Edmonds Road in Oxford.
Velvet Street in Trumbull and Monroe. (Runs between Tashua Road in Trumbull and Judd Road in Monroe near the Easton border.)
Zion Hill Rd in Milford.
The roads around Lake Mohegan in Fairfield.
Marginal Road in New Haven.
Jeremy Swamp Road in Southbury.
Paths/roads in and around Roosevelt Forest in Stratford.

Inspirations and origins
Characteristics of the legend evolve and parts of various versions of the legend affect other parts/versions of the legend. For example, some legends claim the melon heads would bite or consume whoever entered their territory. Also, the Melon Heads' territory commonly involves a secluded, rustic or dirt road running through it. This is one instance where elements of the legend interact over time and why some actual streets are mistakenly referred to as Dracula Drive by some locals.
In Connecticut, some of the inspiration for a number of versions of the Melon Heads' legends may be attributed to the local surroundings and landmarks. Central Fairfield County is home to the now defunct Fairfield Hills State Mental Hospital as well as the Garner Correctional Institution, both located in Newtown. The care and treatment for adult male offenders with significant mental health issues throughout the Connecticut Department of Correction were consolidated at Garner Correctional Institution. Also there is the  Federal Correctional Institution located in nearby Danbury. This part of Fairfield County has historically been a rural area filled with farms and forests. The proximity of several criminal and psychiatric institutions as well as their juxtaposition to rural areas of the county may have contributed elements to the legend of the Melon Heads.
Stories about deformed country people who keep to themselves are common in legend. While the legend of the Melon Heads is more widely told throughout Southwest Connecticut, one of several other similar legends of deformed or mutated humans can be found in various locations of Fairfield and New Haven County. These legends have been told in overlapping communities where some individuals would tell versions of one legend alongside other individuals who would tell versions of another legend. Over time this overlapping of oral tradition may have allowed the cross-contribution of elements to each other. Some similar legends include:

The Danbury Frog People (commonly told in Danbury/Bethel).
The Faceless People of Monroe / The House of the Faceless People (commonly told in Monroe).
Mongoloid Village (commonly told in the communities of central and eastern New Haven County like North Branford).

Theories
In Martha Warren Beckwith's Hawaiian AKA Ilenes Mythology, there are references to several other forest dwelling races: the ilene Irenes, who were large-sized wild hunters descended from Lua-nuʻu, the mu people, and the wa people.
Some early scholars hypothesized that there was a first settlement of Hawaiʻi, by settlers from the Marquesas Islands, and a second, from Tahiti. The Tahitian settlers oppressed the ""commoners"", the manahune in the Tahitian language, who fled to the mountains and were called Menahune. Proponents of this hypothesis point to an 1820 census of Kauaʻi by Kaumualiʻi, the ruling aliʻi aimoku of the island, which listed 65 people as menehune.
Folklorist Katharine Luomala believes that the legends of the Menehune are a post-European contact mythology created by adaptation of the term manahune (which by the time of the colonization of the Hawaiian Islands by Europeans had acquired a meaning of ""lowly people"" or ""low social status"" and not diminutive in stature) to European legends of brownies. It is claimed that ""Menehune"" are not mentioned in pre-contact mythology, but that is unproven since it was an oral mythology; the legendary ""overnight"" creation of the Alekoko fishpond, for example, finds its equivalent in the legend about the creation of a corresponding structure on Oʻahu, which was supposedly indeed completed in a single day not by menehune but as a show of power by a local aliʻi, who commanded all of his subjects to appear at the construction site and to assist in building.

According to legends, the Michigan Dogman appears in a ten-year cycle that falls on years ending in 7 and can be deterred by clapping loudly. Sightings have been reported in several locations throughout Michigan, primarily in the northwestern quadrant of the Lower Peninsula.

History
This creature was unknown to most of the modern world, until very late in the 20th century. It is said to have been stalking the area around the Manistee River since the days when the Odawa tribes lived there.
The first alleged encounter of the Michigan Dogman occurred in 1887 in Wexford County, when two lumberjacks saw a creature which they described as having a man's body and a dog's head.
In 1937 in Paris, Michigan, Robert Fortney was attacked by five wild dogs and said that one of the five walked on two legs. Reports of similar creatures also came from Allegan County in the 1950s, and in Manistee and Cross Village in 1967.
Other sightings include a series of occurrences in Ottawa County, Grand Haven from 1993 to 1994. Most of these reports came from a man simply referred to as “Ben”. He claims to have seen the beast on three separate occasions. One such sighting was in December 1993, wherein he spotted the Dogman in his parents' driveway on Lakewood Drive. The creature was standing behind the car on its hind legs, only running off when Ben started screaming. 
Another separate account was from someone else in 1994 in the same area. This report was of a run in which the reporter hit a large animal with his car, thinking it to be a deer. There was no corpse to be found, instead only gray fur within the grill of the car. 
Linda S. Godfrey, in her book The Beast of Bray Road, compares the Manistee sightings to a similar creature sighted in Wisconsin known as the Beast of Bray Road.

The Cook song
In 1987,  disc jockey Steve Cook at WTCM-FM in Traverse City, Michigan recorded a song titled ""The Legend"", which he initially played as an April Fool's Day joke. He based the songs on myths and legends from around North America, and had never heard of an actual Michigan ""dogman"" at the time of the recording:

I made it up completely from my own imagination as an April Fools' prank for the radio and stumbled my way to a legend that goes back all the way to Native American times.
Cook maintains his skepticism about the possibility of a real dogman, he had this to say about the matter:I'm tremendously skeptical, because I've sort of seen the way folklore becomes built from the creation of this song to what it's turned into ... but I do believe people who think they saw something really did see something. I also think the Dogman provides them with an avenue to explain what they couldn't explain for themselves.
Cook recorded the song with a keyboard backing and credited it to Bob Farley. After he played the song, Cook received calls from listeners who said that they had encountered a similar creature. In the next weeks after Cook first played the song, it was the most-requested song on the station. He also sold cassettes of the songs for four dollars, and donated proceeds from the single to an animal shelter. Over the years, Cook has received more than 100 reports of the creature's existence. In March 2010, the creature was featured in an episode of MonsterQuest. In January 2017, the creature was featured in the season 2 episode ""Great Lakes: Wolfman, Dogman, Wendigo"" of Monsters and Mysteries in America.
Other references to Dogman include various Youtube channels including Dogman Encounters Radio, Dogman Narratives,  Scary Stories NYC, Campfire Tales, Dogman Encounters with Jeffrey Nadolny, and Lilith Dread, as well as the creator Josh Nanocchio, the host of what lurks beneath.
Cook later added verses to the song in 1997 after hearing a report of an animal break-in by an unknown canine at a cabin in Luther, Michigan. He re-recorded it again in 2007, with a mandolin backing.

Feature film
In late 2011, filmmaker Rich Brauer released a film called Dogman, starring Larry Joe Campbell. The movie premiered at the State Theater in Traverse City.
The film included a brief segment of ""The Gable Film"", used with permission from Mike Agrusa, who received acknowledgement in the film credits.

The creature was first seen in July by Clarence ""Tuffy"" Cable, co-manager of the Blue Grass Body Shop, a junk and wrecking yard located north of Milton. As Cable was walking through the junkyard, he saw the lizard emerge from behind the wrecked vehicles and it hissed at him several times. He said it had ""big eyes similar to a frog's... Beneath its mouth was an off-white color and there were black and white stripes cross ways of its body with quarter-sized speckles over it.""
Cable's brother Garrett was the next to see the creature on July 27. While working in the junkyard, he saw a pile of old car hoods begin to vibrate and move as the lizard's head and shoulders emerged from underneath the debris. Frightened, he left to get his brother, but when they returned to the area, guns in hand, the creature was gone.
The next day, Cable saw the lizard (or one similar to it) again, except this time it appeared to be larger—nearly 15 feet in length. After throwing a rock at it, the diminishing beast hissed at him and fled into some brush.

In early August, a search party scoured the area surrounding the Blue Grass Body Shop for any sign of the lizard, but no evidence was found.

Description
The Mogollon Monster is commonly described as a large bipedal creature, over 7 feet (2 m) tall with large, red eyes. Its body is said to be covered with long black or reddish brown hair, with the exclusion of the chest, face, hands and feet. Reports claim it has a strong and pungent odor described as that of ""dead fish, a skunk with bad body odor, decaying peat moss and the musk of a snapping turtle"".
Anecdotal reports indicate the creature is allegedly nocturnal, omnivorous, territorial and sometimes violent. It is generally reported to: walk with wide, inhuman strides; leave behind footprints measuring 560 millimetres (22 in); mimic birds, coyotes and other wildlife; emit unusual whistle sounds; explore campsites after dark; build nests out of pine needles, twigs, and leaves; and hurl stones from locations that are hidden from view. The creature has also been said to decapitate deer and other wildlife prior to consumption. In numerous reports, the monster has been said to emit a ""blood-curdling"" scream; described as sounding like a woman in ""great distress"".  Accounts of the creature describe an ""eerie silence prior to the encounter, an appreciable stillness in the woods that commonly surrounds predatory animals"".

History
Reported sightings range along Arizona's Mogollon Rim, from Prescott north to Williams, southeast to Alpine, south to Clifton, and northwest back to Prescott.
The oldest known reported sighting was in the 1903 edition of The Arizona Republican, in which I.W. Stevens described a creature seen near the Grand Canyon as having ""long white hair and matted beard that reached to his knees. It wore no clothing, and upon his talon-like fingers were claws at least two inches long."" Upon further inspection he noted ""a coat of gray hair nearly covered his body, with here and there a spot of dirty skin showing."" He later stated that after he discovered the creature drinking the blood of two cougars, it threatened him with a club, and ""screamed the wildest, most unearthly screech"".
Cryptozoologist Don Davis reported that during the mid-1940s he was on a Boy Scout trip near Payson, Arizona, and gave the following account, ""The creature was huge. Its eyes were deep set and hard to see, but they seemed expressionless. His face seemed pretty much devoid of hair, but there seemed to be hair along the sides of his face. His chest, shoulders, and arms were massive, especially the upper arms; easily upwards of 6 inches in diameter, perhaps much, much more. I could see he was pretty hairy, but didn't observe really how thick the body hair was. The face/head was very square; square sides and squared up chin, like a box"". Marjorie Grimes, a Whiteriver, Arizona resident, claimed to have sighted the creature a number of times between 1982 and 2004. She described the creature as black, tall, and walking in big strides.
A number of people on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation also claimed to have seen the creature.

Investigation
Professor emeritus of biology, Stan Lindstedt, of Northern Arizona University, dismisses the idea that a large humanoid creature would remain hidden in such a large area of the country. ""I put that in the category of mythology that can certainly make our culture interesting, but has nothing to do with science.""
Generally the scientific community attributes creature sightings to either hoaxes or misidentification. As recently as the early 1930s, grizzly bears roamed the forests of Arizona. Other large mammals such as black bears, mountain lions and elk may also account for sightings.

In popular culture
The Mogollon Monster has become an object of Arizona folklore. One such story involves Arizona pioneer, Sam Spade, building a log cabin on land adjacent to what is now Camp Geronimo in northern Arizona, only to be attacked by the creature. Later his son Bill Spade and his soon to be wife are killed by the creature on their wedding day. Other stories explain the origins of the Mogollon Monster implicating a tormented Native American bent on revenge, or a chief transforming to scare away his former clan. Another story involves a pioneer who is attacked by Native Americans, escapes, but is cursed by the spirits and goes insane. Still another story describes the creature as the ""phantom of a white man who, as punishment for murdering a Native American woman, was hung from a tree by his hands, stretched to a height of eight feet, then skinned alive and left to die. Damned by the spirits, his ghost continues to roam the woods as the tragically misnamed Skinwalker"".
The monster is also a topic in guides on local color and works of fiction, including the following:

""Abstracts of folklore studies"". Abstracts of Folklore Studies. 10–11. American Folklore Society. 1974. ISSN 0001-3587. OCLC 1460586.
""Weird Arizona: Your Travel Guide to Arizona's Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets"". Sterling Publishing. 2007. ISBN 978-1402739385.
The creature is also present in the works of Dolan Ellis, who used a song named ""Mogollon Monster"" in a campaign against littering, especially in the wilderness areas of Arizona, claiming that the monster targeted those who carelessly littered in its territory.

Description
Alleged witnesses describe the creature as a large, bipedal humanoid, with a pumpkin sized head, about 7 ft (2.1 m) tall, covered in dark hair that emits a putrid odor.

History
The most well known alleged sighting occurred on July 11, 1972, when two young boys were playing in the backyard on the rural outskirts of Louisiana, Missouri. Their older sister, Doris, was in the kitchen when she heard her brothers screaming. When she looked out of the window, she observed a massive, dark haired, man-like creature holding what appeared to be a deceased dog. She described it as having a ""pumpkin-shaped head"", and large glowing orange eyes. 
Many alleged sightings occurred that year, most notably local fire department chief and member of the city council, Richard Allan Murray, who reported driving along a creek bed when he saw a massive upright creature in his vehicle's headlights. As a result of these reported encounters, a 20 person posse was formed to hunt the creature but nothing was ever found. 
In 2019, a docudrama horror film entitled Momo: The Missouri Monster, was released and features a dramatization of the events of 1972. The film's cast includes Cliff Barackman and James ""Bobo"" Fay, best known for their appearances as Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO) members on the Animal Planet series Finding Bigfoot.
American theme park Six Flags St. Louis had a ride that operated from 1973 until 1994 named after the creature.

Descriptions of the creature vary, with accounts ranging from a bumpy figure resembling a log with scales or a fin to a serpent-like entity.

Sightings
Visitors to Moon Lake have allegedly reported sightings of the monster over the years. During a family reunion, one witness described a figure resembling a log with a fin that appeared to follow their boat, with scales visible as water moved over it. Another account referred to the creature as ""black, ugly, and bumpy.""
Gary Sutherland, a former owner of Moon Lake Resort, claimed that sightings typically occur during calm, windless conditions in the early morning or evening. Witnesses have reported V-shaped ripples caused by a rounded object just below the surface. In 1994, Bill Reardon stated that he observed such a ripple through binoculars and described it as moving steadily and zigzagging across the lake. Reardon claimed to have ruled out logs or known animals as the cause.
Other reports describe a serpent-like creature. One resident stated that stories about the monster are well known in the area, comparing it to the Loch Ness Monster.

Folklore and legends
The Moon Lake Monster is reportedly tied to Ute tribal legends. One story claims that a burial canoe was pulled underwater by a large hand, leading the tribe to abandon the lake, believing it was cursed.
Another account involves two Native American children who disappeared in the lake. After search efforts failed to locate their bodies, the tribe believed a large aquatic creature was responsible.

Environmental context
Moon Lake, at an elevation of 8,300 feet in the Uinta Mountains, is a natural lake expanded by a dam built during the Great Depression. The lake, shaped like a crescent moon, is known for its sandy western shoreline, uncommon in the Rocky Mountains, and is a popular destination for fishing, hiking, and camping.
Some believe parts of the lake are bottomless, with speculation about underground passages connecting it to other areas of the state.

An annual festival in Point Pleasant is devoted to the Mothman legend.

History
On November 15, 1966, two young couples from Point Pleasant—Roger and Linda Scarberry, and Steve and Mary Mallette—told police they had seen a large black creature whose eyes ""glowed red"", standing at the side of the road near ""the TNT area"", the site of a former World War II munitions plant. Linda Scarberry described it as a 'slender, muscular man' about seven feet tall with white wings. However, she was unable to discern its face due to the hypnotic effect of its eyes. Distressed, the witnesses sped away, reporting that the creature flew after their car, making a screeching sound. It pursued them as far as Point Pleasant city limits.

Over the next few days, more people reported similar sightings after local newspapers covered it. Two volunteer firemen who saw it said it was a ""large bird with red eyes"". Mason County Sheriff George Johnson believed the sightings were due to an unusually large heron he termed a ""shitepoke"". Contractor Newell Partridge told Johnson that when he aimed a flashlight at a creature in a nearby field, its eyes glowed ""like bicycle reflectors"". Additionally, he blamed buzzing noises from his television set and the disappearance of his German Shepherd dog on the creature. Wildlife biologist Robert L. Smith at West Virginia University told reporters that descriptions and sightings fit the sandhill crane, a large American crane almost as tall as a man with a seven-foot wingspan and reddish coloring around its eyes. The bird may have wandered out of its migration route, and therefore was unrecognized at first because it was not native to this region.

Due to the popularity of the Batman TV series at the time, the fictional superhero Batman and his rogues gallery were prominently featured in the public eye. While the villain Killer Moth did not appear in the show, the comic book influence of both him and Batman is believed by some to have influenced the coinage of the name ""Mothman"" in the local newspapers.
Following the December 15, 1967, collapse of the Silver Bridge and the death of 46 people, the incident gave rise to the legend and connected the Mothman sightings to the bridge collapse.
According to Georgian newspaper Svobodnaya Gruziya, Russian UFOlogists claim that Mothman sightings in Moscow foreshadowed the 1999 Russian apartment bombings.
The Mothman Prophecies (2002) is a major motion picture, loosely based on the 1975 book of the same name by John Keel.
In 2016, WCHS-TV published a photo purported to be of Mothman taken by an anonymous man while driving on Route 2 in Mason County. Science writer Sharon Hill proposed that the photo showed ""a bird, perhaps an owl, carrying a frog or snake away"" and wrote that ""there is zero reason to suspect it is the Mothman as described in legend. There are too many far more reasonable explanations.""

Analysis
Folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand notes that Mothman has been widely covered in popular press, with some claiming sightings connected with UFOs, and others suggesting that a military storage site was Mothman's ""home"". Brunvand notes that the recountings of the 1966–67 Mothman reports usually state that at least 100 people saw Mothman with many more ""afraid to report their sightings."" However, he points out that these written sources for such stories consisted of children's books or sensationalized or undocumented accounts that fail to quote identifiable persons. Brunvand found elements in common among many Mothman reports and much older folk tales, suggesting that something real may have triggered the scares and became woven with existing folklore. He also records anecdotal tales of Mothman supposedly attacking the roofs of parked cars occupied by teenagers.
Conversely, Joe Nickell says that a number of hoaxes followed the publicity generated by the original reports, such as a group of construction workers who tied flashlights to helium balloons. Nickell attributes the Mothman stories to sightings of barred owls, suggesting that the Mothman's ""glowing eyes"" were actually red-eye effect caused from the reflection of light from flashlights or other bright light sources. Benjamin Radford points out that the only report of glowing ""red eyes,"" was secondhand, that of Shirley Hensley quoting her father. One of the prevailing hypotheses associated with the Mothman at the time of the original sightings was that it was a misidentified sandhill crane, due primarily to the size of the bird as well as the ""reddish flesh"" around the crane's eyes. Daniel A. Reed examined the migration patterns and historically reported sightings of Sand Hill Cranes in the area of Point Pleasant, West Virginia and proposed that, in cases where eyeshine was not noted, it was statistically more likely that witnesses were seeing and misidentifying a Great Blue Heron instead. In 1966, a snowy owl was shot by Ace Henry at Point Pleasant, and it was described in local newspapers as a ""giant owl"" because of its nearly five feet wingspan. It's been claimed that it may have been the origin of the Mothman sightings. The bird is still displayed as a mounted specimen at the Mothman Museum.
According to University of Chicago psychologist David A. Gallo, ""55 sightings of Mothman in Chicago during 2017"" published on the website of self-described Fortean researcher Lon Strickler are ""a selective sample"". Gallo explains that ""he's not sampling random people and asking if they saw the Mothman – he's just counting the number of people that voluntarily came forward to report a sighting."" According to Gallo, ""people more likely to visit a paranormal-centric website like Strickler's might also be more inclined to believe in, and therefore witness the existence of, a 'Mothman'.""
Some pseudoscience adherents (such as ufologists, paranormal authors, and cryptozoologists) suggest the Mothman could be an alien, a supernatural manifestation, or a previously unknown species of animal. In his 1975 book, Keel claimed that Point Pleasant residents experienced precognitions including premonitions of the collapse of the Silver Bridge, UFO sightings, visits from inhuman or threatening men in black, and other phenomena.

Festival and statues
Point Pleasant held its first Annual Mothman Festival in 2002. The Mothman Festival began after brainstorming creative ways to attract visitors to Point Pleasant. The group organizing the event chose the Mothman to be the center of the festival due to its uniqueness, and as a way to celebrate its local legacy in the town.
According to the event organizer Jeff Wamsley, the average attendance for the Mothman Festival is an estimated 10–12 thousand people per year.
A 12-foot-tall metallic statue of the creature, created by artist and sculptor Bob Roach, was unveiled in 2003. The Mothman Museum and Research Center opened in 2005. The festival is held on the third weekend of every September, hosting guest speakers, vendor exhibits, pancake-eating contests, and hayride tours of locally notable areas.

Pop culture
While the 1975 book and 2002 film The Mothman Prophecies may be the best known media regarding the legend, several low-budget and independently-made narrative films and documentary projects have since been released.

Small Town Monsters has released two documentaries about Mothman, The Mothman of Point Pleasant in 2017 and The Mothman Legacy in 2020.
Hellier, a 2019 digital documentary series released on YouTube and Amazon Prime, includes a segment in the second season dedicated to the Mothman.
The Point Pleasant Tapes is a found footage film, co-written and directed by Jesse P. Pollack, filmed with 1960s period-correct cameras in the same West Virginia area of the sightings. The completed film made its festival debut on October 19, 2024.

Each Spring, there is an event called the Marche du Nain Rouge where hundreds of people chase the Nain Rouge out of the city and burn them in effigy.

Legend
The Nain Rouge first appeared in Marie Caroline Watson Hamlin's 1883 book Legends of Le Détroit, where she described the Nain Rouge as a dwarf, ""very red in the face, with a bright, glistening eye,"" and with ""a grinning mouth displaying sharp, pointed teeth"". The Nain Rouge was then included in Charles M. Skinner's 1896 book Myths And Legends Of Our Own Land, described as ""a shambling, red-faced creature, with a cold, glittering eye and teeth protruding from a grinning mouth.""
Legend holds that Nain Rouge's appearance would presage terrible events for the white people of the city, and foretell success for the Indigenous People. The creature is said to have appeared on July 30, 1763 before the Battle of Bloody Run, where 58 British soldiers were killed by Native Americans from Chief Pontiac's Ottawa tribe. Supposedly, the Nain Rouge ""danced among the corpses"" on the banks of the Detroit River after the battle, and the river ""turned red with blood"" for days after. According to the tale, all the misfortunes of Governor and General William Hull leading to the surrender of Detroit in the War of 1812 are blamed on the Nain Rouge.
Several sightings were later reported during the 20th century. Two utility workers claim to have seen the creature just before the 1967 Detroit riots, and supposedly, it was also seen before an ice storm in 1976.
There are no records that indicate the legend of the Nain Rouge existed in the 18th century, when Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac was in authority in Detroit. The earliest record, Hamlin's Legends of Le Détroit, wasn't published until 1883, 180 years after Cadillac was said to have been cursed by the Nain Rouge. However, some claim that it originates in the early 1700s French settlement of Detroit, supposedly deriving from  Norman French tales of the lutin, a type of hobgoblin. Some also claim that the Nain Rouge originated with supposed Native American legends of an ""impish offspring of the Stone God"".
Wellesley College assistant professor Kate Grandjean, a specialist in early American and Native American history, says ""My personal feeling is it's really not quite as simple as just European colonists appropriating some Native American spirit ... I think, and it seems to be demonstrable in the historical record, that the Nain that we know in Detroit today probably has both French and Native traditions sort of wrapped up in it.""
Grandjean says the Nain Rouge is a defender of sorts for “those on the losing end of history ... Historically, the Nain Rouge has mostly been a menace to those in power.”

Local culture
The Nain Rouge legend has become an enduring part of the folklore of the Detroit area.

The Dance of the Nain Rouge
Artist Eric Millikin has been creating work based on the Nain Rouge since at least the early 2000s. His The Dance of the Nain Rouge is a 2023 short animated documentary film about the Detroit folklore legend of the Nain Rouge. The film is described as ""an experimental decolonial Detroit demonology deepfake dream dance documentary."" It has won several awards including ""Best Innovative Technologies Award"" (""Premio Migliori Tecnologie Innovative"") at the 2024 Pisa Robot Film Festival,  ""Best Animation Film"" at the 2024 Absurd Film Festival in Italy, ""Best AI Film"" at the Another Hole in the Head Film Festival in San Francisco, ""Best AI Film"" at the New York International Film Awards, ""Best AI (Artificial Intelligence) Film"" and ""Best Animated Film"" at GeekFestUniverse (formerly GeekFestToronto), and ""Best Art Direction"" at the International Avant-Garde Film Awards.

Marche du Nain Rouge
Each Spring since 2010, a costumed parade called the Marche du Nain Rouge has been held in Detroit, in which a person dressed like the Nain Rouge is chased out of the city. An effigy of the Nain Rouge is then burned, in what the organizers describe as ""banishing the evil spirit from the city for another year"". The parade participants wear masked costumes, supposedly so the Nain Rouge will not recognize them.
Critics have protested the banishment parade, arguing that the Nain Rouge is being unfairly blamed for the city's problems, and no one should be banished from the city, particularly those who have been there the longest and who are being targeted based on the color of their skin. One protester has said ""Originally the Nain Rouge was a Native American Earth spirit, a protector of Detroit. They turned him into a devil.""
Hundreds of people attend the event. The 2014 parade included a speech from Alexis Wiley, a representative for Mayor Mike Duggan, the first white mayor of the majority-black city since the early 1970s.

Nain Rouge alcoholic drinks
According to Watson Hamlin's Legends of Le Détroit, the Nain Rouge's curse on Cadillac was in part a response to Cadillac's damaging effects of selling of alcohol to the local Native Americans. in Hamlin's telling of the story, the fortune teller warns Cadillac that ""selling liquor to the savages ... will cause you much trouble and be the cause of your ruin."" Several contemporary businesses sell alcoholic drinks based on the legend of the Nain Rouge. Detroit Beer Company, a brewpub in Downtown Detroit, has as its signature brew a ""Detroit Dwarf"" lager, named in honor of the Nain Rouge. In 2015 Woodberry Wine, a distributor and wholesaler of fine wines and Kindred Vines Import Company, an importer of French and Italian wines both based out of the Metro-Detroit area introduced ""Nain Rouge Red""; a French red wine blend named after the Nain Rouge dwarf.

Devil's Night: Dawn of the Nain Rouge
Devil's Night: Dawn of the Nain Rouge is a 2019 English language feature film directed by Sam Logan Khaleghi based on the creature of the same name. The film marks the debut of Eminem's younger brother Nathan Kane Mathers. Swifty McVay, of the hip hop group D12, played the role of the mayor of Detroit and composed the song “Scariest Thing"" for the film. It had a nationwide USA release of June 23, 2020 on DVD and digital platforms.

Descriptions of the monster vary, but it is most commonly described as having a crocodile-like body and the head of a horse.

Sightings
The most well-known sighting occurred on July 8, 1877, when J.H. McNeil and other workers at the Barnes and Co. saltworks on the lake's northern shore claimed to have encountered a large creature with a crocodile-like body and the head of a horse. McNeil estimated the creature to be about 75 feet long. The creature reportedly let out a loud bellow as it approached the shore, prompting the men to flee into the nearby mountains, where they hid overnight. The next morning, they found large overturned boulders and disturbed ground along the shoreline.
McNeil signed an affidavit attesting to the sighting, and the story was published in the Corinne Record and later in the Salt Lake Herald-Republican and the Deseret News. However, the Deseret News suggested that the report should be taken ""with a few grains of salt."" Some skeptics proposed that the ""monster"" may have been a buffalo in the lake, although the reported length of 75 feet does not align with this explanation.
In another notable sighting, recorded in 1880, a group of Springville residents fishing on the lake reported seeing a serpentine creature with multiple humps breaking the water’s surface. The creature was described as being 50–60 feet long, with a head resembling that of a horse. Witnesses claimed the monster moved with incredible speed, disturbing the water around it as it submerged and resurfaced.
In more recent years, new accounts of the monster have emerged. In 2023, State Park Ranger Holly Minor recounted a story about two hunters on Stansbury Island who were reportedly chased into a cave by a creature described as part crocodile, part horse, with a wingspan of over 100 feet. According to the account, the creature returned with an entire cow in its mouth, leaving the hunters to hide in terror overnight.

Earlier sightings
The legend of the North Shore Monster may have roots in earlier reports. Around thirty years prior to McNeil's encounter, a man identified as Brother Bainbridge claimed to have seen a creature with a dolphin-like body in the lake near Antelope Island. Another official of the LDS church, referred to as Brother Kimball, reported seeing a porpoise in the lake on April 19, 1848. These sightings led to Antelope Island initially being named ""Porpoise Island."" Some theories suggest that the men may have mistaken large carp swimming in the less salty waters of Farmington Bay for these creature(s).
Additional early reports linked the monster to native Ute legends of ""Water Babies,"" mystical beings said to inhabit lakes and lure unsuspecting victims into the water. Some settlers in the 1860s claimed the Water Babies were manifestations of the North Shore monster itself.

Environmental factors
The Great Salt Lake's salinity fluctuates between 3.5 and 8 times that of the ocean, depending on location and water levels, and has a maximum depth of 33 feet. These extreme conditions limit the types of life that can thrive in the lake, with only a few species such as brine shrimp and brine flies found in the main lake. Carp and other fish species are able to survive in the freshwater wetlands and tributaries surrounding the lake.
Despite the challenging environment, legends about large creatures inhabiting the lake persist. These tales may have been influenced by sightings of unusual phenomena or by misunderstandings of natural occurrences in the lake's unique ecosystem.
One speculative theory suggests that shifts in the lake’s salinity levels and water temperature may influence sightings of unusual phenomena. Periodic fluctuations in salinity can create mirage-like optical effects on the water’s surface, potentially contributing to monster lore.

In media
In 1976, a short independent horror film titled The Giant Brine Shrimp was produced by Salt Lake local Mike Cassidy. The film depicts a fictional account of a giant brine shrimp terrorizing downtown Salt Lake City. Although the creature in the film is referred to as ""Old Briney,"" it bears little resemblance to the North Shore Monster, as it is portrayed as a massive version of the lake's native brine shrimp rather than the crocodile-like creature described in the original sightings.

The Ong was believed to inhabit the waters of Lake Tahoe (Wašiw: Da ow aga), preying on those who wandered too close. According to legend, it carried its victims to its nest at the center of the lake, where they were never seen again, until being defeated by a clever Washoe warrior.","The Ong is a mythical creature from Washoe (Wašiw) folklore, described as a giant bird with an eagle-like body, a warrior's face, and wings longer than the tallest pine trees. The Ong was believed to inhabit the waters of Lake Tahoe (Wašiw: Da ow aga), preying on those who wandered too close. According to legend, it carried its victims to its nest at the center of the lake, where they were never seen again, until being defeated by a clever Washoe warrior.

The story of the Ong
The Ong is a creature from Washoe mythology, said to haunt the waters of Lake Tahoe (Wašiw: Da ow aga). The Washoe feared the Ong, believing it preyed on those who wandered too close, dragging them to its nest in the center of the lake where they would be consumed. The myth states that no weapon could pierce its tough feathers and scales, making it nearly invincible.

Description
In some traditions, the Ong was said to be a massive reptilian bird; in others, it had the body of an eagle, the face of a warrior, and wings longer than the tallest pine trees. Its wing beats could create strong winds, bending debeleš (trees) along the shore. The bird's webbed feet and nest at the center of the lake allowed it to trap animals, trout, and people swept into the currents. The Washoe believed that anything caught in the lake's pull would be carried to the Ong's nest. Those who drowned were thought to be taken by the Ong, their bodies never recovered.
To avoid being captured by the Ong, the Washoe took care not to travel, hunt, or fish alone. The Ong's wing beats were so powerful they could bend trees near the shore whenever it flew by. Despite its great strength, the Ong was described as cowardly, attacking only lone individuals and avoiding groups or people in camps.

Washoe/Wašiw Tribe Legend
As told by the Washoe Tribe, Ong was a giant man-eating bird that nested in the middle of Lake Tahoe on a spire that rose from the water.
One day, the Ong captured a Washoe man and carried him to its nest. Fortunately, the Ong had another victim first, allowing the captive time to observe the creature. He noticed that the Ong closed its mešəmeš (eyes) when chewing. Using this, he devised a plan. Every time the Ong opened its dunem (mouth), he threw several paçaga (obsidian arrowheads) inside. By nightfall, the Ong had fallen ill.
A storm raged through the night, and by morning, the creature was dead. The Washoe man plucked one of its massive feathers and used it as a boat to return to shore.

Other interpretations
Several variations of the Ong legend exist. One version published in Sunset Magazine (1905) and later referenced by Nevada Magazine differs from the Washoe oral tradition by adding a romantic subplot. In this account, a young Washoe warrior named Tahoe seeks to prove his bravery to win the hand of Nona, the chief's daughter. Unlike traditional versions, where the Ong is an unseen predator, this version describes Tahoe deliberately attracting it by praying on a cliffside. The Ong emerges from the lake and seizes him, lifting him into the air. Tahoe ties himself to its leg with a leather thong to prevent being dropped. Each time the creature opens its mouth, he throws poisoned arrowheads inside, weakening it until it crashes into the lake. Believed lost, he later returns at dawn, riding the Ong’s wing back to shore alongside Nona. This version presents a decisive defeat of the Ong.
Another version states that after the Ong captured a Washoe man, it carried him to its nest. The captive observed that the Ong closed its eyes while chewing, allowing him to secretly throw paçaga (obsidian arrowheads) into its mouth. By nightfall, the Ong had fallen ill, and after a storm raged through the night, it was found dead by morning.
Though the Ong is defeated in all versions, some legends claim its nest remains at the bottom of Lake Tahoe, claiming that is why the bodies of those who drown in the lake are rarely recovered.

Many doubt its existence, stating the Paddler sightings could be passed off as a naval submarine on a practice dive, a sturgeon of behemoth size, waterlogged trees, or even stolen boats and off-the-rails railroad cars.

History
The monster's first appearance in the North Idaho lake was reported in 1944. Upon learning the date, many locals think the monster may be a submarine from the Farragut Naval Training Center, now Farragut State Park, and odd shapes seen below water are submarines taking deep dives of Lake Pend Oreille, a practice which began during World War II and continued through the Cold War.
Alleged sightings began again in the 1970s, renewing rumors of a large, silver monster inhabiting the lake. Then in 1977 a young girl, playing at Sandpoint City Beach, survived a monster attack, whom the reporters dubbed the ""Pend Oreille Paddler"". The moniker stuck. 

In 1983, a local North Idaho College (NIC) professor, James R. McLeod, created a cryptozoology club at the Coeur d'Alene college and after reading an appendix in Loren Coleman's book, Mysterious America, decided to investigate the local lake and its monstrous inhabitant. McLeod's team of cryptozoologist researchers (made up of the cryptozoology club members) set out to Lake Pend Oreille in search of the Paddler. His investigation concluded after the team discovered the tabloid photo of the Paddler was of a papier-mâché catfish, 12 feet in length and originally from a 1974 Sandpoint play. However, he did propose that the monster could be a real deep water fish, possibly a pre-historic sturgeon.
Another sighting occurred in 1985 on Memorial Day by a local Coeur d'Alene teacher, Julie Green, who gave chase to the ""gunmetal grey object"" that appeared only a few hundred yards away from her boat. Followers of James R. McLeod's research would state that this description adds credibility to the following theory: the U.S. Navy created the monster to cover up top-secret nuclear submarine and sonar testing conducted in lake Pend Oreille.  

The final, officially documented, sighting happened in 2007; a photo was sent to the CryptoMundo site and reported there by cryptozoologist, Loren Coleman.
In 2009, Washington State University professor, Dr. Michael A. Delahoyde, created a ""Monsters"" course for the English Department of the university and used James R. McLeod's book as a reference for the section on lake monsters. The study of local folklore continued when best-selling author, Nicholas Redfern wrote his Monsters of the Deep in 2021.

The original site of the painting was on lithographic limestone, which was quarried away in the late 1870s by the Mississippi Lime Company.

History
Murals
The original mural was created prior to the arrival of any European explorers in the region. The location of the image was at a river-bluff terminus of the American Bottom floodplain. It may have been an older iconograph from the large Mississippian culture city of Cahokia, which began developing about 900 CE. Cahokia was at its peak about 1200 CE, with 20,000 to 30,000 residents. It was the largest prehistoric city north of Mexico and a major chiefdom. Icons and animal pictographs such as falcons, thunderbirds, bird men, and monstrous snakes were common motifs of the Cahokia culture.

An Alton Evening Telegraph newspaper article of May 27, 1921, stated that seven smaller painted images, carved and painted in rocks, believed to be of archaic American Indian origin, were found in the early 20th century about 1.5 miles upriver from the ancient Piasa creature's location. These pictures were  authenticated in the Levis Bluffs area by George Dickson and William Turk in 1905. According to the article, four of these paintings were of ""an owl, a sun circle, a squirrel, and a piece showing two birds or some kind of animals in a contest"", the other three paintings were of ""a great animal, perhaps a lion, and another an animal about as large as a coyote"". These paintings were photographed by Professor William McAdams and were to be placed in his book Records of Ancient Races in the Mississippi Valley. These seven archaic American Indian paintings were lost in transit to the Missouri Historical Society c. 1922. Other Native American carved petroglyphs of a similar time period and region as the Piasa monster are carved into the rocks at Washington State Park in Missouri about 60 miles southwest of the current Piasa image.
The 1797–8 map of French explorer Nicolas De Finiels shows the cliffs above the Piasa labeled as Hauteurs De Paillisa.
An earlier 1778 map titled ""A new map of the western parts of Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland and North Carolina; comprehending the river Ohio, and all the rivers, which fall into it; part of the river Mississippi, the whole of the Illinois River, ... Author Hutchins, Thomas, 1730–1789"" clearly shows the place name ""PIASAS"" where the present day City of Alton is located and bounded by the Wood River to the east. This map is one of the earliest documented references for the word Piasa.

Discovery
In 1673, Father Jacques Marquette saw the painting on a limestone bluff overlooking the Mississippi River while exploring the area. He recorded the following description:

""While skirting some rocks, which by their height and length inspired awe, we saw upon one of them two painted monsters which at first made us afraid, and upon which the boldest savages dare not long rest their eyes. they are as large as a calf; they have horns on their heads like those of a deer, a horrible look, red eyes, a beard like a tiger's, a face somewhat like a man's, a body covered with scales, and so long a tail that it winds all around the body, passing above the head and going back between the legs, ending in a fish's tail. green, red, and black are the three colors composing the picture. Moreover, these two monsters are so well painted that we cannot believe that any savage is their author; for good painters in France would find it difficult to reach that place conveniently to paint them. Here is approximately the shape of these monsters, as we have faithfully copied it.""
The French cartographer Jean-Baptiste-Louis Franquelin compiled a map titled ""The Mississippi"" in about the year 1682, from Louis Jolliet's description of his 1673 journey with Father Marquette. A creature similar to the underwater panther is sketched on the map east of the Missouri River and south of the Illinois River. As in Marquette's description, the animal is wingless with no resemblance to a bird.
Later French explorers, like St. Cosme, reported that by 1699 the series of images were badly worn due to the habits of the local Indians to ""discharge their weapons"" at the images as they passed.  Author A. D. Jones, in his book ""Illinois and the West"" c. 1838, also describes the ravages of weapons (firearms) upon the images, and further refers to the paintings as being named ""Piasua"".
The original image was the largest Native American painting ever found in North America.

John Russell account
The monster depicted in the mural was first referred to as the ""Piasa Bird"" in an article published c. 1836 by John Russell of Bluffdale, Illinois. John Russell was a professor of Greek and Latin at Shurtleff College, Upper Alton, Illinois. The article was entitled ""The Tradition of The Piasa"" and Russell claimed the origin of the word to be from a nearby stream: ""This stream is the Piasa. Its name is Indian, and signifies, in the Illini, ""The Bird That Devours Men."" The original Piasa Creek ran through the main ravine in downtown Alton, and was completely covered by huge drainage pipes around 1912. According to the story published by Russell, the creature depicted by the painting was a huge bird that lived in the cliffs. Russell claimed that this creature attacked and devoured people in nearby Indian villages shortly after the corpses of a war gave it a taste for human flesh. The legend claims that a local Indian chief, named Chief Ouatoga, managed to slay the monster using a plan given to him in a dream from the Great Spirit. The chief ordered his bravest warriors to hide near the entrance of the Piasa Bird's cave, which Russell also claimed to have explored. Ouatoga then acted as bait to lure the creature out into the open. As the monster flew down toward the Indian chief, his warriors slew it with a volley of poisoned arrows. Russell claimed that the mural was painted by the Indians as a commemoration of this heroic event.
Some sources report that this account was simply a story created by John Russell. In the book Records of Ancient Races in the Mississippi Valley ...  Chapter 2, 1887, by W. McAdams, the author says he contacted John Russell, who admitted the story was fabricated.
The bird imagery is not reported in Father Marquette's description, which makes no mention of wings. It is also possible that Marquette's description and Russell's account were both accurate for their respective times.  The image may have been repainted at some point between 1673 and 1836 to revise its appearance.
When contemporary historians, folklorists, and tourism promoters are looking for a narrative description of the story behind the Piasa ""Bird"", they often rely on Russell's account.

Origin Story
Esarey, Costa, Wood, et al now link the Underwater Panther to the Piasa both iconographically and phonetically to proper legend.  ""Payiihsa"" is a ""small supernatural being"" and ""pai'ssa"" was referenced in an early explorer's list of supernatural beings.  The ""Payiihsa"" often bear large feet with 4 or 6 toes and are referenced frequently in pottery and rock art symbolism along with the symbolism of the underwater panther.  (To complicate matters, the term ""Piasa"" was applied in the 1970s to any symbolism matching the ""protean super theme"" of underwater panthers.)  Costa's research in 2005 led to a Miami-Illinois Indian's tale of the malevolent twin dwarves (the ""Payiihsaki""), the underwater panther, and the supernatural culture hero known as the Illinois Trickster, ""Wissa Katch Akwa"" who encounter a French trader.  This legend of the Payiihsaki and the cliff art of underwater panther, as misinterpreted by Russell and others, is now believed by Esarey to be the origin of Russell's story of the Piasa.
The Underwater Panther origin is supported by research by Dr. Mark J. Wagner, Director, Center for Archaeological Investigations and Professor, Department of Anthropology, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale.

Numerous urban legends exist about the creature's origins and the methods it employs to claim its victims. According to some accounts, the creature uses either hypnosis or voice mimicry to lure trespassers onto the trestle to meet their death before an oncoming train. Other stories claim the monster jumps down from the trestle onto the roofs of cars passing beneath it. Yet other legends tell that it attacks its victims with a blood-stained axe and that the very sight of the creature is so unsettling that those who see it while walking across the high trestle are driven to leap off.
Other legends hold that the monster is a human-goat hybrid, and that it was a circus freak who vowed revenge after being mistreated. In one version, it is said the monster escaped after a train derailed on the trestle. Another version commonly told by locals of the area claims that the monster is really the twisted reincarnated form of a farmer who sacrificed goats in exchange for Satanic powers.
The legends have turned the area into a site for legend tripping. There have been a number of deaths and accidents at the trestle since its construction, despite the presence of an 8-foot (2.4 m) fence to keep thrill-seekers out.

There is a common misconception that the trestle is abandoned and no longer used; in reality, the bridge carries a major rail artery into Louisville. Heavy freight trains cross the bridge several times daily, so it is easy for someone to get caught atop it while an oncoming train barrels down on them. Norfolk Southern Railway urged citizens not to climb the trestle, saying if caught they would be arrested.","The Pope Lick Monster (more commonly, colloquially, the Goat Man) is a legendary part-man, part-goat and part-sheep creature reported to live beneath a railroad trestle bridge over Pope Lick Creek, in the Fisherville neighborhood of Louisville, Kentucky, United States.

Norfolk Southern Railway urged citizens not to climb the trestle, saying if caught they would be arrested.

Media
The monster was the subject of a 1988 film by Louisville filmmaker Ron Schildknecht called The Legend of the Pope Lick Monster. The 16-minute, $6,000 film premiered on December 29, 1988, at the Uptown Theater. Most of the film was shot at the Pope Lick Trestle, but scenes showing the characters up on the trestle were shot at another, safer location.
Norfolk Southern Railway officials were very upset about the film, as they thought it would encourage teenagers to visit the trestles. They found one scene in particular dangerously misleading. In the scene, the main character, a high school student, narrowly escapes an approaching train by hanging off the side of the trestle. In reality, few people would have the strength to hang on for the 5 to 7 minutes it takes for a long train to clear the 772-foot (235 m) trestle; in addition, the vibrations from the train are so strong that the ground beneath the trestle shakes as the train passes.
Because railroad officials were worried that the film would add to the death toll, Norfolk Southern issued a statement, read at the premiere, which warned of the trestle's dangers and informed the audience that anyone caught on the trestle could be prosecuted for trespassing.
The story of the monster was featured in an episode of Destination America's Monsters and Mysteries in America titled ""Ozarks"".

Deaths
Several people have died on or near the train trestle at Pope Creek in pursuit of the Pope Lick Monster legend.
In 1988, a 17-year-old young man, Jack “J.C.” Charles Bahm II, was hit and killed by a train, and another young man was injured while trying to cross the trestle. In 1994, a man was killed by a train after his ATV overturned on the trestle, trapping him on the track. In 2000, a 19-year-old man fell to his death after encountering a train. On April 23, 2016, a 26-year-old tourist, Roquel Bain, from Ohio died after being hit by a train while searching for the monster. Her boyfriend survived by hanging on the side of the trestle.
On May 26, 2019, Savanna Bright, 15, was pronounced dead at the scene after she and another teenage girl, Kaylee Keeling, were on the train tracks near the Pope Lick trestle. Keeling survived and was taken to University of Louisville Hospital.

Sightings tend to link the monster to the Proctor Valley Road, a dirt road that connects the community of Jamul in the northeast to the Eastlake neighborhood of Chula Vista in the southwest.

Description
The cryptid's appearance is still debated by locals. Accounts vary, but two of the most agreed-upon versions of the creature are of a tall, hairy, Bigfoot-type, or a ""disarranged cow"" bovine type. The nearby Bonita Museum & Cultural Center claims to have an unknown humanoid footprint of a creature on display. Many locals attribute this as concrete evidence of the cryptid's existence.

In popular culture
The Proctor Valley Monster has inspired a comic book series produced by Boom! Studios titled ""Proctor Valley Road"" in which the cryptid is blamed for the disappearances of a group of students participating in a Ghost Tour of the road.
The Bonita Museum & Cultural Center has hosted Film Festivals dedicated to celebrating the Proctor Valley Monster.

They are often depicted as withered and aged, flying through the night while emitting cries resembling a raven’s call. Consuming the hearts of their victims, they absorb the remaining years of life.

Though invisible to most, skilled medicine men can detect and repel them. According to tradition, recognizing a Raven Mocker in its true form causes it to die within seven days.

Mythology
The Raven Mocker, or Kâ'lanû Ahkyeli'skï (Cherokee: ᎪᎳᏅ ᎠᏰᎵᏍᎩ), is said to prey on the sick or dying to extend its lifespan. At night, it is believed to fly through the air in fiery form, with outstretched arms resembling wings and sparks trailing behind. Their flight is accompanied by the sound of rushing wind and their cries, described as resembling a raven's dive call, are considered an omen of death. 
Raven Mockers are said to gather at the homes of the dying, tormenting their victims by pressing on their chests to restrict breathing or throwing them to the ground. After the victim dies, the Raven Mocker is believed to remove and consume the heart to absorb the victim's remaining lifespan. No marks are left on the body, but the heart is said to be missing. 
Although feared for their power, other witches are said to avoid the Raven Mocker. Medicine men, using special knowledge, can detect and repel them from entering homes. Tradition holds that if a Raven Mocker is seen in its true form, it dies within seven days. Gunskaliski, a renowned Cherokee shaman, was said to have destroyed several Raven Mockers by using a special tea made from duck-root, enabling him to see them.

Other Names
In Cherokee tradition, Raven Mockers are also called ""Kâ'lanû Ahkyeli'skï"" (""The Death Spirit"") and ""Tsundige’wi"" (""He Who Covers His Face""). Other titles such as ""Death Caller"" and ""Heart Eater"" reflect their feared ability to consume hearts and steal life.

Stories
A notable tale involves a young hunter who sought refuge in what appeared to be an abandoned home. While resting, he heard the cry of a raven. An old man and woman returned to the house and revealed themselves as Raven Mockers when they discussed stealing lives. The hunter witnessed them roasting what appeared to be a human heart. The next morning, the old man gave the hunter a gift of beadwork, warning him not to speak of what he saw. However, the hunter discarded the gift in a stream and informed his village. Seven days later, a group of warriors found the couple dead and burned their home to ensure the destruction of the Raven Mockers.
Another story recounts how two men prepared by a medicine man fasted for seven days and were given a vision-enhancing remedy made from muskrat brain. This enabled them to witness creatures, including a Raven Mocker, gathered near a grave. The men saw the Raven Mocker dig into the earth but fled in fear after attempting to stop it. They later underwent healing rituals to recover from the experience.
Another account tells of a man left to die alone because his family feared the presence of Raven Mockers. As he lay dying, witnesses claimed the Raven Mockers tormented him, hastening his death by pressing on his chest and lifting him from his bed. After his death, it was believed they stole his heart to extend their lives.
One final tale describes a medicine man successfully protecting a dying individual by performing powerful rituals. Witches, including a Raven Mocker, gathered outside the home but were repelled. The Raven Mocker’s presence caused the other witches to scatter in fear.

In Fiction
Manly Wade Wellman featured Raven Mockers in his novel The Old Gods Waken (1979), where they are among the creatures encountered by Silver John in Appalachian folklore.
Scott Nicholson portrayed beings similar to Raven Mockers in his novel They Hunger (2007), set in a gorge resembling the Linville Gorge Wilderness in Appalachia.
P.C. Cast depicted Raven Mockers as antagonists in her House of Night series. In this series, they are the ""spirit"" children of the fallen angel Kalona and human women, possessing the ability to steal the lives of those near death.
Raven Mockers also appear in The Curse of the Raven Mocker by Marly Youmans, where the protagonist, Adanta, seeks to stop a figure resembling a Raven Mocker to save her mother.
A Raven Mocker is the main antagonist in ""Evil in the Night,"" episode 57 of Walker, Texas Ranger, where it is depicted as a medicine man with shape-shifting abilities and the power to cause hallucinations in his victims.
In Faith Hunter's Jane Yellowrock series, Raven Mockers are mentioned in connection with the protagonist, a skinwalker of Cherokee heritage.
The Raven Mocker is an antagonist in the series Mountain Monsters.

df388ab9-0eda-48f0-803d-ac468b8b1855,Rougarou,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rougarou,Rougarou,"The Rougarou (alternatively spelled as roux-ga-roux, rugaroo, or rugaru) is a legendary creature in Cajun diaspora communities linked to traditional concepts of the werewolf.","The Rougarou (alternatively spelled as roux-ga-roux, rugaroo, or rugaru) is a legendary creature in Cajun diaspora communities linked to traditional concepts of the werewolf.

Versions
The stories of the creature known as a rougarou are as diverse as the spelling of its name, though they are all connected to francophone cultures through a common derived belief in the loup-garou (French pronunciation: [lu ɡaˈʁu], ). Loup is French for wolf, and garou (from Frankish warulf, cognate with English werewolf) is a man who transforms into an animal.

American folklore
""Rougarou"" represents a variant pronunciation and spelling of the original French loup-garou. According to Barry Jean Ancelet, an academic expert on Cajun folklore and professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in America, the tale of the rougarou is a common legend across French Louisiana. Both words are used interchangeably in southern Louisiana. Some people call the monster rougarou; others refer to it as the connor last.
The rougarou legend has been spread for many generations, either directly from French settlers to Louisiana (New France) or via the French Canadian immigrants centuries ago.
In the Creole and Cajun legends, the creature is said to prowl the swamps around Acadiana and Greater New Orleans, and the sugar cane fields and woodlands of the regions. The rougarou most often is described as a creature with a human body and the head of a wolf or dog, similar to the werewolf legend.
Often the story-telling has been used to inspire fear and obedience. One such example is stories that have been told by elders to persuade Creole and Cajun children to behave. According to another variation, the wolf-like beast will hunt down and kill Catholics who do not follow the rules of Lent. This coincides with the French Catholic loup-garou stories, according to which the method for turning into a werewolf is to break Lent seven years in a row.
A common blood sucking legend says that the rougarou is under the spell for 101 days. After that time, the curse is transferred from person to person when the rougarou draws another human's blood. During that day the creature returns to human form. Although acting sickly, the human refrains from telling others of the situation for fear of being killed.
Other stories range from the rougarou as a rabbit to the rougarou being derived from witchcraft. In the latter claim, only a witch can make a rougarou—either by turning into a wolf herself, or by cursing others with lycanthropy.

In popular culture
The NBA team formerly known as the New Orleans Hornets filed for several new name trademarks among which was the Rougarous.
Boxer Regis Prograis (of Creole descent) goes by the nickname Rougarou.
The rougarou is incorporated into the story of an episode of the American television show NCIS: New Orleans. In the episode a victim is killed while investigating a possible sighting of the rougarou, which occurs in the 20th episode of the sixth season.
The novel Empire of Wild (2019; Penguin Random House Canada) by Cherie Dimaline is ""inspired by the traditional Métis story of the Rogarou—a werewolf-like creature that haunts the roads and woods of Métis communities.""
The show Shadow of the Rougarou (2022, APTN lumi, AppleTV+), by Métis director Jordan Waunch, was created with the guidance of Elders and Knowledge Keepers to best represent the communal oral story.
The roller coaster Rougarou at Cedar Point is named after this creature.
Rougarous has been repeatedly mentioned in the hit American TV series Supernatural.
The rougarou is featured in the videogame South of Midnight, where the main character, Hazel, encounters it while searching for her mother. It is depicted as a large avian-like creature.

Though escapees and former pets may survive for a short time in New York sewers, longer-term survival is not possible due to the low temperatures and the bacteria in human feces. Sewer maintenance crews insist there is no underground population of alligators in sewers.

Legend
The legend of alligators inhabiting the sewer system of New York City is a widely circulated urban myth. It suggests that alligators navigate the city's sewers, preying on rats and other refuse, and posing a threat to sewer workers, who are said to carry firearms for protection. According to the lore, these alligators are often described as large and vicious, with some attributing a lack of pigmentation to their purported status as ""albinos."" The urban myth has permeated popular culture, featuring in various forms of media including books, television shows, and movies. It has also inspired hoaxes and artistic projects, and is commemorated in the city with a quasi-holiday known as Alligator in the Sewer Day, celebrated on February 9. 
Following reports of sewer alligators in the 1930s, the story built up over the decades and became more of a contemporary legend. It is questionable how accurate the original stories are, and some have even suggested they are fictions created by Teddy May, who was the Commissioner of Sewers at the time. Interviews with him were the basis of the first published accounts of sewer alligators. In their honor, February 9 is Alligators in the Sewers Day in Manhattan.
A similar story from 1851 involves feral pigs in the sewers of Hampstead, London.

Louisiana or Florida to New York City
As late as the middle of the 20th century, souvenir shops in Florida sold live baby alligators (in small fish tanks) as novelty souvenirs. Tourists from New York City would buy a baby alligator and try to raise it as a pet. When the alligator grew too large for comfort, the family would proceed to flush the reptile down the toilet.
The most common story is that the alligators survive and reside within the sewer and reproduce, feeding on rats and garbage, growing to huge sizes and striking fear into sewer workers. In Robert Daley's book The World Beneath the City (1959) he comments that one night a sewer worker in New York City was shocked to find a large albino alligator swimming toward him. Weeks of hunting followed.
The Journal of American Folklore has this to say on the subject:

""According to May, sewer inspectors first reported seeing alligators in 1935, but neither May nor anyone else believed them. ""Instead, he set men to watch the sewer walkers to find out how they were obtaining whisky down in the pipes."" Persistent reports, however, perhaps including the newspaper item discovered by Coleman, caused May to go down to find out for himself. He found that the reports were true. ""The beam of his own flashlight had spotlighted alligators whose length, on the average, was about two feet.""
May started an extermination campaign, using poisoned bait followed by flooding of the side tunnels to flush the beasts out into the major arteries where hunters with .22 rifles were
waiting. He announced in 1937 that the 'gators were gone. Reported sightings in 1948 and 1966 were not confirmed.

However, there is no mention of ""blind albino"" alligators, and May suggests that the baby alligators were dumped down storm drains rather than ""flushed down the toilet"".
An additional reference to the sewer alligator exists in Thomas Pynchon's first novel, V. It fictionalizes the account, stating Macy's was selling them for a time for 50 cents.  Eventually the children became bored with the pets, setting them loose in the streets as well as flushing them into the sewers.  Rather than poison, shotguns were used as the remedy.  Benny Profane, one of the main characters in the book, continues to hunt them as a full-time job until the population is reduced.
A 1973 children's book, The Great Escape: Or, The Sewer Story by Peter Lippman anthropomorphizes these alligators and has them dress up in disguise as humans and charter an airplane to fly them home to the Florida swamps.

Versions including albinos and mutants
Some claims go further to suggest that, after the alligator was disposed of at such a young age, it would live the majority of its life in an environment not exposed to sunlight, and thus it would apparently in time lose its eyesight and the pigment in its hide and that the reptile would grow to be blind and completely albino (pure white in color with red or pink eyes). Another reason why an albino alligator would retreat to an underground sewer is its vulnerability to the sun in the wild; as there is no dark pigment in the creature's skin, it has no protection from the sun, which makes it very hard for it to survive in the wild.
Some people even spoke of mutant alligators living in the sewers which have been exposed to many different types of toxic chemical waste which altered them, making them deformed and sometimes even larger and with strange colouring. A gigantic mutant alligator based on these myths appears in the 1980 film Alligator.

Contemporary accounts
One 1927 account describes an experience of a Pittsburgh Bureau of Highways and Sewers employee who was assigned the task of clearing out a section of sewer pipe on Royal Street in the Northside Section of the city. The account reads, ""[He] removed the manhole cover and began to clear an obstruction when he realized that a set of 'evil looking eyes' was staring at him."" He then removed a 3-foot (0.91 m) alligator and took it home with him. There are other numerous recent media accounts of alligators occupying storm drains and sewer pipes, all from states in the southern US.
In Paris, France, a Nile crocodile was captured by firefighters in the sewers below the Pont Neuf bridge on March 7, 1984. The crocodile, named Eleonore (or Eleanore), lived at the Aquarium in Vannes and died in May 2022.
A 2-foot (0.61 m) baby alligator was caught in August 2010 by the NYPD in the sewers in Queens. However, it is unlikely that a fully grown adult would survive for long in New York, due to the cold winter temperatures.

Real alligators in sewers
Alligators are occasionally sighted in the drains and sewers of Florida, due to many of these waste outlets' backing out onto the swamps. A 2024 study using wildlife cameras to investigate storm sewers around Alachua County documented the presence of 35 species of wildlife, including alligators.

Modern history
The first documented sighting by western settlers occurred in 1920 when workers cutting ties at the upper end of the lake thought they saw a log in the lake.  The “log” began to move.
In August 1944 the serpent was reportedly seen by several groups of people who described it as 30 to 35 feet in length, with a dinosaur-type head and pronounced jaws, humps like a camel, and shell-like skin.
In September 1946 the serpent was reportedly sighted by a group of twenty people.  Dr. G.A. Taylor of Nampa, Idaho explained that “it appeared to be between 30 and 40 feet long and seemed to keep diving into the water.  It left a wake about like a small motor boat would make.”
In 1954 A. Boone McCallum, Editor of The Star News  held a contest to name the serpent of Payette Lake.  The winning name, “Sharlie”, was submitted by Le Isle Hennefer Tury of Springfield, Virginia.  In her letter to Mr. McCallum she said, “Why don’t you call the thing Sharlie?  You know – ‘Vas you der, Sharlie?”  This was a reference to the popular catch phrase often spoken by Jack Pearl during his old time radio show.
Sharlie was reportedly sighted dozens of times between 1956 and the last documented sighting in 1997.

Etymology
While there is little written historical record of the word simbi, there is consensus that it originated within Bantu-speaking and Kongo-speaking communities and almost certainly began as a means for them to understand the spiritual nature of the world around them. Some believe the word simbi derives from simba, a Kikongo word that means ""to hold, keep, preserve."" The similar phrase, isimba ia nsi, which translates to ""a distinguished person in the community,"" was recorded in an early Kikongo dictionary in the seventeenth century. This phrase and others, such as kisímbi kinsí, which translates to ""the very old person who does not die,"" are a few of the earliest evidences of the spiritual connection of bisimbi to the land of the living and the land of the dead. The word basimbi also translates to ""guardians"" with the phrase isimba ia nsi later becoming ""guardians of the land.""

Kongo spirituality
The Bakongo people traditionally believe that bisimbi are magically water spirits (in kikongo: nkisi mia mamba) that can appear as a person, a snake, pottery, a calabash vine, or Kalûnga, a spark of fire, similar to the spark that begot the universe in Kongo creation mythology. There have also been claims of bisimbi appearing as birds, twisted trees and mermaid-like beings. They are seen as the guardians of nature and the intermediaries who travel the Kalûnga Line between Ku Seke, the physical world of the living, and Ku Mpémba, the spiritual world of the ancestors. Bisimbi are also believed to be spiritual guides, using storytelling and oral tradition to connect the living to the ancestors and their history. The likening of the living elders to the bisimbi in the phrase kisímbi kinsí highlights the importance of Bakongo elders to the spiritual well-being of the community and the passing of their beliefs from one generation to the next.

Hoodoo
The belief that bisimbi ""inhabit rocks, gullies, streams, and pools, and are able to influence the fertility and well being of those living in the area"" was translocated to the United States by enslaved Bakongo and Mbundu peoples. Because forty percent of Africans taken during the trans-atlantic slave trade came from Central Africa's Congo Basin, and bisimbi became revered in the United States in Black American communities in Hoodoo tradition across the American South. Some Black churches prayed to Kongo-derived simbi spirits during Baptism and it was believed that simbi spirits were present when congregants were dipped into the water and washed clean. This belief highlighted the Central African influence on Christian baptism, the fusion of both traditional African and new Black American spiritual practices, and the evolving nature of Black spirituality in the Americas.

Sightings
Academic research on the Pooshee Plantation and Woodboo Plantation in South Carolina, showed a continued belief of African water spirits among enslaved African Americans. Both plantations are ""now under the waters of Lake Moultrie."" The earliest known record of simbi spirits was recorded in the nineteenth century by Edmund Ruffin who was a wealthy slaveholder from Virginia, and traveled to South Carolina ""to keep the slave economic system viable through agricultural reform.""
""At Pooshee plantation on the Santee Canal not too far from Woodboo, Ruffin stated that a young slave boy went to a fountain for water late at night and was very frightened by a cymbee (Simbi water spirit) who was running around and around the fountain. Although few witnesses to the appearance of cymbees were found by Ruffin, he stated that they are generally believed by the slaves to be frequent and numerous. Part of the superstition was that it was bad luck for anyone who saw one to 'tell of the occurrence, or refer to it; and that his death would be the certain penalty, if he told of the meeting for some weeks afterwards."" Another occurrence from an enslaved man said simbi spirits have long hair.

Sukey and The Mermaid
In Black American folklore, the Gullah Geechee people in the Carolina Lowcountry have a children's story called Sukey and the Mermaid about a girl named Sukey meeting a mermaid named Mama Jo. Mama Jo in the story helps and protects Sukey and financially supported her by giving her gold coins. This story comes from the belief in Simbi spirits in Central Africa that came to the United States during the Atlantic slave trade. In Africa, Simbi nature spirits protect and provide riches to their followers. In Central Africa, there are folk stories of people meeting mermaids.

Haitian Vodou
The belief in bisimbi also exists in the traditional spiritual practices of Haiti. While Haitian Vodou has been known for its West African influences, primarily those from Benin and Nigeria, it also contains Central African influences from the Congo Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Angola in the form of bisimbi. Though often referred to as lwa, bisimbi such as Mami Wata, Nsimba and Nzuzi are still nlongo, or sacred, in traditional Haitian spirituality and culture.

Palo
In an Afro-Cuban religion called Palo, bisimbi are called Nkitas. They are deities of all aspects of nature, such as lakes, forests or mountains.

In culture
Governor General Michaëlle Jean of Canada, who was born in Haiti, bears two simbi serpents as supporters on her coat of arms.

Traditional accounts describe them as powerful sorcerers who, after engaging in various nefarious acts, gain the ability to transform into animals at will.

Background
In the Navajo language, yee naaldlooshii translates to ""by means of it, it goes on all fours"". While perhaps the most common variety seen in horror fiction by non-Navajo people, the yee naaldlooshii is one of several varieties of skin-walkers in Navajo culture; specifically, they are a type of 'ánti'įhnii.
Navajo witches, including skin-walkers, represent the antithesis of Navajo cultural values. While community healers and cultural workers are known as medicine men and women, or by other positive terms in the community's Indigenous language, witches are seen as evil, performing harmful ceremonies and manipulative magic in a perversion of the good works medicine people traditionally perform. In order to practice their good works, traditional healers may learn about both good and evil magic, in order to protect against evil. But people who choose to become witches are seen as corrupt.
The legend of the skin-walkers is not well understood outside of Navajo culture, both due to reluctance to discuss the subject with outsiders, as well as what Cherokee Nation academic Adrienne Keene says is a lack of the necessary cultural context the stories are embedded within. Traditional Navajo people are reluctant to reveal skin-walker lore to non-Navajos, or to discuss it at all among those they do not trust. Keene, founder of the website Native Appropriations, has written in response to non-Navajos incorporating the legends into their writing (and specifically the impact when J. K. Rowling did so) that when this is done, ""We as Native people are now opened up to a barrage of questions about these beliefs and traditions ... but these are not things that need or should be discussed by outsiders. At all. I'm sorry if that seems 'unfair', but that's how our cultures survive.""

Legend
Animals associated with witchcraft usually include tricksters such as the coyote; however, it may include other creatures, usually those associated with death or bad omens. They might also possess living animals or people and walk around in their bodies. Skin-walkers may be male or female.
Skin-walker stories told among Navajo children may be complete life and death struggles that end in either skin-walker or Navajo killing the other, or partial encounter stories that end in a stalemate. Encounter stories may be composed as Navajo victory stories, with the skin-walkers approaching a hogan and being scared away.
Non-Native interpretations of skin-walker stories typically take the form of partial encounter stories on the road, where the protagonist is temporarily vulnerable, but then escapes from the skin-walker in a way not traditionally seen in Navajo stories.  Sometimes Navajo children take European folk stories and substitute skin-walkers for generic killers like The Hook.

The majority of mainstream scientists have historically discounted the existence of the skunk ape, considering it to be the result of a combination of folklore, misidentification, and hoax, rather than a living animal. The skunk ape has entered the popular culture of the southern United States, especially in Florida.

Description
The skunk ape is commonly described as a bipedal human or ape-like creature, approximately 1.5–2.1 m (5–7 feet) tall, and covered in mottled reddish-brown hair. The skunk ape is often reported to be smaller in stature compared to traditional descriptions of Bigfoot from the northern United States and Canada. It is named for its foul odor, often described as being similar to that of a skunk.

History
Contemporary descriptions of the skunk ape in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama folklore have occurred since European settlers first occupied the region. In 1818, local newspapers reported a story from what is now Apalachicola, Florida, that spoke of a ""man-sized monkey"" raiding food stores and stalking fishermen along the shore. Cryptozoologists have made unsubstantiated claims that Seminole and Miccosukee culture includes stories of a foul-smelling, physically powerful, and secretive creature called Esti Capcaki, a name which roughly translates to ""Furry Tall Man"" or ""Hairy Giant"".

Notable alleged sightings
In 1929, an alleged sighting occurred at the famous and then recently constructed Perky Bat Tower at the Florida Keys. Witnesses reported that an unknown ape-like creature was drawn to the construction site. After inspecting the bat tower shortly after it had been stocked with bats, the creature shook the tower, driving off the bats before running off into the woods.
In 1942, a man in Suwanee County reported a similar creature rushing out from the brush line while he was driving down an isolated road. It was alleged to have grabbed onto his vehicle and beat on the running board and door for half a mile before departing. In the small community of Bardin, in Putnam County, Florida, beginning in the 1940s, there were a number of alleged sightings of a creature that came to be known as the Bardin Booger. In the 1960s, a rash of sightings in central Florida happened around Alachua County and Marion County. One such report from 1963 involved several members of a family encountering an ape-like creature around their rural home, including one instance of it approaching a window to peer inside at night. 
Reports of the skunk ape were particularly common in the 1950s through the 1970s. The Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization has archived hundreds of alleged sightings across almost every county of Florida, beginning in 1955 into the present day.
In the 1970s, two Palm Beach County sheriff's deputies named Marvin Lewis and Ernie Milner reported that an ape-like creature stalked them through a grove before they shot at it with their firearms. They reported following a trail of footprints where they recovered hair snagged on a barbed wire fence line that had been pushed down. In 1971 to 1975, a rash of sightings occurred in Broward County and surrounding areas. Multiple eyewitnesses reported nocturnal encounters with a 5 to 7 foot (1.5–2.1 meter) ape-like creature with dark red to black fur. These events were heavily covered in newspapers, both local and in other Florida cities such as Miami, and were some of the earliest instances popularizing the term ""Skunk Ape"" in the state lexicon. Reports alleged that the skunk ape had invaded homes, stalked people, and killed several of a farmer's livestock including a horse and a bull. The local police department investigated after one law enforcement officer reported striking the skunk ape with his car. Posses were formed in an effort to locate the alleged creature, but no body or evidence was found.
In 1977, a failed-to-pass bill was proposed to the Florida state legislature to make it illegal to ""take, possess, harm or molest anthropoids or humanoid animals"".
Several Everglades wildlife tour bus operators and their guests have reported alleged sightings. In July 1997, one such operator, David Shealy, reported wildlife bait stands laden with lima bean had been raided and he noticed strange tracks surrounding them. He baited several locations with more lima beans and multiple witnesses reported skunk ape sightings soon after. Shealy and others attributed this instance to high seasonal flooding having driven numerous animals into tighter ranges around higher ground. One such sighting was by Everglades tour operators Steve Goodbread and Dow Rowland; some of their guests reported skunk ape sightings as well. Both operators claimed that 38 °C (100 °F) weather, high humidity, and the rural location would make a hoax unlikely.
In 1997, a photograph of a dark upright figure in the swamp was taken by Ochopee Fire Control District Chief Vince Doerr that he claims depicts a skunk ape. He reported observing the creature cross the road, and stopped his car to capture a photograph. Within two weeks, over fifty people reported alleged sightings of a hairy creature within the Big Cypress National Preserve.
In the year 2000, the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office received two anonymous photos depicting a large, hairy, ape-like creature. The author of the letter claimed to be an elderly woman who reported the creature had been stealing apples from her back porch near I-75, and upon surprising it with a camera she was afraid it was an escaped orangutan that might harm her family. The scrutinized photos, dubbed the ""Myakka skunk ape,"" remain a polarizing topic and their authenticity remains debated. One critique highlighting the photographs as a potential hoax is the subject's resemblance to a Bigfoot statue known from a Ripley's Believe It or Not! museum. However, the position, expression, and posture of the creature changes in both photos adding doubts to it being a hoax.
Sightings continue to the present day, with forty-eight out of sixty-seven counties in Florida reporting sightings since 2010.

Proposed explanations
Most anecdotal reports and alleged visual evidence are deemed to be fabrication or hoaxes. Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell has written that some of the reports may represent sightings of the Florida black bear, possibly some suffering from mange, and it is likely that other sightings are hoaxes or general misidentification of wildlife. The United States National Park Service considers the skunk ape to be a hoax.

In popular culture
The skunk ape has been widely adopted across Florida as an unofficial mascot for wilderness and rural culture, including appearing in roadside businesses and attractions, television commercials, and on signs. During the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Orlando's Gatorland park used the skunk ape's reported foul smell to promote social distancing.
The skunk ape is often the subject of conferences that host guest speakers, research presentations, trail running events, and vendors.

Later reports would expand on sightings encompassing an area to include  Central Maryland; Berkeley County, West Virginia; and the Washington, DC, metro area.

History
18th century
The area of Frederick County, Maryland was settled by German immigrants beginning in the 1730s. Early accounts describe the community being terrorized by a monster called a Schneller Geist, meaning ""quick ghost"" in German. The earliest incarnations of the creature mixed the half-bird features of a siren with the nightmarish features of demons and ghouls. The snallygaster was described as half-reptile, half-bird having a metallic beak lined with razor-sharp teeth, occasionally alongside octopus-like tentacles. The snallygaster was rumored to swoop silently from the sky to pick up and carry off its victims. The earliest stories claim that this monster sucked the blood of its victims. Seven-pointed stars, which reputedly kept the snallygaster at bay, can still be seen painted on local barns.

19th century
It has been suggested the legend was resurrected in the 19th century to frighten freed slaves.

20th century
Newspaper accounts throughout February and March 1909 describe encounters between local residents and a beast with ""enormous wings, a long pointed bill, claws like steel hooks, and an eye in the center of its forehead."" It was described as making screeches ""like a locomotive whistle."" A great deal of publicity surrounded this string of appearances, with the Smithsonian Institution offering a reward for the hide. U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt reportedly considered postponing an African safari to personally hunt the beast. It was later revealed that these reports were part of a hoax perpetrated by Middletown Valley Register editor George C. Rhoderick and reporter Ralph S. Wolfe in an attempt to increase readership. The descriptions they invented borrowed themes from existing German folklore, including dragon-like creatures who snatched children and livestock, and also appeared to invoke descriptions of the Jersey Devil, which had been spotted mere weeks earlier.

On June 22, 1953, Whittaker Chambers (whose home lies in Carroll County, Maryland) used the snallygaster to examine U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy in his essay ""Is Academic Freedom in Danger?"" (Life ):  It was a trick of fate in a low comedy mood that Senator McCarthy should first have bounded into public view dragging the unlikely and protesting person of Mr. Lattimore to share with him a historic spotlight so grateful to the one and so acutely unwanted by the other.  It was a trick of fate that, in the case of each, has led to some serious confusions.  For it led to the translation of Senator McCarthy into the symbol of a national snallygaster (a winged hobgoblin used to frighten naughty children in parts of rural Maryland), instead of one of the two things that he obviously is:  an instinctive politician of a kind fairly common in our history, in which case the uproar he inspires is a phenomenon much more arresting than the senator; or a politician of a kind wholly new in our history, in which case he merits the most cautious and coldblooded appraisal.

In popular culture
The snallygaster appears as a boss fight in Blair Witch Volume II: The Legend of Coffin Rock, which takes place in 1886.
In 2008, author Patrick Boyton published a history of the snallygaster, entitled Snallygaster: the Lost Legend of Frederick County.
In 2011 an annual beer festival (a ""beastly beer jamboree"") called ""Snallygaster"" started in Washington, DC.
The 2017 edition of J. K. Rowling's Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them incorporated the Snallygaster into her Harry Potter universe. It is described as a part-bird, part-reptile relative of the Occamy, with serrated steel fangs, a bulletproof hide, and a natural sense of curiosity.
A creature called a snallygaster appears in the 2018 Bethesda game Fallout 76. It bears little resemblance to the creature of legend and is described in the game as a failed genetic experiment.
The Snallygaster is a Blended Whiskey produced by Dragon Distillery of Frederick, MD and released in 2018.
South Mountain Creamery, a dairy farm located in Frederick County, Maryland, produces an ice cream flavor named Snallygaster. It consists of peanut butter flavored ice cream with caramel swirl, peanut butter cups, and pretzels.
In 2021 Sarah Cooper, a cryptozoologist in Maryland, opened The American Snallygaster Museum in Libertytown, MD.

U'tlun'ta is Cherokee for ""the one with the pointed spear”. Her right forefinger resembles a spear or obsidian knife, which she uses to cut her victims. Her mouth is stained with blood from the livers she has eaten. She is also known as Nûñ'yunu'ï, which means ""Stone-dress"", for her stone-like skin. Often she clutches her right hand tightly, because she is hiding her heart and her only weak spot, which is her right palm.
Spearfinger, being made of stone, sounds like thunder when she walks, crushing rocks into the ground when she steps on them. Her voice echoes down the mountains to the Cherokee villages and scares the birds of the forest away, which the people have traditionally seen as a warning sign.
In Tennessee, Spearfinger is believed to enjoy walking the trail that joins Chilhowee Mountain and the nearby Little Tennessee River. She is said to have also walked throughout the mountain range, around streams, and through shadowy Nantahala River passes. The Cherokee say her favorite home is Whiteside, a thunder mountain.

Powers
Besides a spear for a finger, she shapeshifts into family members of her child victims. Once she has made herself a part of her victim's world, she lacks the ability to change her form while still in anyone else's sight. Spearfinger often disguises herself in the form of ""a harmless old lady"", as in the story, ""U`tlûñ'ta, The Spear-finger"".
Since she is made from stone, arrows cannot pierce her skin. They shatter when they hit her. Furthermore, she can pick up boulders effortlessly, stack them, break them, and morph them together.

Her stone structure
Once, Spearfinger undertook to build a ""great rock bridge through the air from Nûñyû'-tlu`gûñ'yï, the 'Tree rock', on Hiwassee, over to Sanigilâ'gï,"" which is Whiteside Mountain located on the Blue Ridge. This structure irritated the Higher Beings because it came too close to their Upper World. Higher Beings saw her effort as arrogant ""like  man's Bible story of Babel"", so they struck it with lightning.
In the nineteenth century, Cherokee pointed out the location where they claim the ruins of Spearfinger's ""Tree Rock"" remain even today. They named the area along the mountain ""Hiawassee"" and valley ""Nantahala"". The site of these remains in Blount County is called ""U'Tluntun'yi"", which means ""The Spearfinger Place"".

Her enemy - Stone Man
Another mountain legend concerning stone beings tells of Nun'Yunu'Wi/Stone Man. When Stone Man and Spearfinger pass each other, they sense their relation. Cherokee legend says the stone beings know they are enemies because they hunt the same food – livers. Spearfinger recognises the other figure to be a man because he sings his song about livers in a lower voice that shakes the ground.
Instead of needing to lift stones to build, Stone Man possesses stronger powers than Spearfinger. He simply uses his staff to create bridges to other mountains.

Stories and customs
In autumn, Cherokee peoples have traditionally burned brush fires. These brush fires have covered entire mountainsides so that the Cherokee could easily hunt the fallen, roasted chestnuts. Spearfinger is known for being attracted to these fires. In other seasons, Spearfinger searches for the clouds of smoke that rise from the valley. Sometimes she has caught victims when they wandered for a drink at a stream or picked strawberries near the village.
Her most dangerous attribute is deception - appearing harmless and trustworthy, hiding her identity and powers while luring unsuspecting children. As in the story, ""U`tlûñ'ta, The Spear-finger"":

Sometimes an old woman would approach along the trail where the children were picking strawberries or playing near the village, and would say to them coaxingly, ""Come, my grandchildren, come to your granny and let granny dress your hair."" When some little girl ran up and laid her head in the old woman's lap to be petted and combed the old witch would gently run her fingers through the child's hair until it went to sleep, when she would stab the little one through the heart or back of the neck with the long awl finger, which she had kept hidden under her robe. Then she would take out the liver and eat it.
The Cherokee have traditionally been very cautious about strangers, and were suspicious of those who wandered off alone. They could come back as the liver-eater in disguise.
There are many tales of her deception, including her trick of turning into her victim, hiding the body, and going into the victim's home to wait until the parents left or the family was asleep to take all their livers. Parents warned children not to go into the forest alone because Spearfinger waited for them and made sure they knew she would appear as ""grandmother or [their] favorite aunt"".
Hunters alone in the woods used to see an old woman with a strangely-shaped hand. She would sing her haunting song, so frightening them that they would hasten back to their villages as quietly as they could. The Cherokee claim that Spearfinger stabs her victims ""in the back of their neck or through their heart, drawing out their livers. Spearfinger's attack is very quick. When she steals livers, her finger does not leave a scar, and victims do not feel the wound. Several days after the unnoticed attack, the victims become ill and die.""

Death of Spearfinger
The Cherokee called a great council, including Tomotley, Tenase, Setico, and Chota towns, which were haunted by the liver eater. The medicine man, adawehis, explained the Spearfinger's deception and how to attract her. They knew about her finger because they saw her dancing on ""ledges of Sanigilagi"". They just did not know how to kill her, but the medicine man said they might get lucky. Following advice of the medicine man, the people set a trap for Spearfinger by digging a pit and covering it with brush. They made a fire with green saplings, which made a vast amount of smoke rise into the air. Spearfinger saw the smoke from Chilhowee Mountain and ran to the village, crushing the ground as she walked. She approached hiding her right hand with a blanket.
When they saw her as an old woman, the hunter hesitated thinking she was one of their own or from a neighboring village. She called to them for help as she walked, but the medicine man knew her trick. He threw his spear first, which broke into pieces when it hit her. The rest of the hunters began to attack, seeing through her disguise. Her skin deflected the arrows.
Spearfinger revealed her covered hand, ran towards the men, and fell into their pit. She was unharmed, though, by the stakes, and ""swatted at the arrows as though they were irksome gnats."" Finding herself trapped in the pit, she slashed her finger in every direction trying to catch someone and taunted them with her song about eating livers.
Birds flew down from the sky as ""celestial beings"" to aid the Cherokee. A bird called Utsu'`gï, a titmouse, flew to the hunting party and sang ""un, un, un."" This sounded like u-nahu, which means ""heart"", so they aimed for her chest. When the arrows failed to kill her, they caught the titmouse and cut off its tongue. Ever since then, whenever people see the titmouse’s short tongue, they  are reminded that it's a liar. It was not that the bird lied on purpose, but that he ""simply was not specific enough."" After that, the titmouse flew into the sky, returning to the Upper World. It would never return.
Then, a chickadee, Tsï'kïlilï', finally came and landed on her right hand, the one with the spear, and the hunters viewed that as an omen to shoot for the hand she kept double-fisted.  She became even more upset and scared at this. Hitting her where the wrist and right hand joined or, some say, where the Spearfinger joined the wrist, they severed her heart. She sank to the ground, and her finger ""twitched and was still."" The curse of Spearfinger, the liver eater, ended.
Stone Man, her other liver-eating friend, heard the victorious cheers and later saw her right hand with the spear on a post beside the village. He considered himself warned. Knowing his own weakness, Stone Man shrugged the warning off because no one knew it yet. He continued to sing his song of war, livers, and hunting.
In recognition of the help which the chickadee gave to the hunters in their hour of need, the bird has ever afterward been known as the ""truth teller"" and, if ever it should perch near the house of a man who is away hunting, this is taken as a sign that the hunter will return safely from his trip. 
Despite her death, Cherokee story-tellers continue to tell the legend of Spearfinger and point out the place where her stone structure fell down.

In Pop Culture
Spearfinger is the hidden antagonist in the movie ""The Hike"" (2021). In the movie, her spirit is freed and starts growing in power when it is disturbed by an unsuspecting couple hiking in the Great Smoky Mountains. Her spirit looks for a new body, and eventually takes over a female hiker after Spearfinger orchestrates the elaborate death of four strangers. In the film, she kills people by throwing rocks, knocking down trees, appearing as loved ones and stabbing people with her obsidian finger. She also appears as a young female hiker, and seduces a man to his demise in a hidden cave. This movie was made by Big N Funky Productions, the same group that has made an episode of Wrestling With Ghosts where they try to find Spearfinger on the Nolan Creek Trail.

Reports of Tessie date back to the mid-19th century, and over time, the creature has become a well-known part of local folklore.

History
One of the earliest accounts of a large creature in Lake Tahoe comes from 1865, when I.C. Coggin, a socialite from San Francisco, reported seeing a massive serpent-like creature. He described it as having a head 14 feet wide and a body stretching over 600 feet. 
In the 1980s, multiple reports of an unidentified creature in Lake Tahoe emerged from witnesses, including hikers, an optician, and local law enforcement. They described a large, dark figure moving beneath the water’s surface, often creating a noticeable wake. One hiker claimed to have seen a creature ""as big as a rowboat,"" with whitecaps forming around what appeared to be its mouth.
In the 1980s, Mike Conway, a local TV station owner, reported seeing a humped creature during a commercial shoot at Zephyr Cove. He claimed several children shouted ""It’s Tessie!"" when the water began to rock unexpectedly. However, Conway stated that the footage was later destroyed.
In 2005, Mickey Daniels, a longtime Lake Tahoe fisherman and former sheriff's officer, described seeing a large V-shaped wave cutting through the lake's calm waters, which he believed was not caused by any known fish or boat. Around the same time, visitors Ron Talmage and Beth Douglas reported seeing a dark shape with multiple humps approximately 100 yards from shore at Tahoe Park Beach. Although no photographic evidence was obtained, the sighting contributed to the ongoing accounts of strange shapes moving through the lake.

Washoe influence
The legend of Tahoe Tessie is often connected to the beliefs of the Washoe people, who spoke of Water Babies, powerful spirits said to inhabit the lake, particularly around Cave Rock. These beings were believed to have the power to harm those who spoke of them. Other Washoe legends include Ong, a giant bird that was said to have kidnapped children. According to Washoe legend, a young man who strayed too far from his camp was captured by Ong (Washoe folklore) and taken to its nest. The man used shards of obsidian to kill the bird and escape by crafting a boat from one of its wings.
Although some claim that Tessie has roots in Washoe culture, the current form of the legend dates primarily to the 20th century. Tessie's modern appearance is often compared to that of Nessie from Loch Ness, and sightings have been regularly reported since the early 1900s. While some believe in the creature, others see her as a playful figure, often explained away as a giant sturgeon. Tessie is a prominent figure in local art, signs, logos, and a children’s book series.

Theories and ecosystem
Several theories have been proposed to explain the sightings of Tahoe Tessie. One prominent theory suggests that the creature could be a giant sturgeon, a prehistoric-looking fish known to grow to large sizes. Sturgeons are bottom-feeders and have been found in other deep lakes, making them a plausible explanation for the large, dark figures reported in Lake Tahoe.
Another theory points to natural phenomena. Dr. Charles Goldman of the UC Davis Tahoe Research Group has suggested that many sightings of Tessie, particularly those describing humps or waves, could be caused by wind patterns or water movements creating illusions of large creatures on the lake’s surface.
It has also been speculated that large goldfish, introduced into the lake by pet owners, could be responsible for some sightings of unusual shapes moving beneath the surface. The lake’s depths, which reach over 1,645 feet, provide an environment where something large could potentially remain hidden. Its ecosystem, which includes fish like rainbow trout and kokanee salmon, could support a large predator that remains undetected in such vast, deep waters.
In 2022, a year-long project conducted by divers and volunteers, led by the nonprofit group Clean Up the Lake, removed more than 25,000 pounds of underwater litter from Lake Tahoe's 72-mile shoreline. While no evidence of Tahoe Tessie was uncovered, the divers found various debris such as bottles, tires, fishing gear, and shipwreck planks near Dead Man’s Point—a location tied to local legends of the lake monster.

Cultural impact
By the late 20th century, Tessie had become a more lighthearted figure in local culture, often depicted as a friendly dragon. This version was popularized by Bob McCormick’s children's book series in the 1980s. McCormick also trademarked ""The Original Tahoe Lake Monster"" and created several Tessie costumes for festivals and public appearances. He operated a gift shop in Kings Beach based around the lake monster for about seven years, selling approximately 110,000 copies of his book. McCormick has also expressed interest in writing another book involving the Washoe legend of Ong.
In 2021, Tessie was featured on Fox Nation's show Monsters Across America, where the episode focused on local legends and cryptid sightings in Lake Tahoe. That same year, Tessie became the mascot for an anti-litter campaign titled ""Love Our Lake,"" which used the slogan ""Don’t mess with Tessie"" to encourage environmental stewardship.
In 2023, the ECHL's new hockey team, the Tahoe Knight Monsters, was named after the folklore surrounding Tessie. The team, co-owned by former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow and businessman David Hodges, adopted a dragon-like creature for its logo, drawing inspiration from local folklore. The team’s colors—teal, black, and gold—were chosen to reflect the lake and surrounding mountains. The team will begin competing in the 2024-25 season in the ECHL's Mountain Division, alongside teams like the Idaho Steelheads, Utah Grizzlies, and Kansas City Mavericks.

Alternate names include Taileybone, Taileybones, Tailbones, Tallie Tale, Taily Po, Taileypo and Tailipoe.","Tailypo is a creature of North American folklore, particularly in Appalachia. Alternate names include Taileybone, Taileybones, Tailbones, Tallie Tale, Taily Po, Taileypo and Tailipoe.

Creature
The Tailypo is usually said to be the size of a dog. Depending on the storyteller, it has yellow or red eyes, a long tail, and pointed and/or tufted ears like a bobcat. It is nocturnal, covered in dark fur to blend into its environment. It only attacks with its claws, suggesting it is not a ""versatile"" demon or spirit, but it can and does speak in some form of English, meaning it can't simply be an animal.
It speaks some English, demanding the return of its tail (the actual phrase varies from version to version, but always repeats).

Setting
The story is almost always set at night in a heavily wooded rural area. Geographically the setting is accepted to be somewhere in the American South. The events could feasibly occur at any time period, given the isolation and atmosphere of the tale.
The main events occur in a log cabin deep in the woods where a hermit and his three dogs live.

Story
During a season of considerable hunger and a lack of suitable game, the tale begins with a hermit and his three hounds. The man is out at night, looking for the evening meal, and manages to shoot a small hare, which he shares with his dogs. Understandably still hungry, the man presses on and discovers a bizarre shape with bright eyes and a long tail. The hermit quickly shoots at the creature, severing its tail. Screaming, the creature runs off into the darkness and the man eats the tail, either raw or in stew.
On the brink of sleep, a rustling and clawing wakes the man. Sitting up, the hermit is able to see the gleaming eyes of the Tailypo leering at him from the foot of his bed. In an otherworldly voice, the creature demands the return of its ""tailypo"". Terrified, the man calls for his hounds, which immediately come to his aid, chasing the beast off into the night.
With the creature chased back into the woods, two of the hermit's dogs return, but one remains missing. The man tries to sleep, but the Tailypo soon returns, beckoning even more forcefully for the return of its tail. Again, the man sics his hounds on the Tailypo, and again, one is missing upon the return of the survivor. Unable to sleep, the man clutches his weapon (usually a gun of some kind) and waits for dawn, his remaining dog nearby. When the Tailypo appears for the third time, the man once again orders the hound to attack the Tailypo. Predictably, the dog chases the creature away and does not return.
The man, now left with no real protection, having exhausted his three hounds, cowers under his bedsheets, praying for dawn. Hours before daybreak, the man hears the familiar rustling sound, hoping that it is one of his dogs. Unfortunately, the man is leapt upon by the Tailypo and is either disarmed or has dropped his weapon in terror. The beast is now eye-to-eye with the man, and it demands once more the return of his ""tailypo"".
Most commonly, the man is described as being flayed beyond recognition by the Tailypo. In less explicit versions, all that remains of the cabin is the chimney. Either way, it is understood that the Tailypo has exacted revenge for the loss of its tail. During the darkest of nights, the creature can be heard whispering for its ""tailypo"" (or claiming, whisperingly, that it has gotten its ""tailypo"" back).

Variations
The Tailypo legend has countless variations, many of which are passed down orally. The theme of a hungry man and his dogs hunting for food by their old cabin is constant. However, the methods used by the man to defend himself vary from axes to rifles. Also, the man's dogs sometimes simply get ""lost"" or just flee in fright, instead of being eaten or killed by the Tailypo. Sometimes, the dogs chase the creature into a swamp and then disappear, with the suggestion that they were lured into the swamp to be killed. In some variants, the Tailypo does actually enter the cabin through a hole in the floor, as opposed to being found in the woods. The season is accepted to be late Autumn but this too varies. Usually, these variations depend most heavily on the target audiences, with grisly embellishments removed for younger listeners. In some versions, the man's dogs are named (in order of disappearance) Uno, Ino, and Cumptico-Calico.

Analysis
The legend has been described as revolving around common anxieties for rural families in Appalachia, such as the fear of isolation or famine.  It can also be seen as a cautionary tale, teaching children not to abuse animals.

Reports
The Tuttle Bottoms Monster legend is familiar to generations of Saline County residents. Former Harrisburg Police Chief Gary Crabtree told the Harrisburg Daily Register that his department received approximately 50 reports over 28 years of an unidentified beast in the area northwest of Harrisburg, some reporting a creature with two legs and some with four. Most described it as having a long, almost anteater-like snout.
On August 6, 1963, The Harrisburg Daily Register reported what seemed to be the first report of the creature.

""Saline County Sheriff James L. Thompson spent a busy night last night, starting about 11 p.m. and ending about 4:30 a.m. The Sheriff said he ran across a youth at Tuttle Bottoms about 11 p.m. The young man was armed with a rifle and told Thompson that there was a monster loose in the bottoms. He said it was eight feet long, four feet high and had a nose like an anteater. The young man put his rifle in his car and left, and later Thompson ran across about a dozen boys, armed with shotguns and other weapons and all looking for the “monster” in the bottoms. Their Sheriff soon dispersed the boys and sent them home.""
A local resident named Virgil Smith told the Register he believes the creature is not a monster out of myth but was an actual animal ""released by the federal government"" that has long since died. Smith said the creature was a hairy primate, stood on two legs, and was not scared of humans, adding that one couple reported the animal walked right up to them. Smith also claims that a former employee of the U.S. Department of Agriculture confided to him that the department had launched a private investigation into the Tuttle Bottoms Monster.
The earliest reports of the creature date to the 1960s by teenagers who used the area as a local ""make-out"" spot and by hunters who would make frantic calls to the police after seeing the creature. It was rumored that some murders took place in the Bottoms during that time.

The name originates from the legendary alligator having lost all but two toes on one or more feet to a steel trap.,"Two-Toed Tom is a legendary alligator in the Southern United States who terrorized swamp residents in Florida and Alabama. The name originates from the legendary alligator having lost all but two toes on one or more feet to a steel trap.

Origins
The story of Two-Toed Tom originated in the 1920s, at least as early as 1922, according to an anecdote by Esto, Florida councilman Ralph Dupree, born in 1912, who said that he had heard the story ""since he was 10 years old"". One of the earliest written accounts can be traced to the 1934 book Stars Fell on Alabama, by Carl Carmer. In the book, the story of Two-Toed Tom, often referred to simply as Two-Toe or Red-Eye, refers to a red-eyed, 14-foot alligator who would regularly eat farmers livestock as well as men and women, the latter of which he was also said to have raped before eating. The story continues to tell of multiple failed attempts to kill the alligator, including an ex-military sharpshooter who spent over a week in a hunting blind, waiting for the creature, and another incident where the alligator was chased into a pond by farmer Pap Haines, into which 15 syrup buckets of dynamite were lit and thrown into, in an unsuccessful attempt to kill Two-Toe. The story ends with it being mentioned the gator was said to have made his way down to Florida, though the narrator, an old man named Gilmore, believed he'd be back to Alabama eventually.
Other sources attest that Two-Toed Tom, after leaving Alabama, took up residence in the Sand Hammock Lake, between Esto, Florida and Noma, Florida. In a chapter dedicated to the legend in the book Holmesteading by E.W. Carswell, it's described that the creature continued to frequently eat livestock, and would also bellow in response to the whistle at the Alabama-Florida Lumber Company mill in Noma. Further failed attempts at killing Two-Toed Tom are described here as well, with a group of local boys shooting at it with .22 caliber rifles and shotguns, to no effect.
Two-Toed Tom arises again in 1972, when an article in the Pensacola News Journal reported that two-toed tracks had been found on Boynton Island, near the community of Red Head, Florida.

Two-Toed Tom Festival
Starting in 1987, a festival has been held in Esto, Florida dedicated to Two-Toed Tom, however as of 2019, its future has been called into question, due to a lack of support.

In popular culture
Two-Toed Tom is mentioned briefly in Go Set a Watchman by Harper Lee.
Toe-Toed Tom is featured in the videogame South of Midnight, where Hazel and a big talking catfish encounter him while searching for Hazel's mother. It is depicted as a ginormous albino alligator with an island attached to his back, in order to distract Tom, Hazel must ring the bell of an abandoned church in order to get past him.

Description
Different accounts offer wide-ranging descriptions of the creature. One of the earliest and most famous accounts by a local man named J.A. Johnson described an animal that was dull grey or brown and similar to an alligator, but much larger and heavier with a horn between its eyes and nostrils. Johnson and two others claimed to see the monster from twenty yards away and the men estimated the creature to be about forty feet long. Other reported sightings claim that the creature was similar to a very large catfish or mudpuppy. The Nebraska State Historical Society reports that contemporary accounts believed Johnson actually saw an unusually large beaver. Some legends also say that it is a giant, horned beast resembling an alligator that eats livestock and ducks.

Legend and legacy
The original legend of the Walgren Lake Monster claimed to be corroborated by Native American accounts of a similar beast inhabiting the lake. The initial story of a lake monster which devoured livestock sparked curiosity throughout Nebraska and abroad, even reaching the London Times. According to some articles published at the time, unsuccessful efforts were made to capture the monster.
In her 1935 biography Old Jules, Mari Sandoz mentioned the monster and its notoriety. Sandoz claimed local fundamentalist Christians believed that the monster was created by Satan to test the faith of locals: ""The same devil that scattered the fossil bones over the earth to confound those of little faith could plant a sea monster among the sinners"".
As time went on, the legend of the monster evolved to include the supposed supernatural abilities of the creature. The July 1938 issue of the Federal Writers Project in Nebraska's Tall Tales monthly publication offered a description of the monster's massive size, which reportedly caused the earth to tremble whenever he moved such that ""the farmers become seasick for miles around"". The article went on to claim that the monster came ashore daily to eat large numbers of livestock and in doing so created a thick, green mist which disoriented travelers in the area.
The January 1962 edition of Outdoor Nebraska repeated the story as recorded in the 1938 telling, specifically corroborating the disorienting fog. The 1962 article exaggerates the claims of the 1938 story further by claiming a group of ""eastern innocents"" had fallen victim to the creature's earth-shaking and had been bounced from Hay Springs to Valentine, over one hundred miles away.
The legend of the Walgren Lake Monster was likely created and distributed by John G. Maher, a Nebraska politician and newspaperman, as a sensational story to sell more newspapers. Maher is known for several other hoaxes perpetrated in Nebraska, such as burying a cement casting of a Buffalo Soldier in an archeological site near Chadron and proclaiming it a ""petrified man"", sinking bags of soda in a hot spring and reporting on the healing properties of the ""soda springs"", and warning that the British Navy was sailing up the Mississippi and Missouri rivers to punish Irish immigrants who supported the Irish Republic. Regardless of the probable hoax, the village of Hay Springs has embraced the monster as a local symbol, selling commemorative shirts and buttons as well as creating a replica of the monster based on Johnson's original description out of green flotation material.

These entities are believed to inhabit bodies of water such as springs, ponds, and streams, often appearing as infants whose cries are considered an omen of impending disaster. In some traditions, they are described as small creatures who lure people to their deaths and are said to eat children.

Tribal variations
Water Babies are recognized in the folklore of various tribes, each with its own interpretation and cultural significance. Tribes that feature Water Babies in their folklore include the Paiute, Shoshone, Washoe, Achumawi, Cahuilla, Cupeño, Luiseño, Serrano, Yokuts, Salish, and Ute.

Washoe Beliefs
In Washoe tradition, Water Babies are considered powerful beings that inhabit bodies of water in their homeland, particularly around Lake Tahoe in California and Nevada. These spirits were believed to be capable of causing harm or even death to humans. Cave Rock, located at the southern end of Lake Tahoe, was regarded as a sacred place by the Washoe, in part due to the presence of Water Babies in the cave. Only healers were allowed to visit this site for spiritual renewal, where they would consult with the Water Babies and bring them offerings in hopes of strengthening their powers.
Before crossing the lake or fishing, the Washoe performed rituals involving specific offerings to the Water Babies. These offerings included corn, bread, and pine nuts, which were placed in baskets sealed with pitch and submerged into the lake. The Washoe believed these offerings would protect them from drowning or ensure they caught many fish. When tribespeople did not return from the lake, it was thought that the Water Babies were responsible for their deaths by drowning.

Paiute Beliefs
Paiute legends, particularly those surrounding Pyramid Lake in Nevada, include stories of Water Babies as mysterious and dangerous spirits. These spirits are said to mimic the sounds of crying babies to lure in victims. Some versions of the legend suggest that malformed or premature infants were cast into the waters, while another version tells of a curse placed on the lake by a rejected mermaid. The sounds of crying babies are said to be heard from the lake on certain nights, a reminder of the spirits believed to dwell beneath its surface.
In another Paiute tale from the Owens Valley in California, Water Babies are depicted as spirits inhabiting Owens Lake. In one story, a Water Baby confronts a giant who terrorizes the area. The Water Baby waits for the giant near the lake, ultimately overpowering and drowning him in the lake’s depths. The remains of the giant are said to still be visible near the Alabama Hills, marking the Water Baby's triumph.
In the Delamar Valley SEZ (Solar Energy Zone) of Nevada, Water Babies are recognized as powerful spirits connected to water and volcanic areas by the Southern Paiute tribes, including the Moapa Band of Paiute Indians, the Pahrump Paiute Tribe, and the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah. These beings are believed to travel through underground waterways, which are considered to be connected to other significant bodies of water across the region. Petroglyphs and rock art in the Delamar Valley depict Water Babies, reflecting their importance in local spiritual practices and ceremonies.

Ute Beliefs
In Ute folklore, particularly among those around Utah Lake and the Provo River in Utah, Water Babies, known as Pawapicts, were believed to inhabit these waters. The Utes told stories of these spirits, often describing them as small creatures with long black hair who cried like infants and could lure or force others into the water. According to one tale, Pawapicts were the result of a wrestling match between a stout man named Pahahpooch and a wildcat, which led to Pahahpooch being transformed into a Water Baby after being thrown into a lake. These beings were feared for their ability to tempt or capture people, dragging them into the water where they would become Water Indians and take on the task of luring others to the same fate.
Stories also include personal encounters, such as those recounted by Ute elders, where Water Babies were seen drying their hair by the Provo River, their cries causing rivers to rise and frightening those who witnessed them.

Cultural significance
The legend of Water Babies reflects the broader Native American respect for natural forces, particularly the dual nature of water as both a life-giving and potentially destructive element. Water Babies serve as reminders of the power of nature and the necessity of maintaining harmony with it. Rituals, offerings, and respect are common themes across the tribes that share this belief, reflecting a deep-seated understanding of the spiritual significance of natural elements in Native American culture.

Etymology
The word appears in many Native American languages, and has many alternative translations. The source of the English word is the Ojibwe word wiindigoo. In the Cree language it is wīhtikow, also transliterated wetiko. Other transliterations include Wiindigoo, Weendigo, Windego, Wiindgoo, Windgo, Windago, Windiga, Wendego, Windagoo, Widjigo, Wiijigoo, Wijigo, Weejigo, Wìdjigò, Wintigo, Wentigo, Wehndigo, Wentiko, Windgoe, Wītikō, and Wintsigo.
A plural form windigoag is also spelled windegoag, wiindigooag, or windikouk.
The Proto-Algonquian term has been reconstructed as *wi·nteko·wa, which may have meant ""owl"".

Folklore
The wendigo is part of the traditional belief system of a number of Algonquin-speaking peoples, including the Ojibwe, the Saulteaux, the Cree, the Naskapi, and the Innu. Although descriptions can vary somewhat, common to all these cultures is the view that the wendigo is a malevolent, cannibalistic, supernatural being. They were strongly associated with the north, winter, cold, famine, and starvation.
Basil H. Johnston, an Ojibwe teacher and scholar from Ontario, describes a wendigo:

The Wendigo was gaunt to the point of emaciation, its desiccated skin pulled tightly over its bones. With its bones pushing out against its skin, its complexion the ash-gray of death, and its eyes pushed back deep into their sockets, the Wendigo looked like a gaunt skeleton recently disinterred from the grave. What lips it had were tattered and bloody ... Unclean and suffering from suppuration of the flesh, the Wendigo gave off a strange and eerie odor of decay and decomposition, of death and corruption.
In Ojibwe, Eastern Cree, Westmain Swampy Cree, Naskapi, and Innu lore, wendigos are often described as giants that are many times larger than human beings, a characteristic absent from myths in other Algonquian cultures. Whenever a wendigo ate another person, it would grow in proportion to the meal it had just eaten, so it could never be full. Therefore, wendigos are portrayed as simultaneously gluttonous and extremely thin due to starvation.
The wendigo is seen as the embodiment of gluttony, greed, and excess: never satisfied after killing and consuming one person, they are constantly searching for new victims.
A wendigo need not lose the human's powers of cognition or speech and in some depictions may clearly communicate with its prospective victims or even threaten or taunt them. A specimen of folk story collected in the early 20th century by Lottie Chicogquaw Marsden, an ethnographer of the Chippewas of Rama First Nation, in which a wendigo also exhibits tool use, an ability to survive partial dismemberment, and autocannibalism, reads:

One time long ago a big Windigo stole an Indian boy, but the boy was too thin, so the Windigo didn't eat him up right away, but he travelled with the Indian boy waiting for him till he'd get fat. The Windigo had a knife and he'd cut the boy on the hand to see if he was fat enough to eat, but the boy didn't get fat. They travelled too much. One day they came to an Indian village and the Windigo sent the boy to the Indian village to get some things for him to eat. He just gave the boy so much time to go there and back. The boy told the Indians that the Windigo was near them, and showed them his hand where the Windigo cut him to see if he was fat enough to eat. They heard the Windigo calling the boy. He said to the boy ""Hurry up. Don't tell lies to those Indians."" All of these Indians went to where the Windigo was and cut off his legs. They went back again to see if he was dead. He wasn't dead. He was eating the juice (marrow) from the inside of the bones of his legs that were cut off. The Indians asked the Windigo if there was any fat on them. He said, ""You bet there is, I have eaten lots of Indians, no wonder they are fat."" The Indians then killed him and cut him to pieces. This was the end of this Giant Windigo.

Human cannibalism
In some traditions, humans overpowered by greed could turn into wendigos; the myth thus served as a method of encouraging cooperation and moderation. Other sources say wendigos were created when a human resorted to cannibalism to survive. Humans could also turn into wendigos by being in contact with them for too long.

Taboo reinforcement ceremony
Among the Assiniboine, the Cree, and the Ojibwe, a satirical ceremonial dance is sometimes performed during times of famine to reinforce the seriousness of the wendigo taboo. The ceremony, known as wiindigookaanzhimowin, was performed during times of famine, and involved wearing masks and dancing backward around a drum. The last known wendigo ceremony conducted in the United States was at Lake Windigo of Star Island of Cass Lake, within the Leech Lake Indian Reservation in northern Minnesota.

Psychosis
In historical accounts of retroactively diagnosed wendigo psychosis, it has been reported that humans became possessed by the wendigo spirit, after being in a situation of needing food and having no other choice besides cannibalism. In 1661, The Jesuit Relations reported:

Although in many recorded cases of wendigo psychosis the individual has been killed to prevent cannibalism from resulting, some Cree folklore recommends treatment by ingestion of fatty animal meats or drinking animal grease; those treated may sometimes vomit ice as part of the curing process.
One of the more famous cases of wendigo psychosis reported involved a Plains Cree trapper from Alberta, named Swift Runner. During the winter of 1878, Swift Runner and his family were starving, and his eldest son died. Twenty-five miles away from emergency food supplies at a Hudson's Bay Company post, Swift Runner butchered and ate his wife and five remaining children. Given that he resorted to cannibalism so near to food supplies, and that he killed and consumed the remains of all those present, it was revealed that Swift Runner's was not a case of pure cannibalism as a last resort to avoid starvation, but rather of a man with wendigo psychosis. He eventually confessed and was executed by authorities at Fort Saskatchewan.
Another well-known case involving wendigo psychosis was that of Jack Fiddler, an Oji-Cree chief and medicine man known for his powers at defeating wendigos. In some cases, this entailed killing people with wendigo psychosis. As a result, in 1907, Fiddler and his brother Joseph were arrested by the Canadian authorities for homicide. Jack committed suicide, but Joseph was tried and sentenced to life in prison. He ultimately was granted a pardon but died three days later in jail before receiving the news of this pardon.
Fascination with wendigo psychosis among Western ethnographers, psychologists, and anthropologists led to a hotly debated controversy in the 1980s over the historicity of this phenomenon. Some researchers argued that, essentially, Wendigo psychosis was a fabrication, the result of naïve anthropologists taking stories related to them at face value without observation. Others have pointed to a number of credible eyewitness accounts, both by Algonquians and others, as evidence that wendigo psychosis was a factual historical phenomenon.
The frequency of wendigo psychosis cases decreased sharply in the 20th century as Boreal Algonquian people came into greater and greater contact with European ideologies and more sedentary, less rural, lifestyles.
In his 2004 treatise Revenge of the Windigo on disorders and treatments of the behavioral health industry in the United States and Canada that are peculiar to indigenous people, James B. Waldram wrote,

...no actual cases of windigo psychosis have ever been studied, and Lou Marano's scathing critique in 1985 should have killed off the cannibal monster within the psychiatric annals. The windigo, however, continues to seek revenge for this attempted scholarly execution by periodically duping unsuspecting passers-by, like psychiatrists, into believing that windigo psychosis not only exists but that a psychiatrist could conceivably encounter a patient suffering from this disorder in his or her practice today! Windigo psychosis may well be the most perfect example of the construction of an Aboriginal mental disorder by the scholarly professions, and its persistence dramatically underscores how constructions of the Aboriginal by these professions have, like Frankenstein's monster, taken on a life of their own.
The 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) classifies ""Windigo"" as a culture-specific disorder, describing it as ""Rare, historic accounts of cannibalistic obsession... Symptoms included depression, homicidal or suicidal thoughts, and a delusional, compulsive wish to eat human flesh... Some controversial new studies question the syndrome's legitimacy, claiming cases were actually a product of hostile accusations invented to justify the victim's ostracism or execution.""
Some metal, vitamin, and oligoelements deficiencies are linked to psychosis-like conditions, Wendigo could be a folk elaboration of some near-starvation mental disorders.

As a concept or metaphor
In addition to denoting a cannibalistic monster from certain traditional folklore, some Native Americans also understand the wendigo conceptually. As a concept, the wendigo can apply to any person, idea, or movement infected by a corrosive drive toward self-aggrandizing greed and excessive consumption, traits that sow disharmony and destruction if left unchecked. Ojibwe scholar Brady DeSanti asserts that the wendigo ""can be understood as a marker indicating... a person... imbalanced both internally and toward the larger community of human and spiritual beings around them."" Out of equilibrium and estranged by their communities, individuals thought to be afflicted by the wendigo spirit unravel and destroy the ecological balance around them. Chippewa author Louise Erdrich's novel The Round House, winner of the National Book Award, depicts a situation where an individual person becomes a wendigo. The novel describes its primary antagonist, a rapist whose violent crimes desecrate a sacred site, as a wendigo who must be killed because he threatens the reservation's safety.
In addition to characterizing individual people who exhibit destructive tendencies, the wendigo can also describe movements and events with similarly negative effects. According to Professor Chris Schedler, the figure of the wendigo represents ""consuming forms of exclusion and assimilation"" through which groups dominate other groups."" This application allows Native Americans to describe colonialism and its agents as wendigos since the process of colonialism ejected natives from their land and threw the natural world out of balance. DeSanti points to the 1999 horror film Ravenous as an illustration of this argument equating ""the cannibal monster"" to ""American colonialism and manifest destiny"". This movie features a character who articulates that expansion brings displacement and destruction as side effects, explaining that ""manifest destiny"" and ""western expansion"" will bring ""thousands of gold-hungry Americans... over the mountains in search of new lives... This country is seeking to be whole... Stretching out its arms... and consuming all it can. And we merely follow"".
As a concept, wendigo can apply to situations other than some Native American-European relations. It can serve as a metaphor explaining any pattern of domination by which groups subjugate and dominate or violently destroy and displace. Joe Lockhard, English professor at Arizona State University, argues that wendigos are agents of ""social cannibalism"" who know ""no provincial or national borders; all human cultures have been visited by shape-shifting wendigos. Their visitations speak to the inseparability of human experience... National identity is irrelevant to this borderless horror."" Lockhard's ideas explain that wendigos are an expression of a dark aspect of human nature: the drive toward greed, consumption, and disregard for other life in the pursuit of self-aggrandizement.
Romantic scholar and documentarian Emily Zarka, also a professor at Arizona State University, observes that two commonalities among the indigenous cultures of Algonquian language family speakers are that they are situated in climes where harsh winters are frequent and may be accompanied by starvation. She states that the wendigo symbolically represents three major concepts: it is the incarnation of winter, the embodiment of hunger, and the personification of selfishness.

In popular culture
Although distinct from how it appears in the traditional lore, one of the first appearances of a character inspired by, or named after, a wendigo in non-Indigenous literature is Algernon Blackwood's 1910 novella The Wendigo. Joe Nazare wrote that Blackwood's ""subtly-demonizing rhetoric transforms the Wendigo from a native myth into a descriptive template for the Indian savage.""
Blackwood's work has influenced many of the subsequent portrayals in mainstream horror fiction, such as August Derleth's ""The Thing that Walked on the Wind"" and ""Ithaqua"" (1933 and 1941), which in turn inspired the character in Stephen King's novel Pet Sematary, where it is a personification of evil, an ugly grinning creature with yellow-grey eyes, ears replaced by ram's horns, white vapor coming from its nostrils, and a pointed, decaying yellow tongue. These works set the template for later portrayals in popular culture, at times even replacing the Native American lore. In an early short story by Thomas Pynchon, ""Mortality and Mercy in Vienna"" (first published in 1959), the plot centers around a character developing Wendigo syndrome and going on a killing spree.
In 1973 a character inspired by the wendigo appeared in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by the writer Steve Englehart and artist Herb Trimpe, the monster is the result of a curse that afflicts those who commit acts of cannibalism. The Marvel Comics version does not resemble a traditional wendigo as portrayed by popular culture, but rather a silver-haired Bigfoot-like being. It first appeared in The Incredible Hulk #162 (April 1973), and again in the October 1974 issue.
Contemporary Indigenous works that explore the legend include the 1995 novel Solar Storms, by author and poet Linda K. Hogan (Chickasaw), which explores the stories of the wendigo and incorporates the creatures as a device to interrogate issues of independence, spirituality, politics, an individual's relationship to the family, and as a metaphor for corporate voracity, exploitation, and power - all viewed as a form of cannibalism. Wrist, the 2016 debut novel by First Nations horror fiction writer Nathan Niigan Noodin Adler (Lac Des Milles Lacs Anishinaabe), combines the traditional Ojibwe legend with the author's ideas inspired by non-Indigenous writers like Anne Rice and Tim Powers.
Other creatures based on the legend, or named for it, appear in various films and television shows, including Dark Was the Night, Ravenous (1999), The Lone Ranger (2013), and the 2021 film Antlers by Scott Cooper, where the wendigo is portrayed as a deer-like creature with a glowing heart that moves from person to person with a never ending hunger. Guillermo del Toro, producer of the film, developed the wendigo on the basis that the more the creature eats, the more it gets hungry and the more it gets hungry, the weaker it becomes. In the 2021 film The Inhuman (L'Inhumain) the arrival of a wendigo symbolizes inner turmoil after a character turns his back on his Indigenous heritage in the pursuit of material success.
Various characters inspired by the legend, or named for it, appear in role-playing video games. The interactive horror video game Until Dawn (2015) features a Wendigo as a central antagonist, as the game is set primarily in a former Native American territory. In 2018's Fallout 76 by Bethesda Game Studios, wendigos are featured as one of the cryptid enemies found in the area of Appalachia, mutated from people who consumed human flesh in isolation. In the 2018 first-person shooter video game Dusk, wendigos are enemies that remain invisible until they receive damage. Several of these creatures also appear in the game's cover art.

Criticism
Scholar Francesca Amee Johnson criticized the use of the Wendigo as an antagonist horror character in popular culture in Reinvention: an International Journal of Undergraduate Research. She noted that many popular depictions, like Until Dawn (2015), The Retreat (2020), and Supernatural (2005–2020) are created by mostly non-native writers. The use of the Wendigo as an antagonist has become a common trope, ""as it easily creates a villain for white protagonists to defeat repeatedly."" Johnson writes, This construction is problematic in the horror genre as it presents an Indigenous antagonist that poses a threat to white culture for its otherness and indigeneity – while at the same time, misappropriating, discarding and demonising the Indigenous culture the myth comes from, at whim.

History
Some believe the White River Monster may have affected the Civil War. The river was used for transportation, and the monster was supposedly responsible for overturning a boat. Sightings of the monster began in 1915.  On July 1 of that year, an owner of a plantation near the river saw the monster. He reported it having gray skin and ""as wide as a car and three cars long."" As the news spread construction of a rope net began, but ended due to lack of money and materials.
In the first week of 1937, recreational fishermen noticed that they were finding it hard to land many fish, and the creature was spotted again, and reported to Bramlett Bateman, a nearby plantation owner, who later confirmed the sighting, describing it as having ""the skin of an elephant, four or five feet wide by twelve feet long, with the face of a catfish, . . .  lolling on the surface of the water.""  Feeling the creature was a threat to his crops, he intended to blow up the eddy where the creature was spotted with TNT, but area authorities denied necessary permission.  A minor media sensation resulted in visitors from across the nation, some bringing cameras, explosives, and a machine gun, and when no more sightings were made, when a plan to capture it with a giant net failed, and when a deep sea diver failed to find the creature, Bateman was thought to have created a hoax, despite over 100 confirmed sightings recorded during the short period of excitement.
The White River Monster was sighted again in the summer of 1971. That year, eyewitnesses who encountered the creature described it as ""the size of a boxcar"" with a bone protruding from its forehead. ""It looked as if the thing was peeling all over, but it was a smooth type of skin or flesh,"" said one, and it made strange noises that sounded like a combination of a ""cow's moo and a horse's neigh."" Other accounts of the White River Monster described three-toed tracks, 14 inches (360 mm) in length, on Towhead Island leading down to the river through a path of bent trees and crushed bushes.
In 1973, the Arkansas State Legislature signed into law a bill by state Senator Robert Harvey, creating the White River Monster Refuge along the White River. The area is located between ""the southern point on the river known as Old Grand Glaize and a northern point on White River known as Rosie."" It is illegal to harm the monster inside the refuge.

Identification
While the existence of the creature is not controversial, the question has arisen as to identifying it with a known species. Biologist Roy Mackal was persuaded that the monster was an elephant seal. Joe Nickell has criticized this conclusion due to the White River being well out of the range of elephant seals. His conclusion is that the monster(s) were Florida manatees, also known as ""sea cows"".

전설에 의하면 그는 귀가 컸다 하며, '임금님 귀는 당나귀 귀' 설화의 주인공이기도 하다.

생애
즉위 초반
865년 4월에는 당나라 황제인 의종으로부터＜개부의동삼사·검교태위·시절대도독·계림주제군사·상주국·신라왕(開府儀同三司・検校太尉・侍節大都督・雞林州諸軍事・上柱国・新羅王)＞으로 책봉되었다. 또, 이때에는 왕뿐만이 아니라 왕비·왕태자·대재상·소재상에게도 하사품이 있었다.
867년 5월에는 왕도 금성에서 역병이 유행했고, 동년 8월에는 홍수가 일어났다. 지방 각지에서도 곡물이 여물지 않고, 왕은 각지에 안무의 사자를 파견하고 위문에 노력했다. 869년 7월에는 왕자 김윤(金胤)을 당에 파견해, 말 2마리·사금 100 냥·은 2백 냥 외 , 다양한 물품을 전해졌다. 이때는 이동(李同)을 김윤에 따르게 하고, 당나라에서 학업을 거두게 하는 것과 동시에 서적을 구입하기 위한 비용으로 해서 은 3백 냥을 이동에게 하사하였다.

호족의 반란과 진압
즉위 중반부터 호족의 반란과 왜구의 침입에 시달렸다. 866년 10월에는 이찬 윤흥(允興)이 그 남동생 숙흥(叔興), 계흥(季興)과 함께 반역을 꾀했다. 사전에 발각되어 윤흥 일당은 대산군(岱山郡, 경상북도 성주군)으로 도주했지만, 포박되어 참형당하고 그 일족은 몰살되었다. 한편 수시로 각 주현에 병력을 보내고 지방관을 파견하여 호족들을 감시하는 한편 왜구를 토벌하였다.
868년 1월에는 이찬 김예(金鋭), 김현(金鉉)등이 반란을 일으켜 죽였다. 게다가 874년 5월에도 이찬 근종(近宗)이 반란을 일으키고 궁궐까지 쳐들어왔으나 경문왕은 근위병을 파견해 반란군을 격파하고 근종을 잡아 거열형으로 처벌했다. 반란군을 일망타진할 만한 통제력이 없던 선왕 문성왕의 무렵과 비교하면, 경문왕 때에는 통제력을 조금 회복하기 시작하였다.

치세 후반
870년에는 왕도가 지진·홍수에 휩쓸려 그 겨울에는 다시 역병이 유행하게 되었다. 873년에도 기아와 역병이 일어나, 왕은 백성에게 곡물을 주어 구제했지만, 정황은 안정되지 않았다. 역병 등의 액재와 호응 하는 것도 아니게 왕도로의 귀족층의 반란이 잇따른 것은, 그 현상이라고 보인다.
870년 2월에는 사찬 김인(金因)을 당에 숙위 시켰다. 874년에는 희종으로부터의 선유사를 받고 있어 당과의 교류는 지난날의 번성함을 회복했다. 이전, 864년 4월에 일본으로부터도 국사를 맞이했던 것이 기록되고 있다.
재위 15년째인 875년 8월 16일(음력 7월 8일)에 사망했고, 경문왕이 시호이다.

설화
경문왕은 '임금님 귀는 당나귀 귀' 설화의 등장인물이기도 하며 산 뱀을 가슴에 덮고 잠을 자는 습관이 있었다고 삼국유사에 전한다. 그의 귀는 당나귀처럼 귀가 길고 컸는데, 이를 숨기기 위해서 일부러 이발하지 않았다.
그러나 그의 머리를 깎으며 왕의 귀가 길고 크게 된 것을 알게된 이발사가 이를 함구한 나머지 너무 답답해하다가 죽음에 이르러 경주 남쪽의 대나무밭에 가서 '임금님 귀는 당나귀 귀'라고 외쳤다. 이후 그 대나무밭에서 바람이 불 때마다 그 외치는 소리가 울려 퍼졌고 이에 화가 난 경문왕은 그 대나무밭의 대나무를 모조리 베게 했다. 그 뒤로는 임금님 귀는 당나귀 귀 대신 우리 임금님 귀는 길다 하는 소리가 들려왔다고 한다. 왕은 귀가 긴 것에 신경을 쓰게 된 나머지 근심하다가 결국 몸져눕게 되어 죽음에 이르게 됐다고 한다.

생애
65년 탈해 이사금이 밤에 금성(金城) 서쪽 시림(始林)의 수풀 속에서 닭 울음 소리를 듣고서 신하 호공(瓠公)을 시켜 가보게 하였다. 금빛의 작은 함이 나뭇가지에 걸려 있고 흰 닭이 그 밑에서 울고 있다고 재상 호공이 보고하자, 왕이 직접 가서 함을 열어보니 용모가 아름다운 사내아이가 나왔다. 이때부터 시림을 계림(鷄林)이라 하고, 아이는 금함에서 나왔으므로 성을 김씨라 하였다.
《삼국사기》 〈미추왕조〉에는 알지가 세한(勢漢)을 낳고 세한이 아도(阿道), 아도가 수류(首留), 수류가 욱보(郁甫), 욱보가 구도(仇道)를 낳고, 구도는 미추를 낳았다고 함으로써, 알지를 시조로 하는 경주 김씨의 세보(世譜)를 소개하고 있다. 알지의 의미에 대해서는 여러 설이 분분하다. 《삼국유사》에 따르면, 알지라는 말은 어린아이, 즉 아기를 부를 때 쓰는 말이라고 하였으나 이는 후대에 붙인 기록이므로 당대에도 그렇게 쓰였는지는 알 수는 없다.알지는 고대에 성모(聖母)를 뜻하는 말이었다는 설이 있다.
또한 신라의 시조왕인 박혁거세 설화에서 혁거세거서간(居西干)이 알에서 나와 처음 입을 열 적에 스스로 알지거서간이라 했다는 기록도 있는데, 이로써 알지는 곡물 또는 곡물에 들어있는 신령(神靈)을 나타내는 말이고 특정의 인명이 아닌 농업의 신 또는 그 대리자로서의 기능을 가지는 신라 초기 왕을 표현하는 것으로 보기도 하고 알지의 알은 금(金)을 나타내는 말이고 지는 존장자(尊長者)에 붙이는 존칭어이므로 알지는 김씨 부족의 족장을 뜻한다고 알려져 있다.
이 기록은 김씨 부족의 시조 출현을 나타내주는 것으로, 그가 석씨 시조인 탈해왕에 의해 발견되어 양육되었다는 것은 신라 왕위계승에서 김씨의 등장과 독점이 가장 늦었음을 보여주는 것이라고 해석하고 있다. 《삼국유사》에도 거의 같은 전설이 기록되어 있으며, 탈해왕이 김알지를 태자로 책봉하였으나 후에 파사 이사금에게 양보했다고 한다.
이후의 생애는 알려져 있지 않으며, 그의 7대손 미추 이사금이 김씨 최초로 왕에 즉위하였다. 알지에서 미추까지의 세보는 《삼국사기》와 《삼국유사》에 약간의 차이가 있으나 세대수는 같다.
한편 《조선왕조실록》에는 그가 세조(世祖)로 추존되었다고 기록되어 있다. 신라의 추존왕으로 추정되는 태조 성한왕이 그와 동일인물이라는 설이 있다.

관련 성씨
본관 경주 김씨로부터 분파 된 강릉 김씨, 연안 김씨와 김씨에서 권씨로 환성한 안동 권씨 또한 김알지의 후예이다.
김씨 분관록, 증보문헌비고 등의 문헌(文獻)에 의하면 신라 때 왕족의 두 형제가 왕에게 직간(直諫)하다가 오히려 미움을 받아 먼 곳으로 유배되어 형은 북빈경(北濱京. 지금의 강릉)에 살게 되었고, 동생은 동음홀(冬音忽)• 시염성(鼓鹽城. 지금의 연안군)에 살게 되었다고 한다.

탄생 신화
《삼국사기(三國史記)》와 《삼국유사(三國遺事)》에 실려 있다. 65년(탈해왕 9) 8월 4일 호공(瓠公)이 시림(始林) 속에서 큰 광명이 비치는 것을 보았다. 자색 구름이 하늘에서 땅으로 뻗쳤는데, 구름 가운데 황금궤가 나무 끝에 걸려 있고 그 빛이 궤에서 나오며, 흰 닭이 나무 밑에서 울어 왕께 아뢰었다. 왕이 숲에 가서 궤를 열어보니 사내아이가 누워 있다가 일어났다. 이는 박혁거세의 출생과 같으므로, 박혁거세를 알지라 한 선례에 따라 이름지었다. 아기를 안고 대궐로 돌아오니 새와 짐승들이 서로 따르며 기뻐하였다. 왕이 좋은 날을 받아 태자로 책봉하니 그가 곧 김알지이다.

가계
부인 : 마정부인(摩貞夫人), 석강조(昔康造)의 딸
아들 : 김세한(金勢漢)
손자 : 김아도(金阿道)
처조부 : 탈해 이사금(脫解尼師今)

성한과 동일인 설
경주 김씨의 족보에는 그의 아들을 세한, 열한, 성한 등의 다양한 이름으로 불리는 인물로 기록하고 있으나, 성한 (신라)과 그를 동일 인물로 보는 시각도 있다. 조선 후기의 김정희는 경주 김씨의 족보상 그의 아들로 등재된 성한왕과 그를 동일 인물로 추정했다.

김알지 초기 세보
《삼국사기》 : 알지 → 세한(勢漢) → 아도(阿道) → 수류(首留) → 욱보(郁甫) → 구도(仇道) → 미추
《삼국유사》 : 알지 → 열한(熱漢) → 아도(阿都) → 수류(首留) → 욱부(郁部) → 구도(俱道 또는 仇刀) → 미추

이 피리를 불면, 적병이 물러가고 병이 쾌유되며, 가뭄에는 비가 오고 장마는 개었으며, 바람이 잦아들고 물결이 평온해졌기에 이를 '온갖 파도를 잠재우는 피리'라는 뜻의 '만파식적'(萬波息笛)으로 부르고 국보로 삼았다고 한다.

개요
《삼국유사》에는 신라 신문왕(神文王)이 이 피리를 얻게 된 것은 바다의 용이 된 문무왕과 천신(天神)이 된 김유신이 합심하여 보내 준 것이라 하며, 이를 얻게 된 경위에 대해서 다음과 같이 전하고 있다.

신문왕 2년 임오(682년) 5월 초하루에 파진찬(波珍湌) 박숙청(朴夙淸)이 ""동해 앞바다에 작은 산 하나가 물에 떠서 감은사(感恩寺)를 향해 오는데, 물결을 따라서 왔다 갔다 한다""고 보고하였다. 신문왕이 이를 일관(日官) 김춘질(金春質, 춘일春日이라고도)에게 점을 쳐 보게 하였고, 김춘질은 신문왕의 부왕(문무왕)께서 이제 바다의 용이 되어 삼한(三韓)을 수호하고 또 김유신(金庾信)도 33천의 한 사람으로 인간 세상에 내려와 대신이 되었는데, 두 성인(聖人)이 덕을 같이 하여 나라를 지킬 보배를 내어 주려 하는 것이며, 왕이 바다로 가면 값을 매길 수 없는 어마어마한 보물을 얻게 될 것이라고 아뢰었다.
신문왕은 그 말대로 5월 7일에 이견대로 행차하여 바다 위에 떠다니고 있다는 그 산을 바라 보면서 사자를 보내 살펴 보도록 하였는데, 산의 형세는 거북이의 머리 같고, 그 위에 한 줄기 대나무가 있는데, 낮에는 둘로 쪼개졌다가 밤에는 하나로 합쳐졌다(일설에는 산도 대나무를 따라 밤낮으로 합치고 갈라지고를 반복하였다고 한다). 사자의 보고를 들은 왕은 그날 감은사에서 유숙하였는데, 이튿날 오시(午時)에 대나무가 하나로 합쳐지더니 천지가 진동하며 비바람이 몰아쳐서 이레 동안이나 온통 어둡다가 16일이 되어서야 바람이 잦아들고 물결도 평온해졌다.
신문왕이 배를 타고 그 대나무가 있는 산으로 들어가자, 용이 나타나 검은 옥대(玉帶)를 바쳤다. 신문왕이 용에게 산과 대나무가 갈라지기도 하고 합해지기도 하는 이유를 묻자 용은 손뼉을 한 손으로 치면 소리가 나지 않고, 두 손으로 쳐야 소리가 나는 것처럼 이 대나무도 하나로 합쳐진 뒤에야 소리가 나는데, 성왕(聖王)께서 '소리'로써 천하를 다스릴 좋은 징조라고 일러 주며 이 대나무를 가지고 피리를 만들어 불면 천하가 화평할 것이라고 알려 주었다. 그 섬과 대나무는 바다의 용이 된 문무왕과 천신이 된 김유신이 함께 보내 온 것이었다.
신문왕은 오색 비단과 금과 옥을 용에게 주고, 사자를 시켜 대나무를 베어서 바다에서 나왔다. 그러자 산과 용은 갑자기 사라져 보이지 않았다. 왕은 그날 감은사에서 묵고 다음날 17일에 기림사(祗林寺) 서쪽 냇가를 거쳐 서라벌로 돌아온 뒤, 대나무로 피리를 만들어 월성(月城)의 천존고(天尊庫)에 간직하고 국보로 삼았다.
《삼국사기》 악지에는 고기(古記) 인용으로 ""신문왕 때에 동해(東海) 가운데에 홀연히 작은 산이 나타났는데, 모습이 거북이 머리와 같았다. 그 위에 한 그루의 대나무가 있어서 낮에는 갈라져 둘이 되었다가 밤에는 합해져 하나가 되었다. 왕이 사람을 시켜 베어다가 적(笛)을 만들고 이름하여 만파식(萬波息)이라 하였다.”라고만 언급되어 있고 《삼국유사》와 같은 장황한 이야기는 싣지 않았으며, 유교적인 관점에서 '괴이하여 믿을 수 없다'고 평하였다.
《삼국유사》에는 또 원성왕(元聖王)의 아버지인 대각간(大角干) 김효양(金孝讓)이 만파식적을 아들에게 전했다고 한다.

만파식적 이야기의 배경 시점에 대한 논의
《삼국유사》에는 신문왕이 만파식적을 만들게 될 대나무를 얻어 돌아오다 기림사 서쪽 냇가에서 잠시 어가를 멈추고 점심을 먹을 때 태자 이공(理恭)이 대궐을 지키고 있다가 말을 달려와서 하례하고 부왕을 뵙고는 왕이 용으로부터 받은 옥대는 그 쪽들이 모두 진짜 용으로 이루어져 있다며 쪽 하나를 떼어서 물에 넣어 볼 것을 권했는데, 이에 신문왕이 옥대 왼편 두 번째 쪽을 떼어 시냇물에 넣었더니 그 쪽은 곧 용이 되어 하늘로 올라갔고, 쪽을 넣었던 그 자리는 연못으로 변했으므로 그 연못을 용연(龍淵)이라고 불렀다고 한다.
여기서 태자 이공이 등장하는 것에 대해 시대적으로 맞지 않는다는 지적이 있어 왔는데, 1990년에 두창구(杜鋹球)는 ｢만파식적고｣(萬波息笛考)에서 《삼국사기》에 따르면 태자 이공 즉 효소왕이 태어난 것은 신문왕 7년(687) 봄 2월의 일이고, 신문왕 11년(691) 봄 3월 1일에야 왕자 이홍(理洪)이 태자로 봉해졌으므로 《삼국유사》에서 신문왕 2년(682년)이라고 한 것과는 서로 연대가 맞지 않는다고 지적하였다. 두창구는 《삼국유사》 주기(注記)에서 ""일본(一本)에는 천수(天授) 원년(690년, 신문왕 10년)이라 했다""라고 한, 정작 일연은 잘못된 기록이라고 부기했던 시점이 오히려 실제 만파식적 이야기의 배경 시점으로 보아야 한다고 하였다. 아울러 삼국사기 신문왕 9년(689년)에 월성군(月城郡)에 행행하였다는 것이나 이 해에 달구벌(達句伐)로 도읍을 옮기려 한 것이 이보다 2년 전인 동왕 7년(687년) 오묘(五廟)에 치제(致祭)한 사연과 연관되어 있다고 볼 때 이것이 만파식적의 성립 배경의 단서가 될 수 있을 것이라고 하였다.
하지만 두창구의 설을 따라 만파식적 이야기의 배경이 690년이라고 한다 해도 690년 당시에는 이공의 나이가 네 살이었으므로 네 살에 불과한 아이가 삼국유사에 언급된 것처럼 행동했다는 것이나 날짜를 '임오 5월 초하루'라고 명시된 것을 어떻게 부정할 것이냐 하는 문제를 안고 있다.

만파식적 전설
《삼국유사》에는 만파식적을 얻은 이후 있었던 이야기가 전해지고 있다.

국선을 되찾아온 이야기
신문왕의 뒤를 이어 즉위한 효소왕 대인 천수(天授) 4년 즉 장수(長壽) 2년 계사(693년) 3월 11일에 당시의 국선(國仙) 부례랑(夫禮郞)이 낭도들을 거느리고 금란(金蘭) 땅으로 출유했다가 북명(北溟)에서 적적(狄賊)들에게 납치당했다. 문객들은 모두 어찌할 줄을 모르고 돌아왔으나 부례랑의 낭도였던 안상(安常) 한 사람이 이를 뒤쫓아 국경을 넘어갔다.
부례랑이 납치되었다는 소식이 전해졌을 때, 상서로운 구름이 천존고(天尊庫)를 덮는 일이 벌어졌는데, 효소왕이 사람을 시켜 조사해 보니 천존고에 보관되어 있던 만파식적과 현금(玄琴)이 모두 사라지고 없었다. 효소왕은 거듭되는 사태에 한탄하면서 창고지기 김정고(金貞高) 등 다섯 명을 하옥하였다. 4월에는 온 나라에 현상금을 걸고 거문고와 피리를 찾는 자는 1년치 조세를 상금으로 주겠다고 하였다.
두 달 뒤인 5월 15일, 앞서 부례랑의 부모인 살찬(사찬) 대현(大玄)과 용보 부인(龍寶夫人) 부부가 백률사(栢栗寺)의 대비상 앞에 나아가서 며칠에 걸쳐 천제(天帝)에게 기도하고 있었는데, 문득 백률사의 향탁(香卓) 위에 현금과 만파식적이 모두 놓여 있고, 부례랑과 안상 두 사람도 모두 불상 뒤에 있었다. 대현 부부는 기뻐하고 또 놀라면서 어떻게 된 것인지 물었는데, 부례랑이 말해 준 이야기는 다음과 같았다.
부례랑은 적적에게 붙잡혀 간 뒤 그 나라의 대도구라(大都仇羅)라는 집의 목동이 되어 대오라니(大烏羅尼) 들판에서 방목을 하고 있었는데, 어느 날 위의가 단정한 한 승려가 거문고와 피리를 들고 부례랑 앞에 나타나서 고향 생각을 하고 있느냐고 물었고, 부례랑이 임금과 부모님을 그리워하고 있음을 털어 놓자 승려는 자신을 따라오라고 하고는 부례랑을 바닷가로 데리고 갔는데, 바닷가에서 안상과 만나게 되었다. 승려는 들고 있던 피리를 둘로 쪼개어 부례랑과 안상이 각자 한쪽씩 나눠 타게 하고 자신은 거문고를 타고 바다 위에 떠서, 잠깐 사이에 백률사에 도착해 있었다는 것이다.
이를 들은 효소왕은 크게 놀라며 사람을 보내어 부례랑을 대궐로 맞아들이고 현금과 만파식적도 대궐 안으로 옮기게 하였다. 또한 부례랑과 안상이 돌아올 수 있었던 것이 백률사 대비상의 영험이라 하여 백률사에도 많은 시주를 거행하고, 백률사의 주지를 봉성사로 옮기도록 하였다. 온 나라에 크게 사면하였으며 관인들에게는 관작 3급을 올려 주고 백성들에게도 3년치 조세를 면제해 주었다. 부례랑과 그 아버지 대현은 각각 대각간(大角干)과 태대각간(太大角干)이 되었고, 어머니 용보부인은 사량부(沙梁部) 경정궁주(鏡井宮主)가 되었으며 안상은 대통(大統)이 되었다. 또한 앞서 천존고의 창고지기로 감옥에 갇혔던 이들도 모두 풀려나고 관작이 각기 5급씩 올랐다.
그런데 6월 12일과 17일에 혜성(彗星)이 동쪽과 서쪽에 각각 나타나자 이를 일관을 시켜 점쳐 보게 하였더니 현금과 만파식적의 영험에 대해서 관작을 봉하지 않아서라는 괘가 나왔고, 이에 효소왕이 만파식적을 만만파파식(萬萬波波息)이라고 부르게 하자 혜성이 이내 물러갔다고 한다.

일본의 사신이 만파식적을 청한 이야기
원성왕이 만파식적을 전해 받고 왕으로 즉위한 뒤인 당 정원(貞元) 2년 병인(786년) 10월 11일에 일본왕 문경(文慶)이 군사를 일으켜 신라를 치려 했으나 신라에 만파식적이 있다는 말을 듣고 군사를 돌렸으며, 대신 금 50냥을 사신에게 주어 신라로 보내 만파식적을 청했다. 원성왕은 상대(上代)의 진평왕(眞平王) 때에 그런 것이 있었다고는 들었지만 지금은 어디 있는지 모른다고 대답하고 사신을 돌려 보냈다. 이듬해(787년) 7월 7일에도 일본에서 다시 사신이 와서 만파식적을 요청하면서 금 1천 냥을 바치고, 그 신물(神物)을 보기만 하고 다시 돌려보내겠다고 했지만 원성왕은 지난번과 같은 대답으로 이를 사양하며 돌려 보내고, 대신 은 3천 냥을 사신에게 주었다. 일본의 사신은 한 달 뒤인 8월에 돌아갔고, 원성왕은 만파식적을 내황전(內黃殿)에 보관하게 하였다.
《삼국유사》에는 '일본 왕 문경'에 대해서 《일본제기》(日本帝紀)라는 문헌을 인용하여 일본의 제55대 문덕(文德, 재위 850 ~ 858)을 가리키는 듯하다고 하였는데, 이 문덕(몬토쿠 천황)의 태자라는 설도 있다는 주기를 붙였다.
한편 일본의 《문덕천황실록》에는 몬토쿠 천황 재위기에 신라에 사신을 보냈었다는 언급을 찾아볼 수 없다. 다만 12세기에 성립된 일본의 설화집 《곤자쿠 이야기집》(今昔物語集) 권14 '조복법(調伏法)의 영험력(靈驗力)에 의해 도시히토(利仁) 장군이 죽은 이야기'라고 해서, 몬토쿠 천황 때에 진주후쇼군(鎮守府将軍) 후지와라노 도시히토(藤原利仁, 생몰년 미상)라는 인물이 신라 정토(征討)를 명받았다는 이야기가 실려 있다. 신라측은 일본이 신라를 정벌하려 한다는 이야기를 사전에 알고 당(唐)의 법전(法全)이라는 아사리(阿闍利)를 불러 들여 조복(調伏) 기도를 올리게 하였는데, 마침 당에 유학하여 법전 아사리로부터 사사하고 있던 일본의 승려 엔친(円珍)도 이 조복기도에 가담하였다. 조복기도 이레째, 진군하던 도중에 병으로 야마자키에 머무르고 있던 후지와라노 도시히토는 별안간 자리에서 벌떡 일어나 허공을 향해 마구 칼을 휘두르다가 쓰러져 사망하였다고 한다.
《다몬슈》(打聞集)나 《고지단》(古事談)에도 《곤자쿠 이야기집》과 같은 계통의 설화가 기재되어 있으며, '신라 정토' 설화가 성립되었을 인세이 시기에는 영웅적 무인으로서의 후지와라노 도시히토의 원형이 만들어져 있었다. 후지와라노 도시히토의 신라 정토 설화는 《오토기조시》에서의 '도시히토 장군의 당토(唐土) 정토 이야기'의 골격이 되었다. 다만 후지와라노 도시히토는 몬토쿠 천황 때의 인물이 아니었고, 그가 맡은 진주후쇼군이라는 직책도 일본 동북쪽 미치노쿠 방면의 방비가 주요 임무였기에, 후지와라노 도시히토에 대한 확실한 기록이 일찍 사라져 버리면서 만들어진 이야기로 여겨지고 있다. 《고지단》에서는 비슷한 이야기를 재수록하면서 우다 천황(宇多天皇) 때의 일이라고 하였다.

신라옥적
신라의 수도였던 경주에는 신라옥적(新羅玉笛)이라 불리는, 옥으로 제작된 피리가 경주의 객사인 동경관(東京館)에 보관되고 있었다. 조선 시대에는 이 신라옥적을 만파식적과 동일시하여 보관하였다.
이 피리는 또한 조령(문경새재)을 넘어가면 소리가 나지 않았다고 전한다. 이 전설은 조선 후기에까지 언급될 정도로 널리 알려져 있었다. 신라가 멸망한 뒤에 경주를 떠나 서울로 옮겨지게 되었으나 피리는 소리가 나지 않았고, 신라 경내로 들어오자 다시 소리가 났다. 이러한 일이 반복되자 이를 가져오지 말고 경주에 그대로 보관하게 하였고, 이후 조선 시대까지 경주의 객사에서 보관하게 되었다는 것이다.
조선 시대에도 경주의 신라옥적에 대해서는 널리 알려져 있어서, 성현이 신라옥적에 대한 시를 남기기도 했고 연산군이 이 옥적을 서울로 가지고 오게 해서 내고에 간수하게 하였다는 기록이 실록에 전하고 있다.
신라옥적은 임진왜란 때에 동경관이 소실되었을 때 행방불명되었고, 광해군 때 경주부윤이 옛 모습을 상고해 새로 만들게 하였다. 조선 숙종 16년(1690년), 동경관에서 일하던 향리 김승학(金承學)이 폭우로 무너진 동경관의 담장을 보수하다가 전란 중에 누군가가 감추었던 것으로 보이는 문제의 옛 옥피리를 찾아냈다고 한다. 김승학은 피리를 집으로 가져가 죽을 때까지 보관했지만 그가 숙종 33년(1707년) 사망한 뒤에 관아에 그 사실이 알려졌고, 관아에서는 이 피리를 진품 신라옥적으로 간주하여 압수해 다시 동경관에 보관하였다.
《동경잡기》에는 옥피리가 불에 타고 부서져 10여 조각이 났고, 김승학이 이를 사사로이 숨겨 두고 있다가 그만 가운데를 부러뜨렸는데, 경주부윤 이인징이 부러지고 갈라진 부분을 밀랍으로 붙이고 은으로 도장을 했고, 세 마디에 구멍은 아홉 개였다고 적고 있다.
1909년 4월 일본의 부통감 소네 아라스케 일행이 경북 경주군(현 경주시)를 현장 시찰한다는 명목으로 옛 경주 관아를 사흘에 걸쳐 수색했고, 누군가가 관기(官妓)를 관리하던 건물의 땔감 창고에 숨겨 두었던 신라옥적을 찾아내 이를 이듬해 경성으로 반출했다. 이후 신라옥적은 이왕가박물관에서 보관하게 되었다.
1921년 9월 경주 노서리 언덕에서 공사 도중 우연히 신라 왕릉인 금관총(金冠塚)이 발견되었을 때에도 조선총독부는 출토 유물들을 경성으로 옮기려 했지만 이를 반대하는 주민 여론에 밀려 포기했다. 당시 경주 유지로 있던 조선인과 일본인 19명이 1921년 10월 15일 총독부에 청원서를 제출하여 금관총 출토품과 더불어 신라옥적을 경주로 되돌려 놓을 것을 요구했다.

예전에 신라 국보의 전설이 전해진 옥적 기타를 당시 위정자가 다른 곳으로 옮긴 것은 우리의 특별한 원한이 되어 왔는데 이번에 또 우리가 발견한 소중한 유물이 이관된다는 이야기를 들어 감분(感憤)을 가라앉힐 수 없습니다.

이 청원서에는 당시 경주고적보존회의 중심 인물이자 총독부박물관 경주분관장을 지내는 등 총독부와 연줄이 있었던 모로가 히데오(諸鹿央雄)도 참여했는데, 그는 지역 유지로서 자신의 명성을 드높이기 위해 경주 주민들의 요청을 받아들였다. 1923년 금관총 출토 유물과 신라옥적이 경주로 돌아와 1924년에 경주박물관에 보관될 수 있었다. 신라옥적이 반출된지 14년 만이었다.
이후 관람객에게는 오랫동안 비공개였다가 2011년 특별전시회에서 만파식적이라는 이름으로 임시로 진열됐고, 특별전이 끝난 뒤 다시 수장고에 들어갔다.
조선 후기의 실학자 정약용은 이러한 설에 대해서 신라옥적은 굵기가 통통하고 손가락 대는 부분 구멍이 좁은 것이 보통 피리와 미묘하게 다르다는 점을 지적하며, 경주 사람들이야 이런 모양의 피리를 일상적으로 어려서부터 접해 왔으니 익숙하게 다룰 수 있었겠지만 경주 외의 다른 지방 사람들은 신라옥적과 같은 모양의 피리를 다루는 데에 익숙하지 않아서 연주가 서툴러서 소리가 나지 않았던 것뿐이고, 덤으로 경주 사람들이 이런 형태의 피리에 익숙하다는 게 알려지면 경주를 떠나 다른 지방으로 누차 불려 올라가게 될 것이 귀찮아서, 그리고 다른 지방에 옥적이 넘어가 다시는 돌아오지 못하게 될 것을 염려해서 지어낸 거짓말이라고 해석했다.

줄거리
문벌 높은 집안의 귀한 무남독녀로 태어난 배뱅이는 태어날 때 어머니의 꿈에서 비둘기 목을 비틀어 버렸다고 하여 이름을 배뱅이라고 지었다. 귀엽고 곱게 잘 자랐으나, 18세에 우연히 병을 얻어 죽었다. 배뱅이 부모가 딸의 혼령을 위로하는 넋풀이를 하는데 엉터리 박수무당이 교묘한 수단을 써서 거짓 넋풀이를 해주고 많은 재물을 얻어 가진다는 내용이다.

의미
관서·해서 지방에서 성행되는 놀이이다. 배뱅이란 이 놀이에 나오는 여자 주인공의 이름이니, 그는 문벌이 높은 집의 무남독녀로 태어나서 곱게 자라 열여덟살에 우연히 병을 얻어 죽었다고 한다. 이 처녀를 낳을 때 어머니의 꿈에 비둘기 목을 비틀어 버렸다고 해서 이름을 배뱅이라고 지었다는 것이다. 이 놀이의 내용은 죽은 배뱅이의 혼령을 엉터리 박수무당이 교묘한 수단을 써서 거짓으로 넋풀이굿을 해주고 많은 재물을 얻어 가진다는 것이다. 무격(巫覡)의 일면상을 보여 주는 놀이이다.
특히 이 배뱅이굿의 창조(唱調)는 관서지방 무당들의 노랫소리 그대로이다. 이 배뱅이굿은 최근세에 형성된 것으로 보이는데 지금 전승되는 것은 평안도 김관준 계통을 이은 이은관(李殷官) <배뱅이굿>과 황해도 문창규(文昌圭) 계통을 이은 양소운(楊蘇云) <배뱅이굿>이 있으며, 이은관 <배뱅이굿>은 중요무형문화재 제29호 서도소리로 지정되었다. 반주는 장구 하나를 쓰는 것이나, 바라 · 피리 · 젓대 · 해금을 쓰기도 한다. 장단은 굿거리 · 볶는타령 · 막장단 · 중모리(산염불장단) 등으로 되어 있고, 소리는 수심가토리가 주가 되어 경토리(京畿民謠調) · 메나리토리도 쓰이는데, 양소운 <배뱅이굿>에는 육자배기토리가 끼어 있다. <배뱅이굿>에는 <산염불> · <자진염불> · <서도무가> 등의 서도민요도 있다.

전해오는 이야기
숙종 때에 경상도 태백산 아래 9대째 내려오는 무당 최씨라는 부자가 살았다. 어느 해 나라에서 귀천을 가리지 않고 과거를 보였으므로, 그도 이에 응시하여 급제하고 경상 감사 벼슬을 받았다. 그러나 부임 얼마 후 무당임이 탄로나 쫓겨나고, 황해도로 가서 최정승으로 행세하며 그곳에 사는 김, 이 두 정승과 형제의 의를 맺었다. 그런데 그들에게는 모두 혈육이 없었다. 어느 날 세 사람은 절에 가서 백일기도를 하여 각각 딸 하나씩을 낳았는데, 최정승은 딸의 이름을 ‘백의 백갑절’이라는 뜻으로 ‘배뱅[百百]이’라고 지었다.
이 셋은 어느덧 자라서 처녀가 되었다. 하루는 금강산 어느 절에서 나온 탁발승이 최정승 집에 왔는데, 배뱅이는 그 중에게 첫눈에 반하여 그를 불러들여서 벽장에 숨겨두고 함께 지냈다. 중은 머리를 기른 뒤 오겠다고 기약하고 떠난 후 다시 나타나지 않았다. 중을 기다리다 지친 배뱅이는 끝내 상사병을 앓다가 죽고 말았다. 최정승 내외는 딸 배뱅이의 넋이나마 불러보고 싶어 이를 이루어주는 사람에게는 재산의 절반을 나눠주겠다고 하였다. 이에 팔도의 이름난 무당들이 몰려들어 굿을 하였으나, 아무도 넋을 불러오지 못하였다. 그 때 지나가던 평양의 젊은 건달 부랑자가 무당 행세를 하여 넋을 불러들여 주었으므로, 최정승은 그에게 약속을 지켜 재산의 절반을 주었다는 것이다.

삼기
금척
금척(金尺)은 박혁거세 거서간이 즉위하자 하늘에서 금으로 만든 자를 선물로 내려주었는데 병든 사람을 재면 병이 낫고 죽은 사람을 재면 사람이 다시 살아나는 신비스러운 것이다. 이 소문이 중국의 한나라 형제에게까지 가자 황제는 금자가 탐이나 사신을 보내어 보여줄 것을 청했다. 낭패를 당한 신라에서는 왕과 신하가 의논하여 금자를 땅에 묻고 봉분을 만들고 사신은 금자가 묻혔다는 무덤을 찾아봐서 똑같은 무덤이 많고 뾰죽한 방법이 없어서 그대로 돌아가 버렸다. 그 후 금자가 묻혀있는 곳이라 마을이름도 금척이라 불리고 있다.

옥적
옥적(玉笛)은 신라 제31대 신문왕의 아버지 문무왕을 위해 동해 바닷가에 감은사지를 짓고 난 다음에 해룡이 된 문무왕과, 천신이 되니 김유신의 혼령이 서로 힘을 합쳐 용을 시켜 보낸 대나무로 피리를 만들었는데, 이것을 만파식적이라고 한다. 경주 관아에서 본관해 오다가 조선 중엽에 잃어 버리는 것을 동경관의 담장 밑을 파다가 우연히 찾아 내었다고 감은 옥적은 세동강 난 것을 은으로 이었고, 옥피리는 한 쌍을 해두어야 좋다고 해서 그 뒤의 경주 부윤이 황색 옥피리를 만들었다.

화주
화주(火珠)는 빛깔이 수정과 같고 햇볕을 받아 비추면 솜에 불이 붙었다고 한다. 이 보물은 선덕여왕이 지니고 있던 수정 돋보기로 태양에서 불씨를 얻고, 그 뒤에 백률사에 보관하여 지금은 전하지 아니한다.

팔괴
남산부석
남산부석(南山浮石)은 버선을 거꾸로 세워 놓은 것처럼 보이기 때문에 버선바위라고 부르기도 하며, 남산의 국사골에 있다. 큰 바위 위에 또 한 개의 바위가 얹혀 있는데, 실을 넣어 당겨보면 바위가 공중에 뜬 채로 있기 때문에 실이 빠져 나온다는 속설이 있다.

문천도사
문천도사(蚊川倒沙)는 문천(남천)의 모래가 너무나 부드러워 물은 아래로 흘러가지만 모래는 물을 거슬러 올라가는 것처럼 보인다는 것이다. 문천은 예로부터 모기내 또는 물개(모래)내라고 불렸다.

계림황엽
계림황엽(鷄林黃葉)은 계림의 나뭇잎이 움이 트면서 붉은색을 띄는 것이다.

압지부평
압지부평(鴨池浮萍)은 안압지에 부평초가 무더기로 떠다니는데, 뿌리가 땅에 닿지 않은 채 바람에 밀려 다니는 모양이 또한 장관이다.

백률송순
백률송순(栢栗松筍)은 소나무에는 순이 돋아나지 않는데 백률사에 있는 소나무는 가지를 치면 거기서 새순이 난다.

금장낙안
금장낙안(金丈落雁)의 금장은 서천과 북천(알내)이 합치는 곳으로 임금이 노닐던 금장대를 말한다. 높은 바위에 올라서 바라보면 서라벌이 한눈에 굽어 뵈는데, 애기청소 푸른 물에 비치는 전망이 아름다워 날아가던 기러기도 잠시 내려서 쉬어갔다고 한다.

불국영지
불국영지(佛國影池)은 아사달과 아사녀의 전설이 얽혀있는 영지에는 날이 밝으면 불국사의 전경이 물에 비치는데, 다보탑만이 보이고 석가탑은 비치지 않으므로, 사람들은 석가탑을 무영탑이라 부른다.

나원백탑
나원백탑(羅原白塔)은 현곡면 나원리에 있는 나원리 오층석탑이  백색의 화강암으로 만들어져 오래도록 흰 빛깔을 유지하는 것을 일컫는다.

서산모연
서산모연(西山慕煙)의 서산은 선도산인데, 서라벌의 서쪽을 지키는 성산으로 선도성모가 계신 곳으로 크게 제사를 지내던 곳이다. 석양이 비친 노을이 빼어나 서산모연이라고 한다.

금오만하
금오만하(金鰲晩霞) : 금오산(남산)은 언제나 아지랑이가 끼어 있다. 아지랑이가 저녁놀에 반사되어 연분홍 빛으로 피어오르는 광경은 다른 곳에서는 볼 수 없는 신비한 아름다움이다.

생애
《삼국유사》를 쓴 일연은 혁거세 거서간이 하늘에서 강림하였다고 기록하였다. 사로국 6부 촌장들이 임금을 세우는 회의를 하던 중 하늘에서 백마가 운반해온 큰 알에서 혁거세 거서간이 나왔다는 내용으로 서술하였다. 그러나 일연은 이 이야기 옆에 작은 글씨로 주석을 단다. 서술자가 말하기를 “서술성모(西述聖母)가 혁거세 거서간을 낳았다”는 내용을 별첨하였다. 여기서 서술성모는 선도성모와 같은 여신이다. 선도산의 다른 이름이 서술산이기 때문이다.
《삼국유사》에 의하면 본래 제실(帝室)의 딸로, 이름이 사소(娑蘇)였는데, 신선술을 얻어 해동에 와서 오랫동안 돌아가지 않았다. 사소부인의 출신지는 정확하게 전하지는 않으나 그녀가 정착하였다는 형산이란 서형산(西兄山), 선도산(仙桃山)이라고도 부르는 산으로, 부여 황실의 딸인 파소가 혁거세 거서간 어머니로 진한 사로국 지역에 정착하였다 한다.
경주 국립공원 (서악지구) 서악동에는 '성모사 유허비'가 전해온다. 신모가 처음 ""진한에 와서 성자를 낳아 동국 최초의 왕이 되니, 그가 바로 박혁거세와 알영의 이성이었다.""는 것이다.
고려 정화년간(1111~1117)에 송나라에 갔던 김부식이 우신관이란 곳에 갔더니 여인상이 봉안되어 있었다.  당시 고려에 왔던 송나라 사신 왕양도 성모를 제사지내면서 ""신현조방지"", 즉 '어진 사람을 낳아 나라를 세웠다'는 글을 남겼다. 
서정주의 시 「꽃밭의 독백(獨白)」은 사소부인을 소재로 한 작품이다.

지리산 성모설
점필재 김종직은 사소부인이 지리산의 산신인 지리산 성모와 동일인물이라고도 봤다. 점필재 김종직의 유두유록에는 지리산 천왕봉에 올랐다가 내려올 때의 일을 기록해 두었다.
성모묘에 들어가 성모에게 잔을 올렸다. 천지가 맑게 개어 산천이 활짝 열린 것을 사례하였다.
점필재는 이를 석가모니의 어머니 마야부인이라는 설, 박혁거세의 어머니인 선도성모, 왕건의 어머니 위숙왕후설 등이 있다고 밝힌다. 점필재는 그 중 선도성모설이 유력하다 하였다.

선도산 사찰 중수 설화
삼국유사의 권5, 6에는 선도산 성모가 선도산에 법당을 중수하려는 지혜라는 여자 불교승려의 꿈에 나타나 불전에 쓰라고 금 10근을 시주했다는 전설도 전한다.

선도성모가 불교 행사를 좋아하다. 진평왕 시대에 지혜라는 여승이 있어, 어진 행실이 많았고 안흥사에 거주했다. 이에 지혜가 새로 불전을 수축하고자 하였으나 힘이 부족하여 못하더니, 꿈에 한 선녀가 아름다운 자태로 머리를 보옥으로 꾸미고 와서 말하기를, ""나는 선도산의 신모이다. 네가 불전을 수리하고자 하니, 기꺼이 금 10근을 시주하여 돕고자 한다."" 하였다.仙桃聖母隨喜佛事 眞平王朝 有比丘尼名智惠 多賢行 住安興寺 擬新修佛殿而力未也 夢一女仙風儀婥約 珠翠飾鬟 來慰曰 我是仙桃山神母也 喜汝欲修佛殿 願施金十斤以助之

비로사진공대사보법탑비 (939년)
대사의 휘(諱)는 ▨운(▨運)이요, 속성은 김씨이니, 계림 사람이다. 그의 선조는 성한(聖韓)에서 강등하여 나물(𨚗勿)에서 일어났고, 근본에서 지말(枝末)까지 약 백세(百世)동안 가유(嘉猷)를 끼쳤다.

생애
성한의 출생 년대는 정확하게 알려지지 않았으며, 출생한 곳도 정확하게 알려져 있지 않다. 939년에 건립된 진공대사 보법탑비에 따르면, 성한의 선조들은 어디선가 내려왔다는 뜻의 기선강자성한(其先降自聖韓)이라 하였다. 성한은 문무왕릉비, 김인문묘비명, 흥덕왕릉비, 진철대사탑비문(眞澈大師塔碑文), 원주 흥법사지 진공대사탑 및 석관(原州 興法寺址 眞空大師塔 및 石棺) 등에 등장하는 인물이다. 비석과 금석문에 따르면, 성한은 신라 김씨 왕조의 시조 격으로 나타나며, 태조(太祖)라고 호칭되기도 한다. 《삼국사기》와 《삼국유사》에는 성한이 아닌 김알지를 김씨의 시조로 서술하고 있는 것과 달리, 금석문 속에서는 김알지가 등장하지 않고 성한을 김씨 왕실의 시조로 지칭한다. 신라 당대인들은 성한을 신라 김씨의 시조로 보았다. 이에 따라 성한의 정체에 대하여 많은 주장이 있어왔다.
《삼국사기》와 《삼국유사》 등 문헌 사료에는 등장하지 않는데,  《삼국사기》와 《삼국유사》 등은 고려 이후에 편찬된 사료인데 《삼국사기》에는 세한, 《삼국유사》에는 열한으로 나타난다. 문무왕릉비문에는 성한을 태조(太祖)라 하고, 성한왕이 가계상 문무대왕의 15대조라 하며, 흥덕왕릉비문에도 성한을 태조라고 지칭하는 한편, 흥덕왕은 그의 24대손이라 하였다. 김인문의 묘비문에는 태조 한왕으로 나타난다.
한편 경주 김씨나 신라 김씨의 족보 및 《삼국사기》, 《삼국유사》의 미추왕 편에는 세한 또는 성한의 최종 벼슬이 이찬이었다는 것만 간략하게 수록되어 있다. 미추 이사금이 아닌 그 4대조인 성한에게 태조라는 묘호를 추존한 이유는 알려져 있지 않다.

정체
성한왕이라는 인물이 《삼국사기》와 《삼국유사》를 비롯한 사서에 전혀 나타나지 않기 때문에, 그 정체에 대해 다양한 가설이 제안되고 있다.
첫째로 성한을 김알지와 동일인물로 보는 가설이 있다. 이 경우 성(星)=""김(金)"", 漢(한)=""알<閼>"", 王(왕)=""지<智>""에 대응시켜 성한왕<星漢王>과 김알지<金閼智>를 동일인으로 비정하기도 한다. 김정희 등이 이러한 견해를 취했다.
둘째로 《삼국사기》와 《삼국유사》에서 알지의 아들로 등장하는 세한(勢漢) 혹은 열한(熱漢)과 동일인물로 보는 견해가 있다. 이 경우 음운의 유사성, 《삼국사기》 및 《삼국유사》의 계보에서 문무왕의 15대조로 세한이 나타나는 점 등을 근거로 삼는다. 경주 김씨 세보 역시 이러한 주장을 취하여 세한(勢漢)으로 기록되어 있고, 다른 이름으로 열한(熱漢), 성한(星漢), 성한(聖漢) 등의 이름이 있다고 전해진다.
셋째로 알지의 7세손이자 《삼국사기》 및 《삼국유사》에 따르면, 김씨 중 최초로 왕위에 오른 미추왕(味鄒王)으로 보는 견해가 있다.
기타 석씨 중 최초로 왕위에 오른 탈해왕(新羅王)으로 보는 견해, 박혁거세로 보는 견해 등이 있다. 
한편, 문무왕 비문에 따르면, 성한은 투후 김일제와 연관이 있는 것으로 추정된다. 대당고김씨부인묘명 등을 근거로 “투후(秺侯) 제천지윤(祭天之胤)이 7대를 전하여”(5행), “15대조 성한왕(星漢王)은 그 바탕이 하늘에서 내리고”(6행)라는 두 구절을 직접적으로 연관이 있는 것으로 해석하여 투후 김일제의 7대손을 성한이라 비정하기도 한다. 일부 재야사학자들은 실제로 김일제의 후손들이 중국에서 패망하여 신라로 이주하였다고 주장하며, 그 상세한 과정을 소개하기도 한다. 그러나 역사학계에서는 성한과 김일제를 관련시킨 기록은 신라 왕족의 관념적인 시조의식의 소산으로 보고 있다. 전근대에는 가계를 신성시하기 위해 고대의 전설적인 제왕 또는 유명한 위인들을 시조로 간주하는 일이 많았으므로, 김일제 후손설은 사실로 보기 어렵다는 것이다.
사망 연대와 날짜, 사망 장소는 미상이고, 능지와 시호에 대한 것도 미상이다. 사후 신라 김씨 왕실은 그를 태조라 칭했으며, 그가 어떤 이유로 왕(王)으로 추존되었는지 여부는 미상이다.

가족 관계
신라 김씨 선원세계도에 따르면, 흥덕왕은 그의 21세손이다. 그런데 흥덕왕릉 묘비문에 따르면, 흥덕왕은 성한의 24세손이다. 문무왕은 신라 김씨 선원세계도나 《삼국사기》, 《심국유사》의 기록으로는 그의 15세손이고 문무왕릉비문에도 15세손으로 나타난다.

대중문화
일지매는 명나라 말기 중국에서 읽히던 소설 이각박안경기 39편에 나오는 주인공으로 등장하거나 청나라 초 중국에서 읽히던 화본소설 환희원가의 맨 마지막 회인 24편에 나오는 소설상의 도적이었다.

조수삼의 추재기이
조선 순조 때의 문인 조수삼의 저작 《추재기이》에서 일지매에 대해 다루고 있다.

一枝梅盜之俠也. 每盜貪官汚吏之財. 自外來者. 散施於不能養生送死者. 而飛簷走壁. 捷若神鬼. 被盜之家. 固不知何盜也. 而乃自作朱標刻一枝梅爲記. 盖不欲移怨於他也.일지매는 도둑 중의 협객이다. 매양 탐관오리의 부정한 뇌물을 훔쳐 양생송사(養生送死)가 어려운 사람들에게 나누어준다. 처마와 처마 사이를 날고 벽에 붙어 날래기가 귀신이다. 도둑을 맞은 집은 어떤 도둑이 들었는지 모를 것이지만 스스로 자기의 표지를 매화 한 가지(一枝梅)를 붉게 찍어 놓는다. 대개 혐의를 남에게 옮기지 않으려는 까닭이었다.

당시 조선시대는 중국 소설이 열풍이었다고 한다. 일부에서는 일지매를 자처하는 도적이 있었다 한다. 승정원일기 숙종 42년에 사로잡힌 일지매를 자처하는 도적의 처벌에 대해 논하는 일이 있다.

줄거리
옛날, 인색하고 심보 고약한 장자(큰 부자)가 살고 있었다. 하루는 장자가 집 외양간에서 쇠똥을 치우고 있었는데, 지나가던 스님이 와서 장자에게 시주를 부탁하였다. 그러자 장자는 바랑에 쌀 대신 쇠똥을 바랑에 퍼주었다.이것을 본 장자의 며느리가 장자 몰래 쌀을 퍼 바랑에 담아 주며 장자의 무례함을 사과하였다.
그러자 스님은 며느리에게 ""지금 곧 자신을 따라 피해야 한다. 피할때는 절대로 뒤를 돌아보지 말라.""고 말했다. 며느리는 곧 어린아이를 들쳐업고 집을 떠나 산을 오르는데 뒤에서 벼락이 치는 듯 천지를 뒤흔드는 큰 소리가 들려왔다. 그 소리에 며느리는 스님의 당부를 잊고 집이 걱정되어 뒤를 돌아보고 말았다.
그런데 장자의 집은 큰 연못으로 변해있었다. 며느리는 뒤를 돌아본 순간 등에 업고 있던 어린아이와 함께 그 자리에서 돌로 변해버렸다. 그 후 비가 오는 날이면 장자의 집이었던 연못에서 다듬이질 소리가 들려온다고 한다.

의미
충남 공주시 우성면 옥성리의 대물터처럼 지명에 얽힌 지명설화의 한 유형이지만, 인색한 부자가 중에게 쇠똥을 준 것을 부끄럽게 생각하여 몰래 시주한 장자의 며느리가 중이 제시한 금기를 어겨 바위가 되었다는 이야기가 모두 함께 하고 있다. 구약성서 창세기 19장에 나오는, 아브라함의 조카인 롯 이 하느님의 천사들을 빵을 주어 대접하고 난폭한 주민들에게서 보호했더니, 천사들이 ""소돔과 고모라가 야훼께서 심판하시어 망할 것이니 어서 피하고, 뒤를 돌아보지 마시오.""라고 이야기한 소돔과 고모라 이야기와 비슷한 내용이다. 롯의 아내가 뒤돌아보았더니 소금기둥이 되었다는 이야기도 닮았다.

전해오는 이야기
인색한 부자가 지나가는 중을 학대하였더니, 그 중이 부자에게 더 부자가 될 수 있는 방법을 가르쳐 준다고 속이고는 현재 발복(發福)의 근원인 명당의 혈(穴)을 자르게 하였다. 탐욕스러운 부자는 욕심이 나서 그대로 하였다가 망해 버렸다는 이야기는 징벌의 수단으로 풍수리지설로 이용하여 내려오고 있다. 유사한 설화로는 자기 집 종을 학대하자 종의 자식이 집을 나가 풍수지리를 공부하고 돌아와서 주인집의 명당혈(明堂穴)을 자르게 하여 망하게 하였다는 설화도 있다.

전설의 고향 관련
전설의 고향은 애꿎은 사람이 죽임을 당해서 그 원한 때문에 구천을 떠도는 귀신인 원귀가 자신을 해한 사람에게 다시 나타나 복수하는 일이 거의 대부분이다. 하지만 그 중에서 〈방울소리〉 부분에는 원귀를 잡아들이고 양귀가 많은 쪽에 묻으면 원귀에게 불리하니까 한 발짝도 나가지 못한다는 얘기도 있다. 그리고 〈깍지손〉에서도 스님이 귀신을 쫓기 위해 주위에 깃발을 꽂는 내용도 있다.
유일무이하게 사람의 전생과 후생의 이야기를 담은 깍지손에서는 옛날 조선 시대에 사람이 죽어 후생에 다시 일본인들로 환생하여 전생에 이미 임진왜란 때 일본에게 죽어 양팔을 잘린 채 죽은 원귀의 내용을 담고 있다. 또한 이처럼 전생과 후생의 이야기를 담은 시카고타자기와 도깨비 등같은 드라마가 존재한다.
귀신이 등장하는 전설의 고향이래도 때로는 코미디처럼 웃어주는 영화가 있는데 대표적으로 최근 2008년에 방영된 사신이야기가 있다. 사신이야기는 저승사자가 이승 사람들을 저승으로 잡아들이기 위해 기록된 명부를 잃어버려서 저승사자가 염라대왕에게 혼나는 장면, 오히려 저승사자가 무서운 행동이 아닌 지금의 대한민국의 사람들이 하는 행동 반응, 그리고 저승사자가 이승에서 다른 사람들에게 보여서 쫓기고 당하는 이야기로 가득하다. 오자영과 함께 잃어버린 명부를 되찾기 위해 명부를 전직 관찰사 이대감이 중국의 보물 문서로 잘못 알고 가지고 있었던 명부를 되찾았고 거기에 전직 관찰사 이대감이 가지고 있던 보물까지 빼앗는 이야기다. 그러나 정작 오자영을 저승으로 데려와야 그 저승사자가 저승사자 면제를 하여 그걸 오자영이 후임으로 대신 하는 기회를 저승사자가 그만 되찾은 명부에 오자영에 쓰여진 부분 중 十(십)자를 千(천)으로 연장시켜 오자영의 수명을 3001세로 늘리는 바람에 계속 저승사자 노릇을 하고 오자영은 그 덕에 3000년을 더 살면서 놓치고 만다.
2008 전설의 고향 마지막회에서 한 나그네가 대낮에 왠 여자를 만나는데 이 여자가 나그네보고 쉬다 가라는 말을 하면서 나그네 품에 안기는데 모습이 푸르게 변하면서 자신이 귀신이라는 정체를 밝혀 씩 웃으면서 2008 전설의 고향 마지막회가 끝난다.
2019년 8월부터 KBS아카이브 디지털 프로젝트의 일환으로 유튜브 채널 옛날티비를 통해 다시 공개되었다.

참고 사항
당초 월화드라마 《조광조》 후속으로 기획되었으나 원작자인 임충 작가가 본인의 또 다른 작품인 SBS 《만강》과 같은 시간에 방영되는 것을 원하지 않자 수목 미니시리즈 《컬러》 후속이었던 《신고합니다》와  편성을 맞바꿨다.
당초 18부작으로 기획됐지만 높은 인기에 힘입어 2편 늘린 20부작으로 종영 예정이었다. 그러나 후속작인 《머나먼 나라》에서 김한수 역으로 낙점된 이정재가 영화 《불새》로 바쁘게 되어 제안을 포기하여 캐스팅의 난항을 겪자 20부작에서 4편 더 늘려 24부작으로 막을 내렸다.

줄거리 : 제주 구좌읍 김녕리 마을 동쪽에 큰 굴이 있는데, 여기에서 큰 뱀이 살았다고 하여 '뱀굴[蛇窟]'이라고 한다. 이 뱀에게 매년 처녀 한 사람을 제물로 올려 큰굿을 했다. 만일 굿을 하지 않으면 뱀이 곡식밭을 다 휘저어 버려 대흉년이 들었다. 그런데 양반집에서는 딸을 내놓지 않았기 때문에 평민의 딸이 희생되게 마련이었다. 그래서 평민의 딸은 시집을 갈 수가 없었다. 그즈음, 조선 중종 때 서린이라는 판관이 제주에 부임해 왔다. 서린 판관은 뱀굴의 소문을 듣고 괴이한 일이라며 분개하였다. 곧 술, 떡, 처녀를 올려 굿을 하라 하고, 몸소 군졸을 거느리고 뱀굴에 이르렀다. 굿이 시작되어 한참이 지나자 과연 어마어마한 크기의 뱀이 나와 술과 떡을 먹고 처녀를 잡아먹으려고 하였다. 이때 서 판관은 군졸과 함께 달려들어 창검으로 뱀을 찔러 죽였다. 이것을 본 심방(무당)이 “빨리 말을 달려 성(현재의 제주 읍성) 안으로 가십시오. 어떤 일이 있어도 뒤를 돌아보아선 안 됩니다.”라고 일러 주었다. 서 판관은 말에 채찍을 놓아 무사히 성의 동문 밖까지 이르렀다. 이때 군졸 한 사람이 “뒤쪽으로 피비[血雨]가 옵니다.”라고 외쳤다. “무슨 비가, 피비가 오는 법이 있느냐?”라고 하며 서 판관이 무심코 뒤를 돌아보았다. 그러자마자 서 판관은 그 자리에 쓰러져 죽었다. 죽은 뱀의 피가 하늘에 올라가 비가 되어 서 판관의 뒤를 쫓아온 것이다. 그 후로 판관 서린의 기념비를 세우게 되었다.

당초 프로포즈 후속 월화극으로 기획되었으나 1997년 6월 14일부터 주말 오후 9시에 방영되어 온 2부작 단막극 <테마 드라마>가 소재 고갈 뿐 아니라  동시간대 SBS 꿈의 궁전과 그 후속작인 이웃집 여자 때문에 시청률 부진을 면치 못하자(1997년 7월 6일이 마지막 방송) 이 작품 대신 대체 편성되었는데 이에 대해 KBS 측은 ""'전설의 고향'이 밤 9시대에 맞는 가족 드라마이며 방송시기가 여름방학을 끼고 있다""라 설명했으며 이 때문에 새 드라마 제작이 불투명해진 프로포즈는 애초 기획한 10부작에서 4편 늘린 14부작으로 막을 내렸다.
시간대를 옮겨 편성된 <97 전설의 고향>은 당초 16부작으로 기획되었으나 초반에는 높은 인기를 누린 전작 꿈의 궁전 덕택에 20% 이상의 시청률을 기록했지만 방영 전의 갑작스런 연출자 교체, 독창성 문제 등으로 홍역을 치뤘던  SBS 이웃집 여자를 시청률 면에서 앞섰던 탓인지 4편 늘린 20회로 종영 계획이었다.
하지만 4부 늘린 24부작으로 연장하는 듯 했으나 또다시 4편 늘린 28부작으로 끝낼 계획이었고 이렇게 한 것은 당초 초원의 빛 후속 TV 소설로 기획되었으나 스타급 연기자 캐스팅 문제, 광고가 붙지 않는다는 등의 이유로  시간대를 변경하여 1997년 10월 4일 첫 회가 나갈 뻔한 아씨의 캐스팅 문제 때문이었으며 우여곡절 끝에  아씨 역은 김혜선, 아씨의 남편 긍재 역은 최재성, 아씨 소작인의 아들 수만 역은 허준호가 낙점됐다.
그러나 김혜선이 노역까지 해야 되는 아씨 역에 대한 부담 탓인지 출연을 고사한 데 이어 수만 역의 허준호가 1997년 9월 28일 올린 결혼식 스케줄과 드라마 촬영 일정이 겹쳐 포기하는 바람에 제작진은 설득 끝에  이응경을 아씨 역으로 낙점시켰으며 이 과정에서 최재성이 허준호가 분할 뻔한 수만 역으로 갔지만  최재성을 대신할 긍재 역 배우의 섭외 문제로 어려움을 겪었다.
그 후 아씨는 천신만고 끝에 선우재덕이  긍재 역으로 캐스팅됐다.
이 때문에 28부작으로 끝낼 계획이었던  <97 전설의 고향>은  2편 축소된 26부작으로 막을 내렸다.

생애
《삼국사기》에 따르면, 지백호는 사로국 화산(花山)에 내려와 사로국의 모체가 되는 여섯 고을 중 하나인 취산진지촌의 촌장이 되었다고 한다. 기원전 69년 3월에 지백호와 알평(謁平)·소벌도리(蘇伐都利)·구례마(俱禮馬:仇禮馬)·지타(祗陀)·호진(虎珍)의 6촌장이 함께 각기의 자제들을 이끌고 알천(閼川) 기슭에 모여 덕이 있는 사람을 군왕으로 삼고, 나라를 세워 도읍을 정할 것을 의논하였다. 이때 양산(楊山) 아래 나정(蘿井) 곁에서 나는 말 울음소리를 듣고 혁거세를 얻었으며, 기원전 57년(혁거세왕 1) 혁거세를 왕으로 추대하여 나라를 세우고 국호를 서라벌(徐羅伐)이라 하였다. 진지촌은 유리왕 9년(서기 32년)에 본피부(本彼部)로 개칭되었고 정씨 또는 최씨 성을 하사받았다.
한편 경주 정씨 족보에 따르면, 지백호는 기원전 117년에 화산에 강림하였다고 한다. 유리왕 때 성씨를 하사받은 것은 지백호의 4대손인 동충이라고 기록하고 있다. 법흥왕 때 문화(文和)라는 시호를 받았고, 무열왕 때 감문왕에 추봉되었다고 한다.

기타
한편, 삼국유사에는 최씨(崔氏)의 성을 받아 최씨의 조상이 되었다고 한다. 삼국사기 유리이사금 편에는 ""고허부는 사량부로 고쳤으며 성은 최씨, 간진부는 본피부로 고쳤으며 성은 정씨 로 정하였다."" 고 되어 있고 삼국유사 혁거세편에는 ""돌산(突山) 고허촌(高墟村) 촌장(村長) 소벌도리(蘇伐都利)가 사량부 정씨(沙梁部鄭氏)의 조상, 자산(觜山) 진지촌(珍支村) 촌장(村長) 지백호(智伯虎)가 본피부 최씨(本彼部崔氏)의 조상이 되었다""고 되어 있어 하사받은 성이 서로 바뀌어 있다. 경주 정씨 측에서는 삼국사기의 기록을 취하여 정씨로 사성을 받았다고 본다.

생애
젊은 시절
마립간의 칭호를 마지막으로 사용한 임금이다. 성은 김씨이며, 이름은 지철로라고 한다. 내물 마립간의 증손자이며 할아버지는 갈문왕 김복호이고, 아버지는 습보 갈문왕(習寶)이며 어머니는 조생부인 김씨(鳥生夫人 金氏)이다. 복호의 형은 눌지 마립간으로, 그는 소지 마립간의 재종 아우이다.
부인은 연제부인(延帝夫人) 박씨이며, 소지 마립간이 아들이 없이 죽어 64세에 왕위를 이었다. 514년 죽은 뒤 시호를 지증이라 하였는데, 이때 이후로 신라의 시호법이 시작되었다.
영일냉수리신라비(迎日冷水里新羅碑)에 의하면 503년에 사탁부(沙啄部) 소속에 지도로 갈문왕(至都盧葛文王)으로 기록되었다. 왕으로 즉위하기 전에 갈문왕에 제수된 것이다. 서자 산종만이 있었던 소지 마립간은 사위인 원종을 염두에 두고 자신의 사촌들을 제치고, 6촌이자 사돈인 그를 차기 왕위 계승자로 내정했던 것이다.

치세 기간
500년 음력 11월에 왕이 즉위했다고 한다. 그러나 삼국유사는 남제 영원 3년(501년)에 왕이 즉위했다는 기록을 함께 전하고 있다. 502년 순장을 금하고, 신궁에서 직접 제사를 지냈다. 음력 3월에 주주(州主)와 군주(郡主)에게 각각 명하여 농사를 권장케 하였고, 처음으로 소를 부려 논밭갈이를 하였다. 503년에 국호를 신로(新盧)·사라(斯羅)·서나(徐那)·서야(徐耶)·서라(徐羅)·서벌(徐伐) 등에서 “신라”(新羅)로 통일하였다.
즉위 초부터 그는 각종 제도와 국가 내부 체제 개편을 추진하였다. 504년 음력 4월 상복법을 제정하고, 음력 9월에 파리, 미실, 진덕, 골화 등 12성을 쌓는 등 고대 국가로서의 기반을 다졌다.
509년에는 시사(市肆, 혹은 시전)를 관리 감독하는 관청인 동시전(東市典)을 설치하였다. 이리하여 무역과 상인들의 거래를 단속, 통제하였다.
또한 처음으로 지방에 군주(軍主)를 두었다. 512년 실직주(悉直州)의 군주이자 이찬 이사부로 하여금 우산국을 복속시켜 해마다 토산물을 공물로 바치게 하였다.
한편 삼국사기와 삼국유사에는 기골이 장대하고 체구가 커서 배우자가 없었던 지증왕에게는 알맞은 배우자가 없었는데 신하를 보내 신라 국내를 수소문하던 중 연제부인(延帝夫人)을 발견하여 배우자로 삼았다는 전설이 전한다.

설화
지증왕설화는 《삼국유사》 기이편(紀異篇)과 《삼국사기》 김유신조에 수록되어 있다.

기타
신하들이 왕비가 될 여성을 찾으러 다니던 중 경주 남산의 연못에 큰 똥덩이가 있는 것을 보고, 그 큰 똥의 주인이 여성이라면 왕을 감당할 것이라 보고 수소문한 끝에 이찬 박등혼의 딸이라 하였다. 이에 신하들이 등혼의 딸을 간택하여 왕비로 들이니 그가 왕비인 연제부인이라는 것이다.
이 설화는 다만 《삼국사기》에는 소개되어 있지 않으며, ""몸이 크고 담력이 뛰어났다""고만 밝히고 있다. 박노자 교수는 정통성이 약했던 지증왕이, 고대인의 성기 숭상 문화와 연관지어 위상을 높였다는 해석을 제기하고 있다.
왕릉은 문헌상 비정되는 곳은 없으나, 현대 고고학적 연구를 통해 천마총이 지증왕의 능으로 보고 있다. 피장자의 키가 160cm 내외로 추정된다.

줄거리
콩쥐가 일찍 모친을 여의고 아버지가 계모를 얻었는데 계모에게는 팥쥐라는 딸이 있었다. 팥쥐는 콩쥐보다 한 살 아래 동생인데, 얼굴이 밉고 마음씨가 고약했다. 계모는 팥쥐를 예뻐하고 콩쥐에게만 힘든 집안일을 다 시키니 콩쥐의 고생이 이만저만 아니었다. 나무로 된 호미를 주고 밭을 메어 놓으라 강요하고, 하루는 팥쥐 모녀가 콩쥐에게 마을 잔치에 못 가게 하려고 콩쥐에게 강피를 찌어놓으라 강요하고, 밑 빠진 독에 물을 채워놓으라고 하였다. 하지만 독에 밑이 빠진 걸 안 콩쥐는 너무 슬펐다.
콩쥐가 물이 새는 독 앞에서 울고 있으니 두꺼비가 나와 깨진 독을 등으로 막아 물을 채울 수 있게 해주었고, 견우가 나타나서 밭메기를 도와주었으며, 직녀는 콩쥐에게 비단옷하고 꽃신을 짜주고, 참새들이 날아와서 강피를 쪼아 찌어주었다. 콩쥐가 그것들을 차려입고 마을 잔치에 갈 준비를 했다. 잔치에 황급히 가다가 그만 꽃신 한 짝이 벗겨졌는데 뒤따라온 김씨 감사(벼슬 이름)가 그것을 주워보고, ‘이 신의 주인이 나의 아내가 될 사람이다.’ 하고 꽃신의 주인을 찾아 잔칫집에 온 사람들에게 차례로 꽃신을 신겨보고 마지막에 콩쥐가 신어서 발에 딱 맞아 콩쥐를 부인으로 맞게 되었다.
김 감사에게 시집가 잘 살고 있는 콩쥐를 보며 계모와 팥쥐가 못된 꾀를 부리며 작당한다. 여름이 되자 팥쥐가 내아에 사는 콩쥐를 찾아가 사과하는 척하고 같이 연못에서 목욕하자고 꼬드겨 콩쥐를 물에 빠뜨려 익사시킨다. 그리고 팥쥐가 콩쥐의 옷을 입고 별당에서 콩쥐 행세를 한다. 돌아온 김 감사가 달라진 얼굴을 보고 놀라 물어보니 팥쥐가 햇볕을 쐬어서 콩멍석에 엎어져서 그렇게 됐다고 거짓말을 했다.
어느 날 김 감사가 연못가를 거닐다가 유달리 큰 연꽃이 핀것을 보고 채취하여 신혼방에다 장식한다. 연꽃은 콩쥐의 원혼이 변해서 피어난 꽃이며, 꽃이 감사 앞에서는 화려하게 피지만 나중에 팥쥐가 연꽃을 보자 거기서 콩쥐의 유령이 나와 괴롭힌다. 이에 팥쥐가 연꽃을 아궁이에 넣고 불을 지른다. 그런데 이웃집 할멈이 아궁이 불씨를 빌리러 왔다가 아궁이에 든 영롱한 구슬을 보고 집으로 가져간다. 거기서 녹의홍상을 입은 콩쥐 귀신이 나타나 할멈에게 자초지종을 이야기하고, 할멈에게 생일상 차리는척 하여 감사를 초대하라고 말한다.
할멈은 자신의 생일이라고 김 감사를 초대하였고 일부러 길이가 서로 다른 젓가락을 놓아둔다. 그러자 김 감사가 음식 집으려고 젓가락을 보더니 할멈을 나무란다. 이때 벽장 뒤에서 ""젓가락 짝이 맞지 않은 것은 잘 아시면서 왜 사람 짝 다른 것은 모르시오""하고 말하더니 녹의홍상을 입은 콩쥐가 나타나 사연을 이야기한다.
김 감사가 집으로 돌아와 연못물을 다 퍼내자 정말 거기서 콩쥐의 시체가 발견되었고, 이내 살아났다. 분노한 김 감사는 당장에 팥쥐를 잡아 감옥에 가두고 조정에 상소를 올린다. 그리고 팥쥐를 팔다리를 묶어서 양쪽에서 소가 잡아 당기게 하는 거열형으로 찢어 죽인다. 그리고 죽은 팥쥐의 인육으로 젓갈을 담아 포장하여 팥쥐 엄마에게 보낸다. 계략대로 팥쥐가 성공하여 상을 보낸 줄 알고 젓갈을 먹었다가 죽은 팥쥐의 시체라는 것에 놀라 그 자리에서 울다가 죽어버린다. 콩쥐는 김 감사와 아들딸 낳고 잘 살았으며, 콩쥐의 아버지 또한 새 부인을 얻어서 잘 살았다.

소설의 가치
이 이야기는 세계적으로 널리 퍼져 있는 신데렐라형의 설화이다. 이러한 소재를 소설화하였다는 점에서 관심을 끌고 있다.
사또나 세자를 등장시키고 잔칫집 가는 중 신발을 잃어 주인을 찾으며 귀인과 혼인한 뒤 의붓동생의 흉계로 연못에 빠졌으나 연꽃과 구슬이 나타나서 사건전개의 단서가 되는 점, 결말에 가서 팥쥐와 계모에 대하여 철저한 응징을 가하는 점이 비슷한 유형이다.
특히 설화를 소재로 하면서도 설화와 구별된 이 소설은 신데렐라계 설화의 대부분이 주인공의 혼인으로 끝나는 데 비하여, 소설에서는 혼인 이후의 사건을 더 흥미롭게 다양한 모습으로 묘사하고 있다는 점이 다르다.
그러므로 이 소설의 가치는 악한 인간에 대한 응징과 선한 사람에게 보상을 주는 권선징악의 참다운 모습에 최대한 효과를 높여 단순한 설화를 윤리적인 주제로 재창조하였다는 점에 있다. 이것이 소설 <콩쥐팥쥐전>은 한국 전래의 <콩쥐팥쥐설화>에서 유래한 소설로 보게 되는 이유이다.

전해오는 이야기
조선시대 중엽 전라도 전주 근방에서 최만춘이라는 퇴리(退吏)와 부인 조씨, 딸 콩쥐가 즐겁게 살고 있었다. 그런데 불행히도 부인이 병을 얻어 죽자 과부 배씨를 후처로 맞게 되었다.
그 뒤 배씨는 팥쥐라는 딸을 낳게 되었는데 배씨는 갖은 방법으로 마음씨 착한 콩쥐를 학대했다. 그러나 마음씨 좋은 콩쥐는 뒤에 선녀의 도움으로 감사의 후실이 되었는데, 이를 질투한 배씨와 팥쥐는 흉계를 꾸며 콩쥐를 연못에 밀어넣어 죽게 했다.
그리고 팥쥐가 대신 콩쥐 행세를 하게 되었는데 한동안 이 사실을 모르던 감사는 기어코 자기 아내가 콩쥐가 아님을 알게 되었고 그 음모도 밝혀지게 되었다. 감사가 연못에 빠진 콩쥐의 시체를 찾아 내자 콩쥐는 되살아났다.
감사는 궁궐에 가서 모든 사실을 임금님께 알렸다. 임금님은 신하들에게 어명을 내려 계모와 팥쥐는 사약을 받았다는 내용의 이야기가 지금도 전북 완주군 이서면 은교리에 전해지고 있다.
하지만 콩쥐팥쥐전의 원전에서는 팥쥐에게 사약을 내리는 것이 아니라 팥쥐를 해형에 처하게 해 팥쥐를 죽여 젓갈로 만들고 그 젓갈을 팥쥐 엄마에게 팥쥐라는 사실을 알리지 않고 먹였다. 그 젓갈을 먹은 팥쥐의 엄마는 미쳐서 죽게 된다.

함흥차사의 경위
사건 경위
함흥차사를 보내고 태조가 답한 일을 한국사 학자 이덕일과 이회근의 연구를 바탕으로 재구성하면 다음과 같다.

1398년 태조 이성계가 정종에게 양위한 뒤 함흥으로 갔다.
1400년 태종 이방원이 즉위하다.
태종이 아버지 이성계를 모셔오려고 성석린을 차사로 보내었다.
1401년 4월 태조가 성석린의 청을 받아들여 한양으로 환궁한다.
1401년 11월 태조가 다시 한양을 떠난다.
태종이 왕사(王師) 무학대사를 차사로 함흥에 보내고, 태조는 환궁을 약속한다.
태조가 환궁하지 않고 소요산에 머문다.
1402년 1월 성석린을 다시 보내 환궁을 청하지만, 성석린은 혼자 돌아온다.
1402년 조사의의 난이 발생한다.
1402년 12월 태조가 환궁한다.

차사와 이성계의 반응
성석린, 무학대사가 환궁에 큰 역할을 했고, 태종 2년 11월 3일 환관 김완(金完)을 보내 문안케 하였다. 같은 달 7일에 예문관 대제학 이직(李稷)을 보내 문안케 하고, 청원군 심종(沈淙)과 예문관 제학 유창(劉敞)을 보내 시위하게 하였다(이들 가운데 태조 이성계에게 죽은 사람은 없다).
뒤에 태조는 시위 이자분(李自芬)을 태종에게 보내 제사에 쓸 물건을 빨리 보내라고 말했다고 한다. 죽이고 싶도록 미운 사람에게 제사에 쓸 신성한 물건을 요구할까?
또한 태종 2년 12월에 평양에서 머무를 때 시자에게 “내가 동북면에 있을 때에 국왕(태종)이 사람을 보내지 않았고, 맹주(孟州 평안남도 맹산군)에 있을 때도 사람을 보내지 않았으니 감정이 없지 않으리라.”라고 말하자, 시자가 “주상께서 안평 부원군 이서와 승려 익륜과 설오를 보냈으나 중간에 길이 막혀서 돌아갔습니다”라고 변명한다.
차사를 죽이기는커녕 보내지 않아 섭섭하다고 말하고 있다.
《태종실록》에서는 이성계가 성석린의 요청을 받아들여 태종 1년(1401년) 4월에 환궁하였다고 기록하고 있다. 그러나 그해 11월에 다시 한양을 떠나자, 다음해 1월 다시 성석린을 보내어 환궁을 요청한다.
이때 태조는 부처를 모시기 위해 돌아갈 수 없다고 거절하자 종친과 함께 환궁을 요청하던 성석린은 “염불하고 불경을 읽는 일이 어찌 꼭 소요산(消遙山)이라야만 하겠습니까?”라고 따지자, 이에 태조가 “그대들의 뜻은 이미 알고 있으나 내가 부처를 좋아하는 것은 다만 두 아들과 한 사람의 사위를 위함이다.”
라고 본심을 밝힌다. 두 아들이란 두말할 것도 없이 방원에게 죽은 방번과 방석을 말하고, 한 사람의 사위란 역시 방원에게 죽은 경순공주의 부마 이제(李濟)이다.
성석린은 그대로 빈손으로 돌아가 태종에게 “태상왕께서 빨리 돌아오실지, 늦게 돌아오실지는 아직 모르겠습니다.”라고 보고한다. 이후에도 성석린은 두 차례나 차사로 태조에게 갔으나 살아 돌아왔다.

무학대사와 함흥차사
태종 1년(1401) 11월 이성계가 다시 함흥으로 돌아가자 태종이 차사로 보낸 인물은 왕사 무학대사이다. 이에 대해서는 《태종실록》과 《오산설림》의 기록이 일치하며, 《오산설림》에 따르면 다음과 같다.
무학이 함흥에 가서 태조를 알현하니 태조가 “그대도 나를 달래러 왔구나”라고 말했다. 무학이 웃으면서, “전하께서 빈도와 서로 안 지가 수십 년인데 제 마음을 모르십니까? 저는 특별히 전하를 위로하기 위해 왔을 뿐입니다.”라고 대답했다. 무학이 그 뒤로 함흥 본궁에 머물면서 태조와 환담하는데 태종의 단점만 말하였고, 이에 태조가 그를 믿게 되었다. 수십일 뒤에 무학이 밤중에 태조에게 청하자 태조가 환궁하겠다고 말한다. 그러나 태조가 소요산에 머물면서 돌아오지 않자, 태종이 성석린을 그곳에 보내었다.

조사의의 난과 환궁
태조는 이후에도 한참이 지난 뒤 함경도에서 일어난 조사의의 난이 평정된 이후 한양으로 돌아온다. 당시 조사의의 난이 발생하여 조정으로부터 박순(朴淳), 송류(宋琉) 등이 차사로 파견되어 반군을 회유하였으나 도리어 죽음을 당하였다. 초기에는 반군이 우세하여 관군의 선봉 이천우(李天佑)를 격파하였으나 《태종실록》 2년(1402) 11월 27일 기사를 보면 조정에서도 대규모의 정벌군이 파견되었다. 그 후 중앙에서 증원된  출정군이 관군과 합류하여 군을 재정비하고 조사의의 난을 진압하고 함흥에 칩거하고 있던 태조를 시위하고 왔다. 《태종실록》2년(1402) 12월 8일 3번째기사를 보면 12월 8일에 태조가 한양에 환도를 하고 바로 다음날 태상왕을 시위하여 왔다고 정벌군으로 출정했던 이천우와 이빈에게 안마를, 이성도 절제사(泥城道節制使)였던 최운해에게 말을 하사했다는 기록이 보인다.

야사속 함흥차사
성석린과 함흥차사
태종이 태조에게 보낸 성석린의 이야기가 《명신록》에 실려 있다.
태종 이방원이 함흥차사로 자원한 성석린을 보내 아버지인 태조를 모셔오게 한다. 성석린이 밥을 짓는 시늉을 하였더니 태조가 오랜 지기인 그를 초대하였다. 성석린이 밤중에 부자 사이의 변고를 처리하는 도리를 말하자 태조는 “너도 너의 임금을 위해서 나를 달래려고 온 것이냐?”라고 의심하자 성석린은 “만약 그래서 왔다면 신(臣)의 자손은 반드시 눈이 멀어 장님이 될 것입니다”라고 대답했다. 이 말을 믿고 태조가 한양으로 돌아왔다.
《명신록》에 따르면, 뒷날 성석린의 맏아들 지도(至道)와 지도의 아들 귀수(龜壽)와 귀수의 아들이 모두 생모의 뱃속에서 배냇병신으로 눈이 멀었다. 석린의 작은 아들 발도(發道)는 후사가 없었다고 한다.

박순과 함흥차사
야담 수필집 《노봉집시장》(老峰集諡狀)에 함흥차사 이야기가 전해 오는데, 그때 함흥차사가 박순이다. 가는 사람마다 죽고 돌아오지 못하니 태종이 여러 신하들에게 “다음에는 누가 가겠는가?”라고 물으니 아무도 응하는 신하가 없었으나, 판승추부사(判承樞府事)인 박순이 자원하였다.
박순은 새끼 딸린 어미 말을 함흥까지 끌고 가서 “어미를 따르는 말도 저러한데 하물며 인간의 부모에 대한 정이야 얼마나 깊겠습니까?”라며 태조의 귀경을 설득했다. 며칠을 묵으며, 하루는 태조와 박순이 장기를 두는데 천장에서 쥐가 새끼를 안고 떨어져 죽을 지경이 되었으나 서로 떨어지지 않았다. 이에 박순이 장기판을 제쳐놓고 눈물을 흘리며 돌아가자고 청하니 태조가 돌아가기로 결심했다고 한다.
그러나 주변 사람이 박순을 죽여야 한다고 태조에게 고하자, 태조는 이미 박순이 용흥강을 건넜으리라 여기어 “용흥강을 건넜다면 쫓지 말라”라고 명령했는데, 안타깝게도 그는 병이 나서 쉬다가 용흥강을 건널 때, 쫓아 온 병사에 의해 죽음을 맞았다.
이 이야기는 어디까지나 야사일 뿐 사실은 아니며, 실제로 박순은 조사의의 난 때 함흥에서 도순문사 박만(朴蔓)을 설득하다가 죽임을 당한다.

태조, 태종에게 활을 쏘다
태조가 함흥에서 돌아올 때에도 여러 야사에서 두 사람의 갈등을 이야기한다.
태종이 직접 교외로 나가서 태조를 맞이하려 하자, 하륜 등이 말리면서, 태조의 진노가 아직 다 풀어지지 않았으니 모든 일을 염려하지 않을 수 없다고 말하여 큰 장막을 받치는 굵고 높은 기둥을 많이 세우게 하라고 조언하였다. 태종은 그렇게 하라 일렀다. 그 결과 태조가 태종을 보고 별안간 활을 쏘자, 태종은 급히 순간적으로 기둥 뒤에 몸을 피해 화살은 기둥에 꽂혔다. 이에 태조가 “모두 하늘의 뜻이로다”라고 탄식하며, 태종에게 옥새를 건네었다. 또 태종이 태조에게 잔을 올리는데, 역시 하륜이 일러준 대로 직접 잔을 따라 올리지 않고, 중간의 내시에게 잔을 바치게 하자 태조가 소매 속에서 철퇴를 꺼내 놓으면서 “모두 하늘의 뜻이로다”라고 말했다.
야사에서는 이 장소가 한양의 살곶이다리 근처라고 말하고 있으나, 《태종실록》에 따르면 이날은 태종2년 12월 8일이며, 장소는 황해도 금천의 금교역(金郊驛)이었다. 또한 위와 같은 살기등등한 장면은 보이지 않았으리라 추측하고 있다.

논란
호동왕자와 낙랑공주가 진심으로 사랑하지 않았다는 논란이 있다.대무신왕이 일부러 낙랑공주를 며느리로 맞이하고 뿔나팔과 자명고를 부서뜨리게 했다는 이야기도 있다. 몇몇 역사학자들도 대무신왕이 영토 확장의 욕심이 있었으니 그럴 가능성이 없지는 않다고 했다.

내용
어느날 옥저로 유람을 나섰던 호동왕자는 낙랑의 왕 최리와 마주쳤다. 최리는 호동왕자의 비범한 풍모를 알아보고 궁궐로 초대했다. 호동왕자는 궁궐에서 낙랑공주를 보았다. 둘은 서로 한눈에 반하였다. 그래서 둘은 사랑하는 사이가 되었다. 호동 왕자는 낙랑공주를 아내로 맞이하였고 꿈 같은 나날을 보냈다. 그러나 호동은 자신의 나라인 고구려로 떠나야 했다. 물론 낙랑공주와 함께 떠나야 했지만 아버지 대무신왕의 허락도 없이 혼인하였기 때문에 그럴수도 없는 일이었다. 그래서 호동 왕자는 ""내가 다시 와서 당신을 꼭 데려가리라."" 라고 말하고 고구려로 떠나고 말았다.        고구려로 돌아온 호동 왕자는 그동안의 일을 대무신왕에게 아뢰었다. 하지만 대무신왕은 허락하지 않았고 꼭 데려와야 하면 낙랑을 멸망시키고 데려오라고 하였다. 그 말에 호동 왕자는 가슴이 철렁 내려앉는 기분이 들었다. 여러 궁리 끝에 호동왕자는 낙랑공주에게 이 사실을 알렸고, 공주는 몰래 낙랑의 보물인 자명고 와 뿔나팔을 부숴뜨렸다. 낙랑공주에게 소식을 전해들은 호동왕자는 대무신왕에게 소식을 알려  총공격 명령을 받고 낙랑을 공격했다. 한편 낙랑의 궁전은 발칵 뒤집혔다. 한 신하가 적군이 쳐들어온다고 했지만 낙랑 왕은 믿지 않았다. 낙랑 왕은 뒤늦게 적이 쳐들어 왔을 때 알아차리고 말았다. 낙랑 왕이 무기고로 가보았을 때는 이미 자명고와 뿔 나팔이 찢어져 있고 부서져 있었다. 낙랑 왕이 낙랑공주가 부숴뜨린 걸 보고 낙랑공주의 목을 베었다. 낙랑 왕은 공주를 죽인 후 고구려에게 항복하고 말았다. 호동은 훗날 태자다툼에서 패하여 자살을 하였다고 한다.",韩国,N/A,2025-04-02 11:20:27

등장 인물
흥부
남보다 열심히 살기 위해 노력하지만 당시 사회적 모순으로 희생되는 인물이다. 그러나 박을 통해 값이 비싼 물건들을 얻어 부자가 되어 다른 기민들에게 나눠주는 공동체적 삶의 정신의 소유자이다.

놀부
사악한 심성을 가지고 있고 동생 흥부 일가를 집에서 쫓아낸다. 재물이 뒷받침되어 윤리 규범을 깨뜨려 나가며 사회적 모순을 심화시키는 인물이다. 후에 탐욕으로 인해 패망하지만 흥부의 도움 덕분에 살 수 있게 된다.

제비
월동하기 위해 중국 강남으로 매년 겨울 날아가는 철새로, 흥부가 제비 새끼의 다리를 치료해 준 이듬해 춘삼월 어느날, 박씨(보은박) 하나를 물고 흥부의 집으로 돌아와 은혜를 갚는다. 당대 민중의 삶의 이치인 ""권선징악""을 형상화시켜 주는 소재이다.

놀부의 처
흥부가 밥을 구걸하러 왔을 때, 밥풀이 묻은 주걱으로 흥부의 뺨을 치는 등 놀부 못지 않게 흥부를 괴롭힌다.

주제
소설 <흥부전(興夫傳)>은 일반적으로 형제간의 우애를 강조한 조선 사회의 유교적 세계관을 보여주며 인과응보에 따른 권선징악이라는 주제를 담고 있다고 알려져 있다. 착한 흥부가 제비를 만나 다리를 고쳐주고 박을 얻어 부자가 되자 놀부는 이를 시기하고 질투하여 흥부와 똑같이 행동하지만 되려 벌을 받고 착해지며 사이좋게 지냈다는 줄거리는 인과응보에 따른 권선징악과 형제애를 강조한 <흥부전(興夫傳)>의 주제를 알 수 있는 대목이다. 그러나 작품의 배경이 된 당시 조선 후기 사회는 신흥 계급이 등장하면서 유교적 질서의 근간이 흔들리고 있는 때였다. 당대의 사회상을 생각하면 흥부는 무능하고 몰락한 양반으로, 놀부는 탐욕스러운 신흥 상인 계급의 모습을 투영한다고 볼 수 있다. 따라서 <흥부전(興夫傳)>, 그 이면의 주제는 몰락한 양반과 물질만을 중요하게 생각하는 탐욕스러운 신흥 상인 계급을 풍자하며 비판하고 있는 것이라 할 수 있다. 또한, 당시 작품을 생성하고 향유했던 서민계층의 생가을 반영한 것으로 급변하는 현실 사회에서 몰락한 양반의 모습을 보여주며, 양반으로서 위세를 부리려하는 기존의 유교적 관념을 비판한다. <흥부전(興夫傳)>은 당시 유교적 세계관에 새로운 서민만의 세계관을 드러냈다는 점에서 가치있다고 평가받는다. 또한 표면적인 주제는 중세의 가치관에 해당하는 형제간의 우애나 권선징악이지만, 이면적으로는 조선 후기의 현실을 비판적으로 바라보며 근대적 가치관에 해당하는 빈부의 갈등을 주제로 삼았다

전해오는 이야기
전라북도 남원시 인월면 성산리는 흥부가 태어난 곳으로, 아영면 성리는 흥부가 정착하고 부자가 된 곳으로 보는 견해가 있다. 주민들은 양 지역에는 흥부전과 관련된 지명이 남아 있고, 흥부전의 원형 격인 ‘박 첨지 설화’와 ‘춘보 설화’가 각각 전해지며, 옛 이름이 각각 ‘성현동, 복덕촌, 성복골’과 ‘복성리’였다는 점을 근거로 든다. 아영면 성리에서는 1991년에 흥부전의 얼개와 유사하게 서술된 천석꾼 임씨의 약력이 새겨진 비석이 발견된 적도 있다. 반면 2017년에 발굴된 흥부전의 가장 오래된 이본인 《흥보만보록》에는 공간적 배경이 평양 서촌(현 평양직할시 순안구역)으로 되어 있다.

생애
어린 시절
948년 12월 22일(음력 11월 19일)에 삼한벽상공신(三韓壁上功臣) 강궁진의 아들로 금주(지금의 서울특별시 관악구 낙성대 근처)에서 태어났다. 5대조인 강여청(姜餘淸)이 시흥군(始興郡)으로 이주하여 금주(衿州)의 호족이 되었다. 어릴적 이름은 은천(殷川)이었다.

장원 급제
983년(성종 3년) 과거에 장원으로 급제하여 예부시랑(禮部侍郞)이 되었다.

거란의 2차 습격
1010년(현종 1년) 요나라 성종이 강조의 정변을 표면상의 구실로 내세워 40만 군으로 서경(西京)을 침공하였다. 현종은 강조를 행영도통사(行營都統使)로 삼아 30만 군을 거느리고 통주(通州)에 나가 막게 했으나 크게 패배했다. 강감찬은 요나라에 항복하자는 다른 중신들에 반대하며 전략상 일시 후퇴할 것을 주장하여 나주로 피난하여 사직을 보호하였다. 하공진(河拱辰)이 적을 설득하자 요나라군은 고려에서 물러갔다. 요나라 군이 돌아가던 중 양규(楊規)가 고려에서 물러가는 요군을 뒤에서 쳐 고려는 큰 승리를 거두고 요는 많은 피해를 입고 물러갔다.
1011년 국자제주(國子祭酒)가 되고, 한림학사·승지·좌산기상시(左散騎常侍)·중추원사(中樞院使)·이부상서 등을 역임했다.

거란의 3차 습격
1018년(현종 9) 요나라는 고려 현종이 친히 입조하지 않은 것과 강동 6주를 돌려주지 않은 것을 구실로 삼아 소배압(蕭排押)이 이끄는 10만 대군으로 고려를 침략했다.
이때 서경유수 내사시랑 평장사로 있던 강감찬은 상원수가 되어 원수 강민첨(姜民瞻) 등과 함께 20만 8천 명을 이끌고 나가 곳곳에서 요나라군을 격파했다. 흥화진(興化鎭) 전투에서는 1만 2천여 명의 기병을 산골짜기에 매복시키고, 굵은 밧줄로 쇠가죽을 꿰어 성 동쪽의 냇물을 막았다가 적병이 이르자 막았던 물을 일시에 내려보내는 전술로 혼란에 빠진 요나라군을 크게 무찔렀다.
이어 자주(慈州)와 신은현(新恩縣)에서 고려군의 협공으로 패퇴하는 요나라군을 추격하여 귀주(龜州)에서 적을 섬멸했는데, 이 전투를 귀주대첩이라 한다. 요나라군 10만 명 중에서 생존자는 겨우 수천에 불과하였다. 강감찬이 승리를 거두고 수많은 포로와 전리품을 거두어 돌아오자 현종은 직접 영파역(迎波驛)까지 마중을 나와 금화팔지(金花八枝: 금으로 만든 꽃 여덟 송이)를 머리에 꽂아 주고 오색비단으로 천막을 쳐서 전승을 축하하는 연회를 벌였다.
귀주대첩의 승리로 요나라는 침략 야욕을 포기하게 되었고, 고려와 요나라 사이의 평화적 국교가 성립되었다. 고려는 송나라와 정식 외교 관계는 단절하였지만, 무역 및 문화 교류는 계속 이루어졌고, 요나라도 송으로부터 조공을 받는 수준에서 송과도 긴장된 평화 관계를 유지하게 되었다.

전쟁 이후
전란이 수습된 뒤 1019년에 검교태위 문하시랑 동내사문하평장사 천수현개국남(檢校太尉 門下侍郎 同內史門下平章事 天水縣開國男)에 봉해지고 식읍 3백 호를 받았으며, 추충협모안국공신(推忠協謀安國功臣)의 호를 받았다.
1020년에는 특진검교태부 천수현개국남(特進檢校太傅 天水縣開國子)에 식읍 3백호가 되었다. 1030년에 문하시중에 올랐고 1031년(현종 22년)에 특진 검교태사 시중 천수군개국후(特進檢校太師侍中天水郡開國侯에 이르렀다.
1031년에 향년 84세의 나이로 졸하였다.

사후
사후 현종의 묘정(廟庭)에 배향되었다. 시호는 인헌(仁憲)이다.이성계 때 수태사 겸 중서령(守太師兼中書令)에 추증되었다. 
충청북도 청주시 옥산면 국사리에서 묘지석을 발굴해 1968년 충현사가 건립되었다.

평가
재상으로 있을 때 송나라에서 온 사신이 강감찬을 보고 저도 모르게 절을 올리며 ""문곡성(文曲星)이 오랫동안 보이지 않더니 바로 여기에 있었구려!""라고 말했다. 
고려사에 따르면 강감찬은 성품이 청렴하고 검약하여 집안 살림을 돌보지 않았다. 체구가 작고 외모가 못생겼으며 의복은 더럽고 해어져서 보통 사람과 다를 바가 없었다. 그러나 엄숙한 얼굴로 조정에 서서 국가대사가 생길 때마다 정책을 결정지으며 나라의 우뚝한 기둥이자 초석 역할을 하였다. 당시 풍년이 들고 백성이 편안하며 나라 안팎이 무사하자, 사람들은 그 모두가 강감찬의 공이라고 생각했다고 한다.

660년 백제와의 전쟁에서 큰 공을 세우고 계백의 진영에 세 번 찾아가 결투를 벌이던 중 전사했다. 그의 죽음은 신라군이 결사적으로 백제와 싸우는데 기여하였다. 그 후에 그는 신라의 대표적인 화랑으로 알려져 노래〈한국을 빛낸 100명의 위인들〉에 그가 나오기도 한다.

생애
관창은 645년 신라의 좌장군 품일의 아들로 태어났다. 그는 15세 때 이미 말 탄 채 활 쏘는 데 능하여 김춘추에게 천거되었고, 660년 신라가 당나라와 합세하여 백제를 공격할 때 부장(副將)이 되었다.
황산벌에서 신라군과 백제군 사이에 대격전이 벌어졌는데, 이 싸움 중 신라군이 4번 싸워 4번 지자 다섯 번째 싸움 때 관창은 선봉에 서서 적군 속에 들어가서 싸우다가 백제의 포로가 되었다. 백제 장수 계백은 그 어린 소년의 용맹에 감탄하여 죽이지 않고 용맹을 칭송한 뒤 신라군에게로 되돌려 보냈다. 그러나 관창은 부끄러워하며 우물물 한 모금 마시고 적진에 다시 돌입하여 용감하게 싸우다가 다시  힘이 빠져 포로가 되었다. 계백은 다시 관창을 풀어주었다. 그러나 얼마 뒤 관창이 다시 말을 타고 계백의 진영으로 돌격해 왔다. 계백은 그의 목을 베고 수급을 말 안장에 매달아 신라군 진지로 돌려보냈다. 
이것을 본 신라군은 5번째 싸움에서 백제 결사군을 전멸시켰다.

평가
사후 관창 역시 무속의 신의 한사람으로 숭배되었으며, 사당은 주로 충청남도 논산과 연산 지역에 분포되었다. 대한민국에 와서는 〈한국을 빛낸 100명의 위인들〉(박문영 작곡·작사)에 나오기도 했고, 1970년대에는 애국자의 한사람으로 칭송되었다.

생애
탄생과 가계
374년(소수림왕 4년), 당시 국왕이었던 소수림왕의 동생인 왕자 이련(伊連, 고국양왕)의 아들로 태어났다. 

 
아! 옛날 시조 추모왕(동명성왕)이 나라를 세우셨다.
왕은 북부여에서 나셨으며, 천제의 아들이고 어머니는 하백의 따님이시다.
(중략)
17세손에 이르러 국강상 광개토경 평안호태왕(國𦊆上廣開土境平安好太王)이
18세에 왕위에 올라 영락태왕(永樂太王)이라 칭하였다.

시조 동명성왕의 17세손이라고 기록되어 있는데, 이 '세손'을 1) 왕대수 또는 2) 혈연상 세대수로 보는 설이 있다.
384년에 큰아버지인 소수림왕이 후사 없이 사망하자 아버지 고국양왕이 뒤를 이어 즉위하였으며, 386년 1월, 태자로 책봉되었다.
391년 광개토왕이 고국양왕의 뒤를 이어 즉위하였다. 즉위 년도와 관련하여 《삼국사기》에는 392년에 즉위한 것으로 기록되어 있어 광개토대왕릉비의 기록과는 약 1년의 차이를 보이고 있다. 연호는 영락(永樂)이다.

백제와의 전쟁
광개토대왕은 392년 7월에 군사 40,000명을 거느리고 백제의 북쪽 변경을 공격해서 석현성 등 10여 개 성을 함락시켰다. 진사왕은 광개토대왕이 군사를 부리는 데 능하다는 말을 듣고 나가 막지 못하니 한강(漢水) 북쪽의 여러 부락들이 다수 함락되었다. 8월에 백제가 고구려의 남쪽 변경을 공격해 오자, 장수에게 명하여 막게 하였다. 승기를 탄 고구려는 10월에 백제 북방의 천혜의 요새이자 중요지인 관미성을 20일에 걸친 포위 끝에 쳐서 함락시켰다. 
이 해 12월 백제 진사왕이 구원에서 사망하고 아신왕이 즉위하였다. 백제는 빼앗긴 성을 회복하기 위해 계속해서 고구려를 공격하였다. 393년 8월에 아신왕은 진무를 좌장으로 삼고 목책에 이르렀다. 그러나 치욕을 씻기 위한 도발이었기에 이내 회군하였다. 광개토대왕은 백제의 공격을 393년에는 관미성, 394년에는 수곡성(水谷城)에서 격퇴하였으며, 394년에 고구려는 백제의 침략을 방비하기 위해 남쪽 변경에 7개의 성을 쌓았다. 
395년에는 패수에서 백제군 8,000여 명을 생포하고 대승을 거두었다. 396년 고구려는 대대적으로 백제를 공격하여 한강 이북의 58개 성, 700여 개 촌락을 점령하고 위례성을 포위하였다. 이때 백제 아신왕에게서 '영원한 노객(奴客)이 되겠다.'는 항복을 받아 아신왕의 동생과 백제의 대신 10명을 인질로 잡고 개선하였다.(→고구려 백제 전쟁)

거란 및 숙신 정벌
백제와의 전쟁과 더불어, 거란을 정벌하여 소수림왕 8년(378년)에 거란의 침입으로 잡혀갔던 1만 여 명의 백성들을 되찾는다.(392년 9월)395년에는 염수(鹽水)로 진출하여 거란족 패려(稗麗)를 정벌하여 복속시키고 수없이 많은 소, 말, 양떼들을 노획하였다. 일부 학자들은 《삼국사기》의 거란 정벌(392년)과 광개토대왕릉비의 비려 정벌(395년)을 동일한 사건에 대한 기록으로 보기도 한다.
한편 398년에는 숙신을 정벌하여 동북 국경 지대를 안정시켰다.

신라 구원과 가야 진출 및 백제ㆍ가야ㆍ왜 연합군 격퇴
이후 백제가 왜(倭)에 태자 전지를 보내는 등 왜와 동맹을 맺고 고구려에 대적할 준비를 한다. 광개토대왕은 399년에 평양(平壤)으로 순행하였다. 백제와 왜가 신라를 공격하자, 신라는 평양으로 사신을 보내 구원을 청하였고, 이에 광개토대왕은 400년에 신라에 5만 대군을 파견하여 왜군을 물리쳤다. 이때 왜군은 금관가야 종발성까지 퇴각하였고, 고구려군은 금관가야 지역까지 쫓아가 왜군을 격퇴시킨다. 학계에서는 이때 금관가야의 세력이 급속도로 약해져, 금관가야가 주도하던 전기 가야 연맹이 붕괴하고 대가야가 주도하는 후기 가야 연맹이 시작되었다고 본다. 
광개토대왕은 400년에 신라를 구원하면서 신라 왕을 내물 마립간에서 실성 마립간으로 교체한다. 이후 고구려군은 백여 년 동안 신라 땅에 머물려 신라에 영향력을 행사하였고, 신라는 고구려에게 조공하는 보호국이 된다. 404년에는 대방(帶方) 지역으로 쳐들어 온 백제와 왜, 가야의 연합군을 궤멸시켰다.

후연과의 전쟁
한편 광개토대왕은 모용씨(慕容氏)의 후연과도 치열한 전쟁을 치렀다. 400년 2월에 고구려 주력군이 신라에서 왜군을 격퇴하고 있을 때 후연 왕 모용성은 신성(新城)과 남소성(南蘇城)을 공격해 오자, 광개토대왕은 이에 대한 보복전을 펼쳐 402년에 후연의 숙군성(宿軍城)을 공격하여 함락시켰으며 404년에도 후연을 정벌하였다. 비슷한 시기에 연군(燕郡)까지 공격하여 함락시켰다. 연군은 지금의 베이징 근방에 위치한 지역으로 이 기록에 따라 베이징 일대까지 정복했다는 주장이 있다. 
이를 회복하기 위해 쳐들어온 후연군을 405년 요동성, 406년 목저성(木抵城)에서 격파하여 요동 점령을 확고히 하였다. 또한 407년에는 50,000명을 동원하여 후연 군대를 격파하여 막대한 전리품을 노획하고 돌아오는 길에 후연의 6개 성을 점령하였다. 후연을 견제하기 위하여 남연(南燕)과 우호관계를 맺기도 하였다. 그러나 후연이 멸망하고 고구려계인 고운이 북연을 건국하자 408년에 우호관계를 맺음으로써 서쪽 국경을 안정시켰다.
410년에는 동부여(東夫餘)를 공격하여 굴복시켰다.

내치
광개토대왕은 내치에도 힘썼다. 평양을 크게 중시하여 393년에는 9개 절을 평양에 창건하고 399년에는 왕이 직접 평양에 행차하기도 하였다. 아마 백제ㆍ왜ㆍ가야를 처단하기 위한 목적일 것이다. 409년에는 나라 동쪽에 독산성 등 6개 성을 쌓고 평양의 민호를 옮겨 살게 하였으며 다시 남쪽으로 순행하였다. 또한 역대 왕릉의 정비에 힘써 수묘인(守墓人) 제도를 정비하고 실시할 것을 장수왕에게 유언하였다. 이러한 내치로 광개토대왕릉비에는 “나라가 부강하고 백성이 편안하였으며 오곡이 풍성하게 익었다”라 칭송하는 기록을 남기기도 하였다.

사망
《삼국사기》에는 413년 10월에 사망하였다고 기록되어 있으며, 〈광개토대왕릉비〉의 기년법으로 역산하면 412년이 되어 1년의 오차가 생긴다.
장수왕은 414년에 능비를 세우고 유언에 따라 수묘인을 두어 왕릉을 관리하게 하였다. 1880년에 발견된 광개토대왕릉비에는 광개토대왕의 활발한 정복 사업이 기록되어 있으며, 평생에 걸쳐 64개 성과 1,400촌을 공취했다고 전하고 있다. 그의 능과 생전의 훈적(勳績)을 기록한 능비(陵碑)가 414년에 건립되었는데, 지금도 중국 지린성 지안 현에 남아 있다. 능에 대해서는 장군총(將軍塚)설과 태왕릉(太王陵)설이 갈라져 있다.

생애
생애 초반
궁예의 출생을 두고 신라 왕족과 연관되어 있다는 주장이 있다. 《삼국사기》에 의하면 궁예는 신라의 국왕 헌안왕(김의정) 혹은 경문왕(김응렴)과 그의 빈어(嬪御) 사이에서 태어난 왕의 서자로 기록되어 있다. 음력 5월 5일에 외가에서 태어났으며, 태어날 때부터 무지개를 닮은 흰 빛이 지붕 위에 있었고 날 때부터 치아가 있었다. 당시 단오에 태어난 아이를 불길하게 여기던 문화와 궁예의 이런 특성을 두고 불길하게 여긴 일관이 아버지인 왕에게 궁예를 죽일 것을 청했는데 왕명으로 궁예를 죽이러 온 중사(中使)는 궁예를 포대기에 싸서 높은 누대에서 던졌다. 누대 아래로 떨어진 궁예를 유모가 밑에서 받아서 목숨은 구했지만 이때 유모의 손가락이 눈을 찌르는 바람에 한 쪽 눈을 실명했고 유모는 궁예와 함께 멀리 도망가 궁예를 길렀다고 한다. 이런 출생의 사연 때문인지 궁예는 평생 신라를 적대적으로 대한다.

삼국사기와 고려사에 등장하는 고경참문에 의하면 궁예는 丑년생인데 그러면 857년생, 혹은 869년생인 걸 알 수 있다. 궁예가 891년 절을 떠나 처음 봉기에 참여한 시기로 미루어 짐작할 때 869년생, 그러니까 경문왕의 서자라는 설이 더 설득력 있게 받아들여진다.
한편 '태봉의 궁예정권'을 쓴 조인성과 다른 소장 학자들은 고려왕조 건국 정당화를 위해서 신라 왕자가 아닌 궁예를 신라 왕의 아들로 조작했다는 설을 주장하고 있다. 즉 신라 왕의 아들이면서도 자신의 조국인 신라를 철저히 적대시하는 패륜아로 조작해 고려왕조 건국 정당화를 꾀했다는 의견이다. 이 의견을 처음 꺼낸 단재 신채호는 궁예를 고구려 유민 계열의 평범한 승려 출신으로 보았고 현대의 조인성 같은 학자들은 궁예는 몰락한 신라 진골 귀족 출신으로 추정하는 의견이 많다.
궁예가 10여 세가 되었을 무렵 유모는 말썽만 일으키고 있는 궁예에게 출생의 비밀을 알리며 ""너는 왕자로서 태어났고 살해당하는 것이 안 되게 생각되어너를 목숨을 걸고 길렀는데 너는 매일 소동을 일으켜 나에게 걱정만 끼치고 있다. 너의 정체가 알려지면 우리는 살해당할 것이니 슬프다.""라고 했다. 궁예는 울면서 ""그러면 제가 집을 나가서 더 이상 어머님에게 걱정을 끼치지 않겠습니다..."" 하고는 집을 나와서 세달사(世達寺)에 몸을 기탁해 스스로 성명을 선종(善宗)이라 했다.
궁예의 승려 시절에 대해 《삼국사기》는 그가 ""장성하자 승려의 계율에 얽매이지 않고 기상이 활발하며 뱃심이 있었다.""고 전한다. 이후 기훤의 부하나 양길 같은 군벌들에게 빠르게 인정받는 상황을 보면 승려 활동보다는 무예 등에 더 관심이 있었던 것으로 추정된다. 훗날 궁예의 측근으로 같이 축출된 종간이라는 인물에 대해 ""젊어서 승려가 되었던 자""라고 적었기 때문에 일찍부터 궁예와 관계가 있었을 것으로 보이는 종간이 궁예의 승려 시절, 즉 세달사에 있던 시절에 궁예를 알게 되었을 것으로 보기도 한다. 세달사에서 승려로 지내던 궁예가 어느 날 재(齋)에 나아가 행렬에 들었는데 까마귀가 그의 바리때에 '왕(王)' 자가 새겨진 상앗대를 떨어뜨리고 간 것을 보게 되었고 이때부터 궁예는 자신이 장차 크게 떨쳐 일어날 것이라 굳게 믿었다고 한다.

출사
진성여왕 때부터 신라의 각지에서는 거듭되는 흉년과 가혹한 세금 징수를 견디다 못해 도망쳐 도적이 된 자들의 봉기가 잇따랐는데 진성여왕 5년(891년) 궁예도 절을 떠나서 죽주(竹州-경기도 안성시)에서 활동하던 군벌 기훤(箕萱)을 찾아가 그의 휘하에 들어가려 했다. 그러나 기훤이 궁예에게 오만하고 무례한 자세로 대하자 궁예는 다음해인 진성여왕 6년(892년) 기훤의 휘하에 있던 원회(元會), 신훤(申煊)과 같이 기훤 세력을 떠나 북원(北原-강원도 원주시)의 군벌 양길(梁吉)의 휘하에 들어갔다. 양길은 궁예를 신임해 그에게 군사를 나누어 주며 북원 동쪽 땅의 경략을 맡겼고 궁예의 군대는 치악산의 석남사(石南寺)에 주둔하면서 북원 동쪽의 주천(酒泉-강원도 원주시) · 내성(奈城-강원도 영월군) · 울오(鬱烏) 어진(御珍) 빠르게 점령한다.
진성여왕 8년(894년)에는 드디어 명주를 다스리던 김순식에게 항복을 받아네 명주(溟州-강원도 강릉시) 무혈 입성했다. 이 때 궁예의 세력이 강해지자 궁예는 자신의 부대 3,500명을(신라본기에는 600명), 재편성해 14대(隊)로 나누어 편재하고 김대(金大) · 검모(黔毛) · 흔장(昕長) · 귀평(貴平) · 장일(張一) 등을 뽑아 사상(舍上-부장)으로서 임명하고 궁예 자신은 장군(將軍)을 자칭했는데 하대 신라에서 반란의 지도자나 호족 세력이 장군을 자칭한 것은 궁예가 최초였다. 궁예는 자신을 따르는 무리들과 고락을 함께 하며 일을 공명정대하게 처리해 신라에 등을 돌린 백성들의 마음을 끌어들이는 데 성공한다.

당시 '명주'의 성주는 김순식으로 그의 조상은 신라 무열왕의 직계 자손이었다. 신라가 쇠퇴기에 접어들기 시작했던 36대 혜공왕보다 겨우 2명 뒤의 임금으로 신라 38대 왕이 되는 원성왕(재위 기간: 785년 ~798년)서 패한 뒤 화가 자신에게 미칠 것을 두려워해 이곳 '명주'땅으로 내려와 지배하면서 '명주군왕'(溟州郡王)을 자처한 김주원이 선조로 그가 명주를 지배한 후 후손인 '김순식' 때까지 100년이 넘게 지배적인 권력을 누리고 있었다. 그리고 김주원 이후 그의 아들 김헌창(金憲昌)이 '내전' 규모의 대규모 반란을 일으켰다가 토벌되었고, '김헌창'의 아들인 '김범문'도 반란을 일으키다가 실패했는데도 불구하고 김주원의 자손들은 '명주'를 100년이 넘게 통치하고 있었다. 아무리 나말의 신라 중앙정부가 내부의 극심한 권력다툼과 부패, 수탈로 엉망이었다고는 해도 김주원의 아들인 '김헌창'이 대규모 반란을 일으키다가 진압이 되고 그 뒤 김헌창의 아들인 '김범문'도 다시 반란을 일으켜 2대가 토벌이 될 정도여서 마냥 무능력하지만은 않은 신라중앙정부군에게 '명주'만은 끝내 멸망당하지 않았고, 100년이 훨씬 넘게 명주에서 사실상 임금 행세를 할 수 있었던 '김주원'과 그 후손들은 믿기 힘들 정도로 강한 저항력을 가졌다. 훗날 918년 왕건의 역성혁명으로 궁예가 몰락하고 고려가 건국되었는데도 불구하고 김순식은 무려 10년을 고려 태조 왕건에게 항복하지 않고 버티다가 928년 1월에 가서야 완전히 투항을 하는, 믿기 힘들 정도의 초인적인 저항능력을 보여준 것을 감안하면 당시 궁예가 나라도 건국하지 못한 상태에서 이렇게 막강한 '김순식'이 지배하는 명주를 함락시키는 것은 불가능에 가까웠다. 일각에선 김순식이 기득권을 보장받는 대신 명주를 궁예에게 바쳤을 것이라고 추정하고 있지만, 또 추가로 궁예와 김순식이 개인적으로 밀접했기 때문이라는 말도 있다. 그래서 둘의 인간관계가 친한 점에 더해 명주의 기득권을 보장받는 조건으로 김순식이 궁예에게 항복한 것으로 볼 수 있다.
일부는 궁예가 이 때부터 세상이 끝나는 날 현신해 세상을 구원한다는 미륵불이라 자처했고 백성들은 그런 궁예를 자신들을 구원해줄 대상으로 삼았지만 궁예가 이때부터 자신을 미륵으로 여겼다는 학계 일부의 견해는 설득력이 떨어진다. 왜냐하면 이때의 궁예는 아직 양길의 부하로 있었던 시절이었고 명주를 장악한 후 황제나 왕도 아닌 장군만 자처하는 상황에서 스스로 미륵으로 자처하며 사람들에게 자신이 신이라고 말하는 것은 논리적으로 앞뒤가 안 맞는 상황이기 때문이다.

즉위와 전쟁
태봉(후고구려) 개국 선포
진성여왕 9년(895년), 궁예는 동해를 끼고 북상해 영서 지방으로 넘어와 저족, 성주(화천), 부약(금화), 금성(금화군), 철원 등 10여 군현을 점령하여 세력 기반을 다졌고, 지금의 강원도 전 지역을 장악한 궁예는 이듬해 철원을 자신의 도읍으로 삼았다. 궁예의 세력이 급성장하자 패서(浿西), 즉 예성강 이북 지역의 호족들이 차례로 궁예에게 자진 투항했는데, 세력이 강력해진 것을 본 궁예는 나라를 세워 임금이 된다.
진성여왕 10년(896년) 송악(松嶽-경기도 개성시)의 해상 호족이었던 사찬 왕륭이 송악군을 바치고 항복한다. 이에 궁예는 왕륭을 금성태수에 임명하고 한편 왕륭의 건의를 받아들여 왕륭의 아들인 왕건을 송악군에 발어참성(勃禦塹城)을 쌓게 한 뒤 그곳의 성주로 임명한다 혹은 왕건을 철원군태수에 임명했다는 기록도 있다 그 뒤로도 세력을 빠르게 확장하는 한편 진성여왕 11년(897년) 왕륭의 제의를 받아들인 궁예는 898년 7월 철원에서 송악으로 도읍을 옮기고, 왕건을 시켜 양주와 청주(淸州) 등 30여 성을 정벌하도록 했다. 겨울 11월에 궁예는 처음으로 팔관회를 열었다.
효공왕 3년(899년) 궁예는 청주 지방을 점령하여 소백산맥 이북의 한강 유역을 수중에 넣고, 3월에 왕건을 정기대감(精騎大監)으로 삼아 양주와 견주를 공략하게 했지만 이겼다는 표현이나 함락,평정 등의 승리를 뜻하는 용어들이 없는 관계로 왕건의 이 첫번째 전투는 실패했을 가능성이 높다. 궁예의 세력이 강성해지는 것에 두려움을 느낀 북원의 양길은 자신의 관할 및 한산주 지역 호족들을 끌어들여 궁예를 공격하지만 이를 사전에 간파한 궁예의 선제 공격으로 비뇌성 전투에서 참패하고 자신도 몰락하고 말았고, 비뇌성에서 양길을 패배시킨 뒤인 효공왕 4년(900년) 왕건에게 명하여 광주 · 국원경(충주) · 청주 · 당성(唐城) · 괴양(槐壤) 일대를 정벌하여 광주를 우선 평정하고, 국원경과 청주 · 괴양의 적수 청길(淸吉) · 신훤(莘萱) 등의 항복을 받아냈다. 그리고 효공왕 5년(901년) 7월에 스스로 고려왕(후고구려왕)을 칭했다(《삼국유사》 연표에는 고려). 김부식은 《삼국사기》에서 ""신라가 당병을 청해 고구려를 멸망시켜서 평양의 옛 도읍에는 잡초만 무성하게 되었으니, 그 원수를 내가 갚겠다""고 선언한 궁예의 발언을 기록하면서, 그것을 ""신라로부터 버림받은 것에 분을 품었기 때문""이라고 소개했고, 궁예가 부석사에서 신라왕의 초상화를 발견하고 그것을 칼로 쳤다는 일화도 함께 전하고 있다.
효공왕 6년(902년)부터 왕건을 서해안에 파견해 당시 후백제의 해상으로의 대중 교역로를 차단하게 했고, 효공왕 7년(903년) 3월, 수군으로 후백제의 후방에 위치한 중요한 해상 거점이었던 금성(錦城. 지금의 나주 지역)지역을 점령하면서 영토를 넓혔다. 나아가 왕건은 금성 공략과 함께 양주(良州)의 호족이었던 김인훈(金忍訓)을 구하여 돌아온 공으로 궁예로부터 알찬의 관등을 받았다.

마진
신라 효공왕 7년(904년) 7월에 궁예는 신라의 제도를 참작해 관직을 설치하고, 국호를 마진으로 고쳤으며 연호를 정하여 무태(武泰)라 했다.
이보다 앞선 903년부터 궁예는 수도를 이미 송악에서 자신의 첫 거점이었던 철원으로 옮길 계획을 세우고 있었다. 철원과 부양 등지를 친히 돌면서 산세를 살피기도 하고, 청주의 민호 1천여 호를 철원으로 옮겼으며, 이듬해인 무태 2년(905년)에 송악에서 철원으로 도읍을 옮겼다.
궁예가 철원으로 도읍한 뒤에 세운 궁터는 구 철원 북쪽 30리, 현재 비무장지대 안에 위치해 있으며, 그곳의 지명은 풍천원(楓川原)이라 불리는 곳이었다. 철원의 궁궐과 누대는 크고 화려하게 세워졌으며, 연호도 무태에서 성책(聖冊)으로 바뀌었다. 904년 상주와 근처의 30여 주현을 쳐서 빼았았고, 공주 장군 홍기(弘奇)가 와 투항했고, 또한 905년 평양성주 장군 검용(黔用)이 항복했고, 증성(甑城)의 적의(赤衣) · 황의(黃衣)의 도적 명귀(明貴) 등이 복속해 와 궁예는 지금까지의 모든 전투들에서 승리를 거두어 '상승장군' 모습을 유감없이 보여주었다. 《삼국사기》는 이때부터 궁예가 강성해졌다며 자만하고는 신라를 병탄하고자 했고, 신라를 멸도(滅都)라고 부르게 하면서 신라에서부터 귀순해 오는 자는 모두 죽였다고 적고 있다.
성책 2년(906년), 궁예는 왕건을 보내 견훤의 군대를 상주(尙州)의 사화진(沙火鎭)에서 맞아 싸우게 했고 왕건의 군대는 견훤의 군대와 여러차례 치열하게 싸워 결국 크게 이겼다.
한편 후백제의 견훤은 궁예 성책 5년(909년) 다시 나주 지역에 대한 공략을 실시하여 지금의 영산강 하에서 영광 서쪽 해안인 염해현까지 진격했다. 6월에 왕건의 수군이 광주(光州)의 진도(珍島)를 쳐서 차지하고 고이도(皐夷島)의 항복을 받아냈으며, 목포에서 덕진포까지 진을 치고 있던 후백제의 수군을 화공(火攻)으로 대파했으며, 압해현의 해상 호족 능창이 왕건의 수군에 붙잡혀 궁예에게 보내져 처형되었다. 성책 6년(910년) 후백제의 견훤이 다시 3천명의 군사를 내어 나주를 10일간 공격하자 부하 장군에게 수군을 주어 공격해 견훤을 쳐서 몰아내고 나주 지역을 확고하게 지배하게 되었고, 이후 912년 궁예는 왕건을 대동해 자신이 직접 군대를 이끌고 덕진포로 진출해 견훤과 싸워 견훤을 패배시키고 나주를 다시 되찾았다고 선각국사비(형미.)의 비석에 나오고, 오늘날 국사학계에서도 유력한 학설로 떠오르고 있다. 그밖에 궁예는 908년에도 직접 군대를 거느리고 나주로 출병해 공을 세웠다고 신라말,고려 초의 고승인 '사무외대사'중 한 명인(형미도 포함됨.)'경유' 대사의 비석에서도 나오듯이 최근에는 '나주 전투'에서의 궁예의 역할이 재조명되는 측면이 있다.

이 무렵 궁예의 판도는 남으로는 공주와 상주, 동북으로는 증성(甑城), 서북으로는 지금의 황해도와 평안남도 남부까지 이르러 국세를 크게 떨쳤다.

태봉
911년(효공왕 14년) : 국호를 태봉(泰封)으로, 연호를 수덕만세(水德萬歲)로 개칭하고 궁궐을 증축했다. 태봉(泰封)의 뜻은 주역에서 ‘태(泰)’는 ‘천지가 어울려 만물을 낳고 상하가 어울려 그 뜻이 같아진다’는 뜻이라 하고, 봉(封)은 봉토, 곧 땅이다. 결국 궁예는 철원을 기반으로 ‘영원한 평화가 깃든 평등 세계’, 곧 미륵세상인 대동방국의 기치를 높이 든 것이다.
《삼국사기》는 궁예가 태봉을 선포한 때부터 스스로를 현세의 미륵(彌勒)이라고 칭하게 되었다고 기록했다. 행차할 때면 금관을 머리에 쓰고 금은으로 장식한 말안장을 얹은 말에, 행차 앞뒤로 향로를 받쳐 든 남녀 어린아이 수십 명을 세워 걷게 했으며, 자신의 두 아들도 청광보살 · 신광보살이라 부르게 했다. 또한 직접 불교 경전 20권을 짓기도 했는데, 당시 석총(釋總)이라는 승려가 이 불경을 보고 ""하나같이 요사스러운 말로서 입에 담기도 어렵다""고 혹평했고, 이에 분노한 궁예는 석총을 철퇴로 쳐 죽이고 말았다.
이 외에도 917년에 선종 계열의 승려로, 후백제 지역에서 건너와 활동했던 형미도 궁예에게 죽임을 당했다고 전해져, 궁예가 억지스러운 불교 경전들을 짓고, 미륵으로 행세하는 식의, 정통 불교 교리를 근본적으로 파괴하는 억지스러운 자기 신격화를 추진하는 것에 대해 불교계가 거센 반발을 하고 있음을 알 수 있고, 또 유학자들의 경우도 본래 궁예의 최측근이였다가 궁예에게 죽을뻔한 왕건을 살려준 후, 궁예를 등지고 왕건의 최측근이 된 유학자 최응과 궁예 정권 시절 궁예의 태자인 청광보살의 사부의 벼슬이였던 동궁기실로 있다가 궁예의 왕비 강씨와 강씨의 두 아들이 처형된 전후에 궁을 탈출해 승려가 되었다가, 역시 왕건의 집권 후 돌아와 왕건의 신료가 되어 왕건에게 최초로 왕씨 성을 하사받은 왕유(본명: 박유)의 경우와 궁예가 몰락한 해인 918년 3월, 왕창근이 한 기이한 노인에게서 얻은 거울에 적힌 왕건이 궁예를 멸망시킨후 삼한을 통일하고 더 나아가 압록강까지 수복한다는 내용의 은어로 된 글들을 해석한후, 왕건과 자신들의 안전을 위해 거짓으로 꾸며서 왕건을 위기에서 구했다는 궁예의 문인들이였던 송함홍, 백탁, 허원 등의 경우들을 봐도, 대개의 유학자들과 유학 계열의 문인들 역시, 자신을 신으로 여기면서, 사람들에게 자신을 신격화시키고 신으로서의 숭배를 강요하는 궁예의 행동들에 반감을 가지고 있었음을 짐작할 수 있다.
수덕만세 3년(913년) 왕건을 파진찬 겸 문하시중으로 임명해 수도로 불러들인지 1년만인 정개 원년(914년)에, 견훤이 나주를 공략해 오자 ""수군의 장수가 지위가 미천해서 위엄을 널리 보일 수 없다.""며 다시 왕건을 시중에서 해임하고 백선장군으로 삼아 나주로 내려 보냈다. 이는 왕건 자신 또한 바라던 바이기도 했다. 지위가 시중에 이르면서 주변에는 그를 시기하는 무리들이 생겨났고 궁예가 언젠가 자신에게 칼을 겨누게 될 것이라 생각해 위기의식을 느낀 왕건 스스로가 궁예에게 자청하여 변방으로 나갈 것을 청했던 것이다. 궁예는 그로 하여금 다시 수군을 지휘하게 했고, 왕건이 다시 수군을 맡게 되자 한때 나주 지역을 압박해 오던 후백제와 나주 지역의 해상 군소 해상 세력들은 다시 위축되었다. 왕건은 나주 지역을 안정시키고 돌아와 해전과 해상 무역에 대한 계책들을 진언하자, 궁예는 ""나의 여러 장수들 중에 누가 이 사람과 비길만 하겠는가?""며 왕건에 대한 칭찬을 아끼지 않았다. 그러나 궁예는 한편으로는 왕건의 세력과 입지가 강화되자 점차 위협을 느끼고 있었다.
정개 2년(915년), 그의 포악함을 보다 못한 왕후 강(康)씨가 자신에게 간언하자, ""네가 다른 남자와 간통하고 있지 않느냐. 나는 관심법으로 보아서 다 알고 있다.""며 불에 달군 쇠방망이를 가져다 왕후의 음부를 지져 죽이고, 자신의 두 아들마저 죽였다. 소위 '관심법'이라 칭하며 사람의 마음을 읽는 비상한 재주가 있다고 스스로 떠벌이곤 해서 수많은 장군들과 문신들을 역모죄로 몰아 죽이는 등 가혹한 공포정치를 행했다.

정변과 죽음
918년 7월 24일(음력 6월 을묘일), 궁예의 숙청에 위기의식과 반감을 느낀 신숭겸(申崇謙), 홍유(洪儒), 복지겸(卜智謙), 배현경(裵玄慶) 등의, 태봉에서 형성되고 성장한 직업 군인 세력들과 예전에 왕건이 시중 시절 청주인인 입방, 신전, 관서가 같은 청주인이고 궁예의 총애를 받았던 아지태에게 참소를 당해 위기에 처한 것을 구해준 것을 계기로 궁예에게서 이탈한 일부 청주인들이 주동이 되어서 패서 지역(경기도 북부와 황해도, 평양과 평안남도 남부 지역의 구 고구려계 지역) 호족들과 최응, 송함홍, 백탁, 허원 등의 유학자 관료들의 지지를 받아서 왕건을 추대할 계획을 세우고, 한밤중에 정변을 일으켜 대궐로 쳐들어갔다. 흔히 왕건의 이 역성혁명은 왕건을 중심으로 한 패서 지역의 고구려계 호족들이 주도적으로 나섰다는 이야기가 많은데 실제 고려사를 보면 왕건이 역성혁명을 성공시켜 고려를 건국한 이후 논공행상을 베풀었을 때 상을 받은 개국공신의 명단을 보면 의외로 패서 지역의 옛 고구려계 대호족들이 전혀 없고, 또 역성혁명에 가담한 사람들의 숫자도 너무나 터무니없이 적은 점을 알 수 있다.
흔히 패서 지역의 옛 고구려계 대호족이라고 할 수 있는 박지윤, 황보제궁, 유천궁이나 왕건의 후삼국통일에 결정적인 공을 세운 후삼국시대 최대의 명장인 평주의 유금필도 보이지 않고, 궁예 정권에서 왕건의 목숨을 구한 왕건 시대의 가장 뛰어난 문신이였던 최응도, 고경참문 사건에서 왕건의 목숨을 구한 송함홍, 백탁, 허원 같은 궁예의 궁 내부의 왕건 지지 세력도 보이지 않고, 왕건의 명을 받아 훈요 10조를 받아적은 박술희도 보이지 않고, 왕건의 주요 세력 기반중 하나인 나주 지역도, 그리고 왕건의 처가댁 호족 세력들도 보이지 않는다.
고려사의 기록에 의하면 고려를 건국한 왕건의 역성혁명에 대한 논공행상에서 개국공신 1등 공신과 2등 공신으로 임명된 공신들의 명단은 1등 공신에 홍유, 신숭겸, 배현경, 복지겸이며 2등 공신에 견권, 능식, 염상, 김락, 연주, 마난이 보일 뿐이다. 그외에 고려사 환선길 열전을 보면 왕건의 고려 건국 이후 환선길과 그의 아우 환향식이 왕건을 죽이기 위해 암살모의를 했지만, 환선길이 군사 50여명을 거느리고 왕건에게 다가가자 왕건은 태연하게 ""짐이 이 자리에 오른 것이 비록 너희들 덕분이지만 어찌 천명이 아니겠느냐. 천명이 이미 정해졌는데 너희가 이럴 수 있다는 말이냐!"" 라고 소리치자 왕건이 복병을 숨겨놓은 것으로 오인해 도주하다가 동생과 더불어 왕건의 추격병들에게 잡혀 죽었다는 이야기가 있는 것을 근거로 학계에서는 환선길 형제도 왕건의 역성혁명에 가담했지만 곧 논공행상에 대한 불만으로 반역을 저질렀고, 이후 반역을 저지른 것 때문에 공신 명단에서 빠진 것으로 보고 있고, 또 고려사 태평 열전을 보면 태평은 궁예 시절부터 왕건을 위해 일했고, 왕건의 역성혁명 때 공을 세웠다고 쓰여 있어 태평도 왕건의 역성혁명의 공신중 하나일 것으로 생각해도 무리는 아닐 것이다. 또 고려사 견권 열전을 보아도 청주 출신이지만 왕건을 지지한 사람으로 같은 청주 사람이지만 재경 청주인들인 김근겸, 김관준, 김언규 등을 제거할 것을 왕건에게 권고하지만 왕건은 그들은 있는 힘을 다해 자신을 도운 사람들이라며 거절한 경우가 기록된 것으로 보았을 때 김근겸, 김관준, 김언규도 포함한다면 왕건의 공신 수는 현재까지 확인이 되는 수가 17명 정도로 이 숫자는 조선왕조건국 당시의 개국공신 수인 52명과 세조의 계유정난 정난공신 43명에 비해 터무니없이 적은 수이고, 더군다나 박지윤, 황보제궁, 유천궁 같은 패서 지역의 고구려계 대호족들이 명단에 전혀 없는 것을 보아서 실제 이들이 궁예의 숙청을 예견해 선제 반란을 일으켰다는 이야기는 근거가 부실한 편이다.
오히려 하현강이나 정청주, 조인성 같은 궁예에 호의적인 학자들의 말대로 왕건을 지지하는 세력들은 당연히 존재했지만, 패서 지역 호족들을 등에 업은 궁예의 황후 강씨의 사건이 진압된 이후 큰 충격을 받은 궁예는 이를 계기로 자신의 친위세력들을 이용해 자신에게 반대하는 세력들을 지속적으로 철저하게 감시하고 숙청한 관계로 이들 패서 지역의 고구려계 호족들 뿐만이 아니라 기타 왕건을 지지하는 반궁예세력들이 왕건의 역성혁명때까지 제대로 결집할 수가 없었다고 하는 것이 근거가 있어 보인다.
그럼에도 불구하고 궁예는 지나친 폭정으로 인해 민심과 군심, 그리고 신료들의 이반으로 인해 반궁예 세력들에 대한 지속적이고 철저한 감시와 숙청에도 불구하고 본래 궁예의 지지층이였던, 애초에 대호족들과는 거리가 먼, 복지겸을 제외하면 모두 농민 출신의 전문 군인들이였던 홍유, 배현경, 신숭겸, 복지겸의 4기장과 염상, 김락 같은 인물들과 그리고 궁예의 가장 핵심 지지층이였던 청주 지역 출신의 환선길, 환향식, 견권, 김근겸, 김관준, 김언규 등의 청주 세력의 일부가 궁예에게 등을 돌리고 배신을 한데다가 수많은 전쟁으로 단련된 뛰어난 군사전략가이자 거듭된 전공과 시중으로 있을 당시 선정을 베풀어 민심과 군심의 지지를 얻은 왕건과 경서와 사서에 통달하고 관리로서의 실무에 밝고 익숙했던 태평 같은 인물을 막지 못하고 몰락한 것으로 보인다. 또 옛 백제계 지역인 웅주를 이흔암이 정벌하러 가 중앙의 군사력이 약화되었을 때 정변을 일으켜 거사를 성공시킨 일면도 있었다.

궁예는 철원을 탈출하여 달아나다가 객지에서 죽었다. 《삼국사기》는 화전민들에게 발각되고 해를 입어 죽었다고 되어 있고 《고려사》는 산골짜기에서 이틀 밤을 머물다가 허기져서 보리 이삭을 잘라 먹다가 성난 군중들에게 맞아 죽었다고 되어 있으며, 야사와 전설에는 왕건과의 전투에서 패배해 연천군 청산면 장탄리 자살바위에서 자결했다고 전해진다. 궁예가 철원으로 도읍을 처음 옮겼을 때 눈에 보이는 돌마다 구멍이 숭숭 나 있는 것을 보고 왕조의 몰락을 직감했다는 설화가 있다. 이것의 정확한 이야기는 백성들이 물러나라고 난리치자 ""한탄강가의 돌에 좀이 슬기 전까지는 물러날 수 없다!""라고 일갈했다. 그런데 다음날 득달 같이 한탄강 주변에 가 봤더니 진짜로 돌에 좀이 슬어 있었고, 이것을 궁예에게 보여주며 물러나라고 하자 궁예가 ""내 운수가 다했구나""라며 탄식하며 성을 버리고 나갔다는 이야기이다. 현무암 지대인 철원의 자연 지리적 특징과 태봉의 역사가 결합된 설화의 사례라고 할 수 있다. 해당 지역에서는 종종 ""곰보 돌""로 부르는 것 같다. 또 궁예의 정치적 고향인 철원의 민간 전승에도 '삼국사기'와 고려사, 고려사절요, 동국통감과 사실상 마찬가지로 죄없는 사람을 무수히 죽였다는 이야기도 있고, 또 자신의 안전을 위해 무녀에게 점을 치게 하자, 그 무녀는 18세 된 여자의 유방을 먹으라는 의견을 올렸고 그래서 많이, 혹은 매일 인육을 먹었다는 '삼국사기'와 고려사, 고려사절요, 동국통감의 역사서들의 기록들보다 더 악독한 만행도 전해지고 있다. 또 이와는 반대로 《광산이씨소고》에 따르면 궁예왕은 측근 몇 사람을 거느리고 현 평강(平康) 방면으로 도주 중 수풀 속에 숨은 백성들의 죽창에 찔려 삼방(三防)땅에 이르러 말 위에서 분사했으나 생시처럼 꼿꼿히 앉아 있었다 한다. 왕건이 달려와 조문하나 유해는 움직이지 않으므로 모든 사람이 겁내어 부득이 직립한 채로 입관케 하여 석축으로 수십 길이나 높다란 분묘를 만들어 군주의 예에 따라 정중히 장례를 지냈다고 하며 오래도록 연 1회 향사를 올렸다고 전한다. 또 다른 철원 지방 민간 전승에는 궁예가 철원을 도읍지로 삼았을 때, 한 풍수가의 조언을 받았는데 그 풍수가는 자신이 그만하라고 할 때까지 땅바닥에 엎드려 있으라고 했는데 때마침 무더위와 이상한 소리를 견디지 못한 궁예가 지시를 어기고 도중에 일어나자 풍수가는 300년 도읍지가 될 것이 30년밖에 못 간다고 한탄을 했다는 이야기도 있을 정도이다.

궁예의 죽음으로 태봉은 멸망하고, 왕건은 즉위하여 고려를 건국했다. 한동안 왕건에 반대하는 친궁예 세력들이 건재하여 반란을 일으키거나 후백제에 귀부하기도 했다.
마군장군(馬軍將軍) 환선길은 처음에는 왕건의 정변에 적극 가담해 큰 공을 세웠으나 이후 아내의 권고를 받고(고려사, 고려사절요, 동국통감에는 아내의 권고를 받고 환선길이 그의 동생과 함께 왕건에게 반란을 일으켰다고 나오지만, 실제로는 왕건의 정변 성공 이후 논공행상 과정에서 소외가 되어 반란을 일으켰다고 보는 것이 학계의 일반적인 시각이다.) 그의 동생과 함께 왕건이 고려를 건국한 직후 반란을 일으켰으나 실패해 그의 동생과 함께 처형되었고, 이후 태봉 말기 마군대장군(馬軍大將軍)으로써 웅주(熊州)를 쳐서 차지하고 주둔하던 이흔암은 천수 원년(918년) 6월 왕건의 즉위를 찬탈로 규정하고 정변을 일으킬 목적으로 부임지인 웅주를 무단이탈해 당시 수도인 철원으로 마음대로 돌아왔고, 이후 한찬 수의형대령(守義刑臺令)이었던 염장(閻萇) 등이 그에게 반란을 일으킬 뜻이 있음을 탐지해 밀고했고,이에 왕건은 몰래 사람을 붙여 이흔함을 감시하다가 이은함 처의 반역 실토 발언을 빌미삼아 이흔암을 체포해 시장 바닥에 끌어내서 공개 참형을 했고, 그로부터 2개월 뒤 웅주는 운주(運州) 등 10여 주현과 함께 후백제에 귀부해 버렸다. 9월에는 순군리였던 임춘길(林春吉)과 그의 일당들이 반역을 꾀하다 처형당했고 그 다음달인 10월달에는 청주의 진선과 선장 형제도 반역을 꾀하다가 처형되었다. 거의 대부분 공주, 또는 청주 지역의 구 백제계 지역 호족들이었다.
명주의 성주 김순식도 왕건이 고려를 건국하고 즉위한 뒤로도 오랫동안 항복하지 않아, 왕건이 천수 4년(922년) 7월에 김순식의 아버지이고 승려인 허월(許越)을 보내 타일렀을 때에도 장자 수원(守元)만 보내고 자신은 오지 않았다. 천수 9년(927년) 8월에도 사실상 마찬가지로 자신의 아들 장명(長命)만을 보내어 숙위하게 했을 뿐 김순식 자신은 오지 않다가, 왕건에게 저항한지 11년째인 이듬해 1월에야 직접 왕건을 찾아서 알현함으로써 완전히 왕건에게 귀부하게 되었다.

전설
《삼국사기》 및 《고려사》는 특히 궁예의 최후에 대해서, 미복차림으로 도망치던 중에 해를 입어 죽었다고 되어 있으나, 민간의 전승에서는 궁예가 오히려 왕건을 상대로 상당기간 동안 항전을 벌이다 죽었다고 하는 전승들을 전하고 있다. 유명한 것이 포천 산정호수와 철원군 갈말읍 인근의 명성산 전설로, 왕건에게 쫓긴 궁예의 말년을 슬퍼해서 산새들이 울었다고 해서 명성산이라는 이름이 붙었다는 것이다. 명성산 주변에는 궁예가 피신해서 이름이 붙었다는 개적동굴, 궁예가 왕건의 군사가 쫓아오는 것을 살폈다는 망무봉의 지명 유래담이 내려오고 있다. 또한, 철원의 보개산성, 운악산성, 명성산성에는 궁예가 왕건에 맞서 상당기간 항전했다는 민간전승들이 전해내려 오고 있는데, 이와 관련해 패주골은 궁예가 싸움에 패한 고을이라 붙은 이름이고, 궁예와 그의 군사들이 한탄하며 도망쳐서 군탄리가 되었다는 전승들이 있고 패주를 거듭하던 궁예는 평강에서 자살하거나 민중에게 살해되었다는 이야기가 있다. 이와 반대로 위에서 이야기 되었듯이 궁예에 대해서 부정적인 민간전승들도 전하고 있다. 궁예의 정치적 고향인 철원과 그 근처 지방에서 유래된 민간전승들인 앞서 이야기된 '한탄강'의 곰보 바위 전설이나 궁예가 대궐터를 정했을 때 한 풍수가가 자신의 지시가 있기 전까지는 엎드려 있으라고 했는데, 찌는 듯한 더위와 이상한 소리를 참지 못해 중간에 일어나서 이에 그 풍수가는 이곳은 300년 도읍지인데 참지 못하고 일어서는 바람에 30년밖에 도읍터가 될 수 없다라는 이야기와 '삼국사기'와 고려사, 고려사절요, 동국통감과 마찬가지로 죄없는 사람을 무수히 죽였다는 이야기도 있고, 또 자신의 안전을 위해 무녀에게 점을 치게 하자, 그 무녀는 18세된 여자의 유방을 먹으라는 의견을 올렸고 그래서 많이, 혹은 매일 인육을 먹었다는 '삼국사기'와 고려사, 고려사절요, 동국통감의 역사서들의 기록들보다 더 악독한 만행도 전해지고, '한탕강' 일화에서는 돌에 좀이 슬자 성을 버리고 도망간 궁예가 정사(正史)들('삼국사기'와 고려사, 고려사절요, 동국통감.)과 마찬가지로 상방에서 백성들에게 살해당했고 살해당한 이후 마련된 그의 묘를 그냥 지나가는 사람들은 움직일 수 없었는데 무덤에 제사를 지내주면 비로서 자유롭게 통행할 수 있었다라는 이야기와 이후 조선시대 한 함경감사가 말의 피를 궁예 묘에 뿌린 후부터는 제사를 지내지 않고도 그의 묘를 자유롭게 지나갈 수 있었다라는 이야기들이 있고, 그리고 그의 무덤을 도굴할려는 사람에게는 천변을 내리고 그의 궁궐터에 있는 소나무는 학질 환자를 치유해주는 효험이 있다는 민간의 이야기들이 있다.

《삼국사기》와 《고려사》는 대부분 궁예를 축출한 왕건 세력에 의해 편찬된 텍스트를 저본 자료로 삼은 것이며, 왕조 시대의 전형적인 흥망사관에 입각해 왕건의 쿠데타를 정당화하고 그 쿠데타로 인해 추방된 궁예가 얼마나 잔인하고 난폭했으며 의심을 많이 품었고 폭정을 일삼았다는 것만을 강조하는 면이 크나 고려사 홍유 열전과 고려사 세가 934년의 왕건의 조서 기록들에 따르면 말년에 가서야 폭군이 되었다고 말해주는 기록들도 있어서 그가 황제가 된 이후 시종일관 잔인하고 난폭하고 의심이 많다라는 이야기를 부정하는 이야기들도 있으므로 실제로는 재위 말년에 가서야 궁예가 비로서 폭군이 되었다는 것에 힌트를 주는 면도 있다. 궁예가 폭군으로 불리게 된 것은 고려왕조 측의 조작들이 당연히 있었겠지만, 그가 전제 왕권을 구축하기 위한 과정에서 너무나 무리하고 과격한 수들을 썼기 때문이라고 할 수 있다.

반신라 정책과 신라 출신 귀순자들의 학살
우선 고구려 계승을 표방하며 신라를 '멸도'라고 부르고 신라에서 귀순해오는 자들은 모두 죽였다고 하는 기록부터, 기존의 학설은 《삼국사기》 궁예전의 기록을 바탕으로 ""신라 왕실로부터 버림받았기 때문에 그것에 대한 원한을 품고"" 행한 감정에 치우친 행동으로만 치부하는 것이 일반적이었다. 그러나 궁예가 처음 일어날 당시의 지지 기반과 왕건과의 차이점, 나아가 신라로부터의 귀순자들에 대한 분석이 이루어지면서, 어느 정도 궁예의 행동에도 설득력이 부여되고 있다. 궁예가 처음 거병할 당시의 지지기반은 신라 말의 초적으로, 이들 초적들은 극심한 천재지변에 신라 왕실과 진골 귀족들의 가혹한 수탈을 견디지 못해 무장화하여 도적으로까지 불리게 된 이들로서 신라 조정에 대한 적대적인 감정을 가진 자들이었다. 정통 호족 출신이었던 왕건이 신라 귀순자들을 너그럽게 다 받아주었던 것과는 달리, 초적을 규합하여 하나의 세력을 이룬 궁예로서는 신라 조정이나 그로부터 귀순해온 세력들에 대해서 마냥 우호적일 수만은 없었다라는 이야기도 있지만, 2008년 조인성의 저서인 (태봉의 궁예정권)195P를 보면 궁예의 이 신라 귀순자 대량 학살은 과장되었을 것으로 보인다라는 이야기가 있고, 여기서 궁예의 신라 출신 귀순자들의 대량 학살은 당시 신라의 지배층들에 한정이 된다고 나오며, 또 더 나아가서 궁예는 신라에서 넘어온 귀족 모두를 학살했다고라고 여겨지지 않는다는 이야기가 있다. 실제로 918년 왕건의 역성혁명 때 왕건을 황제로 만드는데 1등 공신들이였던 홍유, 신숭겸, 배현경, 복지겸을 보면 이중에 홍유는 신라 지역인 경북 의성 출신이고, 배현경은 본관이 경주 배씨인 것을 감안하면 잘 알 수 있다. 궁예가 신라 출신 귀순자들을 모조리 학살했다면 이들이 궁예가 다스리던 나라의 고위급 장군이 될 수가 없었을 것이다.

개인적인 신격화
궁예가 지은 경전을 보고 ""하나같이 요사스러운 말로 교훈거리가 될 수 없다.""고 혹평하여 궁예에게 살해된 석총이라는 승려와 관련해 《삼국유사》에는 《왕대종족기》를 인용해, ""진표의 제자인 석충(釋忠)이 간자 108개를 태조에게 바쳤다.""고 적고 있는데 《삼국사기》의 석총과 《왕대종족기》의 석충은 동일인물로 여겨진다. 또한 궁예가 지향했던 불교와 석총의 불교가 같은 법상종 계열이면서도 궁예는 아미타불, 관음보살 중심이었던 데 반해서 석총은 미륵보살, 지장보살 중심이었던 차이점이 지적되어, 양자간에 알력은 일찍부터 있었으며 적어도 《삼국사기》에 기록된 것처럼 감정적으로 울컥해서 죽이지만은 않았을 것으로 여겨지기도 하지만 앞서 이야기되었듯이 근본적으로 석총의 입장에서는 불교의 종파를 떠나서 궁예가 억지스러운 불교 경전들을 짓고, 미륵으로 행세하는 식의, 정통 불교 교리를 근본적으로 파괴하는 억지스러운 자기 신격화를 추진하는 것에 대해 정통 불교의 승려로서 이를 가만히 보고 있을 수 없었을 것이고, 이외에도 917년에 선종 계열의 승려로, 후백제 지역에서 건너와 활동했던 형미도 궁예에게 죽임을 당했다고 전해져, 궁예가 억지스러운 불교 경전들을 짓고, 미륵으로 행세하는 식의, 정통 불교 교리를 파괴하는 억지스러운 자기 신격화를 추진하는 것에 대해 불교계가 거센 반발을 하고 있음을 알 수 있고, 또 유학자들의 경우도 본래 궁예의 최측근이였다가 궁예에게 죽을뻔한 왕건을 살려준후, 궁예를 등지고 왕건의 최측근이 된 유학자 최응과 태봉 시절 궁예의 태자인 청광보살의 사부의 벼슬이였던 동궁기실로 있다가 궁예의 왕비 강씨와 강씨의 두 아들이 처형된 전후에 궁을 탈출해 승려가 되었다가, 역시 왕건이 고려를 건국하여 집권한 후 돌아와 왕건의 신료가 되어 왕건에게 최초로 왕씨 성을 하사받은 왕유(본명 박유.)의 경우와 궁예가 몰락한 해인 918년 3월, 왕창근이 한 기이한 노인에게서 얻은 거울에 적힌 왕건이 궁예를 멸망시킨 후 삼한을 통일하고 더 나아가 압록강까지 수복한다는 내용의 은어로 된 글들을 해석한 후, 왕건과 자신들의 안전을 위해 거짓으로 꾸며서 왕건을 위기에서 구했다는 궁예의 문인들이였던 송함홍, 백탁, 허원 등의 경우들을 봐도, 대개의 유학자들과 유학 계열의 문인들 역시, 자신을 신으로 여기면서, 사람들에게 자신을 신격화시키고 신으로서의 숭배를 강요하는 궁예의 행동들에 반감을 가지고 있었음을 짐작할 수 있다.

왕건과의 관계
《삼국사기》에는 궁예와 왕건 사이에 있었던 일화 한 가지가 소개되어 있다. 하루는 궁예가 왕건을 대궐 안으로 급히 불러들였다. 마침 처벌된 자들로부터 몰수한 물품들을 점검하고 있던 궁예는 왕건을 보자 성난 표정으로 ""경이 어젯밤에 사람들을 모아 반란을 일으키려 했다는데 사실인가?"" 라고 물었고, 왕건은 태연하게 웃으면서 ""어찌 그럴리가 있겠습니까?""라고 대답했다. 이에 궁예가 다그치며 ""나를 속이지 말라. 나는 능히 사람의 마음을 궤뚫어볼 수 있다. 지금 곧 정신을 집중시켜 그대의 마음을 꿰뚫어보리라."" 하고는 눈을 감고 뒷짐을 지더니 한참 동안 하늘을 쳐다보았는데, 이 때 최응이 옆에 있다가 가만히 붓을 떨어뜨리고는 그것을 줍는 척하면서 왕건에게 ""스스로 자복하지 않으면 목숨이 위험할 겁니다.""라고 중얼거리고 지나갔고 왕건은 곧 ""사실은 제가 모반을 계획하였습니다. 죽을 죄를 지었습니다.""라며 거짓으로 자복했다. 그러나 궁예는 오히려 ""경은 과연 정직한 사람이다. 다시는 나를 속이지 말라""며 왕건에게 주연까지 베풀어 주고 금은으로 장식한 말안장과 굴레와 금 한 덩이를 왕건에게 특별히 내려주었다고 한다. 이 기록은 흔히 궁예의 폭정과 왕건의 기지를 보여주기 위한 기록으로 해석된다.

기타
21세기에 이르러서는 애꾸눈에 승려라는 외모가 묘하게 재미있어서 인터넷 밈으로 많이 사용되었다. 게다가 인기 게임인 스트리트 파이터 시리즈의 보스급 캐릭터인 사가트도 궁예와 똑같이 애꾸눈에 대머리인지라 같이 엮여서 인터넷 밈이 되는 경우도 많다.

처자
《삼국사기》에는 궁예의 가족에 대해 왕비 강씨가 있었다고 적고 있으며 신광과 청광이라 불린 아들은 강씨 소생인 것으로 비정하는 데 이견이 없다. 조정이 편찬한 기록 외에 후대의 광산 이씨가 궁예의 첫째 아들 신광의 후손을 자처했으며 순천 김씨 또한 둘째 청광의 후손을 자처하기도 했으나 현재는 두 가문 모두 인정하지 않고 있다.

생애
이덕무의 《앙엽기》(盎葉記), 이만운의 《기년아람》(紀年兒覽), 안정복의 《동사강목》(東史綱目)에 따르면 기자조선의 제1대 군주인 기자는 기원전 1126년부터 기원전 1082년까지 재위했다고 한다. 또한 그의 휘는 서여(胥餘) 또는 수유(須臾)였고 시호는 태조문성왕(太祖文聖王)이라고 한다. 그의 왕위는 장혜왕(송(松))이 승계받았다고 한다.
기자에 대한 전설은 ‘상나라의 왕족 기자’와 ‘기자동래설’의 두 가지로 나눌 수 있다.
기자는 상나라의 왕족으로 폭군 주왕의 친척이었다. 상나라의 태사(太師)로 관직에 있을 무렵 주왕이 폭정을 행하는 것을 보고 이를 그만둘 것을 간언하였다가 감옥에 갇혔다. 이에 기자는 거짓으로 미친 척하여 주왕은 그를 노비로 삼았다고 한다. 기원전 1122년에 상나라가 주나라 무왕에게 멸망당하고 기자를 석방하여 신하로 삼고자 하였으나 기자는 이를 거부하고 은둔하였다. 기자는 주나라의 무왕이 천도(天道)를 묻자 홍범구주(洪範九疇)를 진술하기도 하였다고 하며 기원전 1119년에 주나라 왕실에 조빙(朝聘)하였다고 한다.
한편, 기자동래설은 위의 기자 전설과 약간 다르다. 상나라가 멸망하자 기자는 주나라의 신하가 되는 것을 거부하고 조선으로 망명하였으며 이에 주나라 무왕은 기자를 조선에 봉하였다고 한다. 기자는 5천여 명의 무리와 함께 조선으로 와서 조선의 백성들에게 문명을 가르쳤다고 한다. 일부 기록에서는 기자가 건너오자 원래 조선의 군주였던 단군이 기자를 피해 장당경으로 옮겨 갔다고 나타난다. 기자는 평양에 도읍을 두고 8조의 법금을 베풀어 나라를 다스렸다. 또한 정전제(井田制)를 실시하고 농사짓는 법과 누에치는 법을 가르쳐 백성들이 기뻐했다고 한다.
기자의 사망한 시기는 정확하게 알 수 없으나 홍만종의 《동국역대총목(東國歷代總目)》에는 《진조통기(震朝通紀)》라는 작자 미상의 서적을 인용하여 기원전 1083년(무오년)에 93세로 사망하였다고 기록하고 있다.

기자동래설
기자동래설이란 기자가 상나라가 멸망한 이후 동쪽으로 망명해와 고조선의 왕이 되어 1000여 년 동안 다스렸다는 전설이다. 기자동래설은 대체로 한나라(기원전 2세기) 이후의 문헌에서 집중적으로 나타난다. 한나라 이전의 문헌(선진문헌{先秦文獻})에는 기자가 주나라의 지배를 거부하고 은둔하였던 사실만 기록하고 있으며, 그 이후 기자의 삶은 거의 나타나지 않는다.

생성과 발전
기자동래설이 나타나는 최초의 문헌은 《상서대전(尙書大典)》과 《사기》이다. 《상서대전》은 중국 최초의 역사서로 평가되는 《상서》에 주석과 본문을 추가한 유교 경전으로 한나라 이전의 《상서》에는 나타나지 않는 기자동래설이 추가되어 있다. 《상서대전》에 따르면 기자는 주나라의 지배를 거부하고 조선으로 망명하였다고 하며 주나라 무왕은 이를 듣고 기자를 조선에 봉하였다고 한다. 한편 《사기》 〈송미자세가〉에도 기자가 조선의 군주가 되었다고 기록되어 있는데 《상서대전》과 반대로 무왕이 기자를 조선에 봉하여 기자가 조선에 가서 나라를 일으켰다고 한다. 이러한 두 문헌의 차이는 이후 기자가 스스로의 힘으로 조선을 세웠는지, 아니면 주나라의 제후국으로 조선을 세웠는지를 놓고 논쟁이 벌어지는 원인이 되었다. 이후 《한서》와 《삼국지》에서 계속해서 기자동래설을 기록하는 한편 기자 이후의 고조선 역사에 대해서도 기자와 연관시켜 기록하였다.
이러한 기자동래설에 대한 기본 문헌들이 성립되자 이후부터 기자동래설의 사실 여부와 관계없이 기자를 조선의 군주로 숭상하는 경향이 많아졌다. 삼국시대에도 고구려가 기자에게 제사를 지냈다고 하며 신라의 최치원도 기자동래설을 긍정하였다. 고려시대에는 유교가 통치 이념으로 점차 굳어져 가면서 한국 유교문화의 시원적 존재로 기자에 대한 숭배가 강화되었다. 그 결과 1102년에는 평양에 기자사당이 세워져 국가의 제사를 받았으며 기자의 묘까지 만들어졌다. 이후 조선 초기에는 단군과 기자가 나란히 국조로 숭상되었으며 《동국사략》에서 단군조선·기자조선·위만조선의 삼조선으로 이어지는 체계를 정립하면서 기자조선이라는 왕조가 확고하게 자리잡았다. 성리학이 발달하면서 사림에 의해 기자 존숭 의식은 더욱 발전하였고, 이이의 《기자실기(箕子實記)》와 같은 기자를 존숭하는 서적까지 편찬되었다. 개항기 이후에도 기자에 대한 존숭 의식은 계속되었으나 자주성을 강조하기 위해 기자가 무왕에 의해 조선의 군주로 책봉된 것이 아니라 기자가 조선의 군주가 되고 난 후에 무왕이 책봉하였다는 해석이 지배적이 되었다.

기자동래설에 대한 비판
기자동래설은 삼국시대 이래 오랫동안 사실로 여겨왔으나 현대에 들어서는 많은 비판을 받아 사실이 아닌 조작이라는 주장이 지배적이다. 특히 기자에 관한 문헌을 분석한 결과 한나라 이전 문헌에서는 기자가 조선으로 갔다는 내용이 없고, 한나라가 고조선을 멸망시킬 무렵부터 나타나기 시작한 점이 중요한 근거가 된다. 또한 고고학적으로도 고조선과 상나라·주나라의 문화가 명백하게 차이를 보이는 점도 중요한 근거다. 평양에는 기자와 관련된 유적들이 존재하는데, 실제 고고학적으로 평양의 유적들은 고려·조선시대에 만들었다는 게 이 주장을 뒷받침한다.
기자동래설이 등장한 배경으로는 보통 중국 특유의 중화의식을 지적한다. 고대 중국은 주변 이민족을 기록할 때 항상 중국 고대 인물의 후손으로 기록하였다. 이러한 배경 아래에서 조선의 시조를 기자로 간주하는 시각이 있었다고 본다. 또한 이러한 중국 측 시각에 편승하여 주변 이민족들이 자신들의 시조를 중국의 고대 인물이라 주장하는 모화(慕華) 의식이 많이 나타나는데, 삼국시대 이후로 나타난 기자 존숭 의식도 이와 같은 것이라고 해석한다.
한편 기자동래설에 관해 일부분 긍정하는 주장도 존재한다. 중국 허베이성 동부와 랴오닝성 서부에 해당하는 요서 지방에는 기(箕)라는 명문을 새긴 청동기를 많이 발견했다. 고고학적으로 이들을 기자와 관련된 종족으로 보는데 이들이 점차 동쪽으로 이주하면서 고조선의 지배계층을 대체하거나 합쳤다는 견해다. 기자 혹은 기자족이 동쪽으로 이동한 사실을 긍정하면서 기자가 기자조선이라는 국가를 성립한 게 아니지만 후에 기자와 관련된 인물이 조선의 지배층이 되면서 기자조선 전설로 발전하였다는 견해도 있다. 다만 굉장히 점진적으로 변화한다는 한계가 있으며, 기후라고 새겨진 청동기는 고조선의 초기 중심지로 추정되는 요서가 아닌 산둥성을 위주로 다른 주변국과 부족의 명칭이 새겨진 청동기와 섞여서 출토되기 때문에, 이는 출토된 지역에 국가를 형성했다기 보다는 교역이나 이주 등으로 인해 우연히 '기후'명 청동기가 입수되었을 가능성에 더 가깝다고 할 수 있다.
일부 재야사학자들은 기자 또는 기자의 후손이 고조선의 일부인 번조선의 왕이 되었고, 이 때문에 기자조선 전설이 생겼다고 주장하기도 한다. 그러나 이러한 견해는 대부분 《환단고기》와 같은 위서에 근거하고 있기 때문에 한국사학계에서는 인정하지 않는다.

평가
기자동래설은 현재 한국사학계에서 사실이 아니라고 평가된다. 하지만 기자동래설이 삼국시대 이후 한국사에서 차지하는 비중이 매우 크기 때문에 그 영향에 대해서는 다양한 평가가 존재한다. 대체로 이른 시기부터 한국이 중국의 문물을 수용하여 중국에 못지않게 문명국이었다는 것을 내세우려는 상징으로 기자 존숭이 나타났다고 보는 것이 일반적이다.

기자 한민족(韓民族)설
이 주장은 기자가 조선을 건국한 것은 맞지만 기자는 중국인이 아니며 한민족이라는 설이다. 이를 주장하는 학자로는 천관우, 이상시, 이병도 등이 있으며 그 주요 내용은 아래와 같다.

중국 산서성 태곡현 일대에 동이가 세운 기국이 이미 존재하였고, 주나라의 압력을 받아 동방으로 이동하였고, 동진을 계속하여 대동강 유역에 이르렀다는 주장(천관우).
그 내용은 기존의 사서를 따르지만, 동래한 기자는 중국인이 아닌 동이의 인물이라는 주장(이상시).
'한씨 조선설' - 고조선에 기원한 한후(韓候)가 요서로부터 아사달로 이동, 지배세력이 되었다는 주장(이병도).

기타
그는 한국 민간과 무속에서 군왕신(君王神)의 하나로 모셔지며, ‘기자신’(箕子神)이라 부른다. 평양과 황해도 지역의 무속신으로 주로 숭배되었다.
1763년 윤치정의 지인에 의해 애민여자(愛民如子)라고 쓴 기자의 친필 서신이 한 산사에서 발견되었다. 이는 한국 전쟁을 겪으면서 실전되었다.

생애
김덕령은 조선 태종 때 의정부 찬성(贊成)을 지낸 김한로(金漢老 : 양녕대군 장인)의 12대손이다. 광주의 서쪽에 위치한 평장동(지금의 전남 담양군 대전면 대치리)에 집성촌을 이루어 세거하다가 고조할아버지 김문손(金文孫)이 1470년경 광주 노씨(光州盧氏) 부인과 결혼하여 처가 마을인 석저촌으로 들어와 살면서 그곳이 새로운 광산 김씨 집성촌이 되었다. 평장동과 석저촌(지금의 충효동)은 직선거리로는 5km 안팎으로 가깝다. 증조할아버지 김후(金翊)은 호조 정랑을 지냈으나, 할아버지 김윤효와 아버지 김붕섭은 재행(才行)이 있었음에도 벼슬에 나가지 못하였다.

생애 초반
김덕령은 1568년(선조 원년) 12월 29일 전라도 광주 무등산(無等山) 아래 석저촌(石底村)(현 광주광역시 북구 충효동) 성안마을에서 아버지 김붕섭(金鵬燮)과 직장(直長) 반계종(潘繼宗)의 딸인 어머니 남평 반씨(南平潘氏)의 3남 3녀 중 둘째아들로 태어나, 위로는 형 덕홍(德弘)과 누나 3명이, 아래로는 아우 덕보(德普)가 있다.
집안이 대대로 유학을 숭상하여 유업(儒業)에 종사하여, 어려서부터 종조부(從祖父) 사촌(沙村) 김윤제의 별장인 환벽당에서 글공부하며 유아(儒雅)를 쌓기 시작하였고, 14세에 부친을 여의었다. 17세에 향해(鄕解, 초시)에 합격하고, 18세 때 담양에 사는 흥양 이씨(興陽李氏) 부인과 혼인하였다. 20세에 형 덕홍(德弘), 매부 김응회(金應會), 묵재 이귀(李貴) 등과 함께 우계(牛溪) 성혼(成渾)의 문하에서 성리학을 배웠다. 어려서부터 무등산에서 말타기와 칼쓰기 등 무예를 익혔다고 한다.
당시 조정에서는 서인과 동인(東人)의 정권 싸움이 치열하였는데, 이런 가운데 1589년(선조 22년) 정여립의 난이 일어났다. 이때 서인의 좌의정 정철(鄭澈)이 위관(委官 : 재판장)으로서 동인의 과격파 이발(李潑) 등 1천여 명을 숙청하는 기축옥사를 일으키며, 이로 말미암아 동인의 원망을 크게 샀다. 김덕령은 성혼의 제자로서 서인 계열에 속하였고, 정철과는 동향(同鄕)이었으므로, 뒷날 동인 출신 대간(臺諫)들로부터 의병장 김덕령이 군율을 너무 엄격하게 적용하여 군사를 죽였다고 탄핵받기도 하였다.

임진왜란과 의병 활동
한편 김덕령의 뜻은 공부에 있었고, 활쏘기와 말타기가 있지 아니했으나, 임진왜란이 발생하여 형 덕홍이 전사하고, 어머니가 돌아가자, 나라의 수치와 형의 원수를 생각하며 날을 지내었다. 마침내 주변 사람들의 권유로 의병을 모아 거병하였다.

의병 조직
1592년(선조 25년) 4월 13일 김덕령이 25세 때 임진왜란이 일어나자, 그해 6월에 김덕령은 형 김덕홍(1558∼1592)과 함께 의병을 일으켜 고경명(高敬命)을 찾아가서 박광옥(朴光玉) 등과 함께 그의 막하에서 의병으로 활동하며 전주에 이르렀을 때 돌아가서 어머니를 봉양하라는 형의 권고에 따라 고향 광주로 귀향하였다. 무등산에서 무예를 닦고, 주검동(鑄劒洞)에서 무기를 만들어 전쟁터로 보급하는 등 후방에서 관병·의병 활동을 지원하였다.
다음 달 7월 10일 형 김덕홍이 제1차 금산전투에서 호남을 침범하려는 고바야카와 다카카게[小早隆景]의 일본군을 맞아 싸우다가 전사하였다.
1593년(선조 26년) 6월, 제2차 진주성 전투에서 조선군이 대패함에 따라, 조정에서는 경상도 서부를 방비할 장병이 부족해지자 호남에서 유능한 장수를 뽑아 경상도로 보내기로 하였다. 이는 제1차 진주성 전투에서 진주목사 김시민에게 당한 패배를 설욕하려고 제2차 진주성 전투 과정 및 승전 후 진주 사람 수만 명을 죽였기 때문이다. 8월에는 진주 전투에서 순국한 의병들의 의(義)로움을 잇다는 계의병(繼義兵)이 일어났다.
그해 8월 노모마저 세상을 떠났다. 상중임에도 그의 매형인 김응회(金應會)와 종조부 김윤경의 외손자인 송제민이 의병을 일으키라 권하고, 아우 김덕보가 대신 삼년상을 치르기로 하자 거병을 결심한다. 10월에는 담양부사 이경린(李景麟), 장성현감 이귀(李貴) 등이 천거하여 그에 전라도 관찰사 이정암(李廷馣)이 직접 찾아와서 국가의 위급함을 구제하도록 권면하였다.
《난중잡록》에 따르면, 그해 윤11월 4일 친구 최담령(崔聃齡) 등 수십 명과 함께 다시 의병을 담양에서 일으키고, 논밭을 팔아 무기를 마련하고 격문(檄文)을 띄워 군사를 모집하니, 정병(精兵)이 1천여 명이 모였다.
현직 관료인 담양부사 이경린과 장성현감 이귀도 김덕령을 적극 도와주었다. 관내의 병역기피자들을 색출하여 의병에 편입시키었고, 전쟁 물자를 많이 지원하여 주었다. 지역 유지들도 적극 도왔다. 송제민은 제주도까지 가서 말을 가져왔으며, 고봉 기대승의 아들 함재 기효증은 김덕령 의병의 도유사가 되어 각 지방에 통문을 보내어 양곡을 모았다. 김덕령의 친척인 김응회, 이인경,김언욱, 김존경, 김덕후 등도 큰 역할을 하였다. 김응회는 김덕령의 매형으로 김덕령 군대의 핵심참모였고, 이인경은 손위처남으로 군관으로 활약했고, 김언욱(金彦勖)은 고종사촌으로 김덕령 군대의 핵심참모였고, 김존경은 김언욱의 아들로 문장이 뛰어나 문서 작성과 전령 업무를 담당하였다. 김덕휴는 사촌동생인데 김덕령의 비서실장 역할을 하였다.
12월 13일 이정암은 자신이 천거한 김덕령에게 각 고을에 저축한 군량과 병기를 내어줄 수 있도록 분조에 청하여 허락을 받았다. 또한 전혁직 관료도 김덕령을 도왔다. 현직 관료로는 해남 현감 위대기(魏大器)와 군산 만호 이세침(李世琛)이 있고, 전직 관료로는 의병을 일으킬 때부터 도와준 전 별좌(別坐) 김응회와 전 찰방(察訪) 김언욱이 있었다. 한편 이정암이 청한 군량은 11월에 명을 받고 해산한 계의병으로부터 일부 받았다.
하편 이정암의 장계에 따르면, 첫째 모병은 조정의 하명에 따랐으며, 둘째 이정암이 김덕령을 직접 만나 추천할 만한 장수임을 확인했고, 원근에서 그를 좆아서 의병이 많이 모였으며, 셋째 조정에 군량과 병기 등을 지원하고 표창하는 등 사기를 북돋아 줄 것을 요청하였다.

군호를 받다
1593년 12월 22일 김덕령은 담양부사 이경린의 주선으로 전라도 삼례에서 세자 광해군을 만나게 된다. 당시 세자는 무군사(撫軍司)를 이끌고 군인과 백성들을 위로하고 장수를 모집하려고 전주로 내려오는 중이었다.
12월 27일 분조의 광해군은 전주 과거시험장에서 주재하였다. 문과 시관은 좌의정 윤두수, 호조판서 한준, 세자 우빈객 이항복, 문학 유몽인 등이었고, 무과 시관은 좌참찬 이산보, 동지사 박진, 훈련원 첨정 정사시, 병조정랑 조응록 등이었다. 김덕령은 수많은 수험생 앞에서 무예 시범을 보임으로써 국가와 백성들이 인정하는 장수가 되었다. 전주 과거시험에서는 문신 11인과 무신 1천 6백 인이 뽑히었다. 한편 도원수 권율도 무군사의 명령을 받들어 경상도 합천에서 무과시험을 치러 무인 9백 명을 뽑았다.
김덕령이 보인 무술 시범을 보고 흡족한 광해군으로부터 익호장(翼虎將)이라는 칭호와 함께 군기를 수여받았다. 이후 김덕령은 도원수 권율에게도 그간의 경과와 군사상황을 보고하였다. 이 보고를 받은 권율은 김덕령에게 초승장(超乘將)의 군호와 초승군(超乘軍)이란 표장을 내린다.
한편 김덕령이 세자 광해군을 만나 군호를 수여 받는 사이 명군이 경주와 삼지 등에서 철수하는 등 상황은 급박하게 돌아간다. 이에 경상도에 내려가 있던 병조판서 이덕형은 경상도 진주와 경주를 지켜야 함을 역설하며, 그동안 불어나서 3천 명에 이르는 의병을 이끄는 김덕령에게 그 방어를 맡기기를 청한다.
그 보고를 받고 비변사는 급히 선조에게 김덕령의 군대에 초승군이라 칭하고 기치를 내리기를 청하나, 선조는 아직 김덕령에 대해 잘 알지 못하고 큰 공이 없으니, 기치를 내리는 일은 신중히 하라고 명한다. 이틀 뒤, 1594년 1월 1일 선조는 충용장(忠勇將) 및 충용군(忠勇軍)의 군호를 내리지만, 기치를 내리는 일은 보류한다. 1594년 1월 5일 선조는 김덕령을 선전관과 좌랑의 벼슬을 내린다. 이때 아직 군공이 없다는 이유로 고관에 제수하지는 못하였다.
당시 사정이 급박하다고는 하나, 선조가 직접 군호를 내리고 교지까지 남겼다는 것은 김덕령에 대한 선조의 기대가 컸음을 뜻한다.

출병
1594년(선조 27년) 1월초 충용장 군호를 받은 김덕령은 곧바로 서울로 가서 선조의 소명을 받아야 했으나, 사정이 급박하여 김덕령은 무군사의 명을 받아 경상도로 떠난다. 이는 1월 2일 세자 광해군을 따라 전주에 내려와 있던 좌의정 윤두수가 영남의 전선이 위태하니 김덕령의 군대인 충용군을 경상도로 보내겠다고 보고하였기 때문이며, 1월 3일 김덕령도 상소하며 경상도로 떠나기를 청하였다.
1월 5일 선조는 김덕령을 선전관과 정6품 좌랑의 벼슬을 내린다. 1월 6일 김덕령은 장성 임암산성과 담양 금성산성에서 훈련하고 있는 군사들을 모두 담양 추성관으로 모이게 하였다.
격문을 띄우고 김덕령은 담양에서 대기하였는데, 《난중잡록》과 《연려실기술》에는, 김덕령군의 예정 경로가 담양에서 출발하여 순창-남원-운봉-함양-산음-단성-삼가-의령-함안-창원-김해-동래-부산-동해-대마도를 거쳐 일본 오사카로 향한다고 쓴 그의 격문이 인용되어 있다. 그렇게 보름가량 담양에서 대기하며 추가로 모병하여 병력이 3천에 이르는데, 그때 해남 현감 위대기와 군산만호 이세침이 김덕령의 충용군에 합류하였고, 김덕령의 측근 김응회와 김언욱이 벼슬을 받았다.
1월 22일 김덕령의 충용군은 3천여 명의 전라도 의병을 거느리고 군량미 3천 석을 실은 후 전라도 담양에서 출발하여 순창을 거쳐 남원을 머문다. 남원에 머무는 동안 조방장(助防將) 곽재우의 군대에 합류하여 명령을 받겠다는 서신을 보내었고, 최담령을 별장으로 삼아 한 달 남짓 의병을 훈련 시킨다.
2월초에 조정에서는 분조에서 실시한 전주 무과시험 합격자 등을 김덕령의 충용군에 합류시켜, 충용군은 관군과 의병의 연합부대 성격을 띈다. 충용군은 경상도 함양에 도착하여 도원수 권율 막하에 가서 도착 보고를 하고 일본군을 토벌할 계책을 논의했다. 조정에서는 김덕령에게 진해·고성의 경계에 머물면서 경상도 거제, 진해, 함안 등지에서 노략질하는 일본군을 방어하도록 전교를 내린다.
2월 2일 경상도 산음현(지금의 산청군)의 환아정(換鵝亭)에 본진을 마련한다. 최강(崔堈), 안신갑(安信甲) 등 13명을 임명하였다. 3일에는 함안 부근 남산리(오늘날의 함안군 장지리·사내리 일부)에 도착해 산정에 가시나무 울짱을 두고 진을 치고, 별장들에게 병사를 매복케 하였다.
정탁의 《임진기록》에 따르면, 2월 5일 김덕령 휘하의 별장 최강(1559~1614)이 고성에 나아가 일본군 수백 명과 맞서 싸워 넷을 베고 90여 명을 활로 쏘아 죽였고, 8일에도 최강이 창원에서 일본군과 맞서 싸워 30여 명을 활로 쏘아 죽이고 한 명의 수급을 베었다. 오희문의 《쇄미록》에 따르면, 고성 전투는 3월 22일에 일어난 일이다. 다만 이 두 전공은 최강의 전공이며, 김덕령의 전공으로 보기는 힘들다.
2월 7일 김덕령은 기병 100여 기를 이끌고 창원 성밖 5리쯤 되는 곳에 곧장 들어갔다. 일본군의 위세가 진주성 전투 때와 비슷했으며, 매복하던 일본군 네댓 명이 칼만 휘두르다 후퇴했다. 김덕령이 진영으로 돌아와 염탐하니 일본군은 웅천(熊川)과 김해(金海) 등으로 돌아갔다고 한다. 9일 산음 본진으로 돌아온다. 10일 새벽 권율의 명을 받은 김덕령은 여러 별장을 거느리고 각각 300여 명을 인솔하여 전날 매복했던 곳에서 일본군의 허리를 끊게 했다.
2월 27일 김덕령의 충용군이 산음에 주둔한다. 충용군이 경상도에서 머무른 지 한 달이 되자 군량 부족에 시달린다.
3월 2일에 이르러 김덕령은 조정에 치계(馳啓)한 뒤, 별다른 전투 상황도 없고 군량도 부족함을 들어, 예하 3천여 병력 가운데 호남 군사로 벼슬한 자 5백여 명만 남기고 모두 귀농시켰다. 조정에서도 상황이 심각함을 알고, 위급시만 징병하고 평시에는 둔전을 설치하여 운용토록 한다.
4월 1일(또는 4월 12일) 김덕령 충용군은 산음을 떠나 의령을 거쳐 진주목 동쪽 대곡리(현재는 대곡면 대곡리)로 본진을 옮겼다. 진주 대곡리는 함안과 고성 사이에 있어, 일본군이 서쪽으로 진출할 때 지나야 할 요충지였다. 그곳에서 진해와 고성 지방을 방어하였다. 그해 여름에는 대곡리를 떠나 진주 월아산 아래 대여촌(지금의 진주시 금산면 가방리 관방마을) 들판에도 진을 치고 둔전을 설치한다. 군인들은 식량의 자급자족을 위하여 농사를 지었다. 또한 장기전에 대비하여 진주성을 한눈에 바라볼 수 있는 월아산(月牙山) 정상에 목책을 설치하고 제무소를 만들어 칼과 창 등의 무기도 제조하였다.
한편 《선조실록》 1594년 4월 17일, 18일자 기사에 따르면, 변방의 장수들이 굶주린 우리 백성의 목을 베어 전투에서 얻은 일본군의 목이라고 허위보고를 하고, 대부분의 군대들이 예전에는 명나라 군대에 의지하더니 이제는 김덕령의 충용군에만 의존하여 아예 손을 놓고 있었다. 도원수 권율의 지도력에 대한 문제도 제기되었다.
그 무렵 1594년 4월에 선조는 각도의 모든 의병을 혁파하는 정책을 시행하였는데, 임계영의 전라좌의병, 변사정의 적개의병(敵愾義兵) 그리고 정인홍의 경상도 의병들을 해산하거나 그 일부를 모두 충용군에 소속시키었고, 그에 따라 김덕령은 나이 28세(만26세)에 의병 총대장에 임명되어, 조방장(助防將) 곽재우와 함께 도원수 권율의 막하에서 경상도 서부 지방 방어 임무를 맡았다.
그 뒤에 김덕령과 충용군은 9월 2일 권율 휘하에서 경상도 고성(固城) 지방에서 일본군 2백여 명과 맞서, 김덕령을 비롯한 2백여 명이 매복하여 싸워 단 한 명도 베지 못하였으나, 잡혀가던 사람 50여 명을 남김없이 구하여 데려오는 공을 세운다.
이렇듯 의병장 곽재우 장군과 힘을 합쳐 여러 차례 걸쳐 일본군에 맞서 싸웠으므로 위명이 높아갔다. 김덕령이 의병을 일으킨 시기는 강화교섭기로서 큰 전과는 없었지만, 고성(固城)·창원(昌原) 방어를 통해 일본군이 진주 일원의 지역에 다시는 출현할 수 없도록 하여 결국 전라도를 온전히 보전할 수 있도록 하였다.
한편 9월 21일 선조는 그간의 노고를 치하하여 권율, 이빈, 곽재우 등 육군 수뇌부와 이순신, 원균, 이억기 등 수군 지휘관에게 포상하였고, 김덕령도 호피와 방한복 한 벌을 하사받았다.

장문포 해전
1594년(선조 27년) 9월 말부터 10월 초까지 장문포(場門浦)에서 충무공 이순신, 경상우수사 원균, 육병장(陸兵將) 곽재우 등과 수륙 연합전에 참가한 것을 비롯하여 경상도 진해·고성 지방을 방어하였다.
1594년 8월 6일 장문포 해전에 앞서 조선 수군은 좌의정 윤두수는 삼도 체찰사가 되면서, 도원수 권율, 삼도 수군통제사 이순신 체계를 갖추게 된다. 삼도체찰사 윤두수는 경상우수사 원균의 건의에 따라 수륙합동작전을 비변사에 보고하지만, 비변사에서는 반대하고, 선조는 그 소신이 가상하다고 여겨 허락한다. 육군은 권율, 김덕령, 곽재우, 선거이 등이 나서고 수군은 이순신, 원균 등이 나섰다.
김덕령은 도원수 권율로부터 9월 27일까지 견내량으로 모여 장문포 전투에 참전하라는 명령을 받고, 26일에 8백여 병사를 거느리고 도착한다. 장문포는 현재의 거제시 장목면 장목리에 위치한 포구로서 바로 앞에는 칠천도가 있다. 27일에는 삼도수군통제사 이순신이 경상우수사 원균과 함께 전선 50여 척으로 한산도에서 일제히 출발하여 적도(거제시 문덕면) 앞바다에 이르렀다.
전투에 앞서 김덕령과 곽재우의 대화가 《선조수정실록》에 나오는데, 곽재우와 조정의 기대는 큰데 반해 김덕령은 자신감이 없고 부담스러워 한다.
조경남의 《난중잡록》과 이순신의 《난중일기》에 나타난 장문포 수륙 합동작전이 9월 28일부터 시작한다.
당시 충용장 김덕령은 도원수 권율의 명령에 따라 의령에서 차출된 군사를 이끌고 선봉장으로 장문포 전투에 참전하였으나, 10월에는 각기증에 들어 전투에서 그다지 활약하지 못하였다. 권율의 장계에 따르면, 곽재우를 전군을 지휘하는 도별장으로 삼고, 윤두수의 140여 명과 이일(李鎰)의 210여 명은 육전을 지원하도록 장수를 정하여 출전시키는데, 김덕령이 때마침 각기증을 앓고 있어 말을 타거나 걷는 모습이 쓰러질 듯싶어, 여러 장수는 모두 겁을 먹은데다가 또 거제의 적병이 산야에 깔려 있다는 소식을 듣고는 더욱 의구심을 갖게 되었다고 한다. 병조좌랑 김상준이 전한 김덕령의 병세도 그와 비슷하다.
《난중잡록》과 《연려실기술》의 기록에 따르면, 9월 29일 첫 전투에는 각기증으로 참여하지 못하고 10월 4일의 두 번째 전투에 가까스로 참전하나, 초라한 모습이었다고 한다. 일본군이 성에 올라 대항하매, 선거이가 김덕령에게, 용맹을 보여 달라고 청하나, 배에 타고 익호기(翼虎旗) 두 개를 뱃머리에 꽂고 선봉으로 전진하다가 적의 공세가 거세어 퇴각하였다.
《난중일기》에 따르면, 10월 4일 이순신은 조방장 곽재우·충용장 김덕령과 함께 수륙 합동작전을 협의하고 대대적으로 수륙합동공격을 실시하였다. 김덕령이 군사 수백 명을 이끌고 땅으로 상륙하여 산으로 올라가고 바다에서 수군이 호응하는 작전이나, 별다른 전과 없이 끝났다. 선봉에 선 김덕령 부대가 잠시 일본군을 혼란 시켰으나, 일본군이 높은 위치에서 총을 쏘아대니 공격을 멈출 수 밖에 없었고, 이에 선거이를 포함한 여러 장수들이 모두 퇴각하였다.
조선군은 장문포에서 세 차례나 수륙합동작을 펼치며 일본군을 공격하였으나, 후쿠시마 마사노리[福島正則]가 견고하게 쌓은 성을 철통같이 수비한다. 일본군은 1.6km나 되는 거리에 뗏목을 배치하여 조선 수군의 접근을 막았고, 또한 “일본이 명나라와 더불어 지금 화친을 논의하고 있는 중이니 싸울 필요가 없다.”라는 패문을 써서 땅에 꽂고는 싸우려 하지 않았으므로 별다른 전과를 거두지 못하였고, 결국 10월 7일부터 충청병사 선거이와 조방장 곽재우, 충용장 김덕령 등이 육지의 주둔지로 돌아가는 등 차츰 후퇴했다.
이렇게 장문포 전투에서 수륙합동작전이 실패로 끝나자 작전 실패의 책임을 물어 도체찰사 윤두수가 체직되고, 김덕령도 조정과 여러 사람으로부터 기대를 잃게 되는 결과를 초래하고 만다. 《난중잡록》에 따르면, 장문포 전투에서 좌상 윤두수에게 잘못 보여 훗날 목숨을 잃기에 이르렀다.
그러나 선조는 자신이 허락하여 치른 전투였음을 감안하여 윤두수를 감싼다. 다시 말해 장문포 전투에 대한 장계 문제로 논란이 생기고, 선조가 윤두수를 감쌌으나 결국 체직한다. 경상도 관찰사 홍이상이 11월 19일에 보낸 장계가 조정을 발칵 뒤집는다. 이 장계에는 전라주사(全羅舟師)의 사후선(伺侯船) 3척이 실종되고, 그 배에 탄 군사들이 거의 다 죽은 사실이 적혀 있었다. 10월 1일과 3일의 일부 경과를 서로 숨기고 사실대로 알리지 않고, 도리어 공훈을 보고하였다면서, 사헌부는 11월 22일에 권율·이순신을 잡아들여 신문하고 윤두수를 파직하라고 주청한다. 12월 1일까지 여러 차례 사헌부, 사간원 등에서 돌아가며 상소가 올라왔고, 결국 선조는 전쟁이 진행 중인 상황에서 장수를 바꾸는 일은 병가(兵家)에서 꺼리는 일이라서 권율·이순신은 체직시킬 수 없다고 하면서, 다만 16차례에 걸쳐 탄핵을 당한 윤두수만 체직시키고 이 사건을 마무리한다. 즉, 장문포 해전은 (원균이 처음 입안하고) 윤두수가 장계를 올려 허락을 받고 총책임자가 되었으며, 야전에서 도원수 권율과 통제사 이순신이 전투지휘를 하는 전투였다. 윤두수는 이 전투의 패배와 보고 미비의 책임을 지고 체직되었으나, 전투지휘를 했던 권율과 이순신은 전장의 장수라는 이유로 체직되지 않았다.
한편, 1594년 9월 1일자 《선조수정실록》에도 “김덕령은 신용(神勇)이 있으니 싸우지 않으면 몰라도 싸우기만 하면 반드시 이길 것으로 알았는데, 한 차례 전투에 공이 없자 주변 사람들이 실망하였다”고 적고 있다. 10월 14일자 《선조실록》에서, 심지어 영의정 유성룡은 “김덕령이 병이 있다고 하는데, 일이 성공되지 못할 줄 알고 병을 핑계한 것인지도 모르겠습니다”라고 혹평한다. 도리어 선조가 “덕령이 만일 일이 성공되지 못할 줄 알았다면 의당 대장(大將)에게 힘써 말하여 중지시켰어야 한다. 듣자니 ‘여러 장수들은 덕령이 오지 않자 지팡이 잃은 맹인과도 같았다.’고 하는데, 여러 장관(將官)이 덕령 한 사람이 오지 않았다고 해서 그렇게 낙심을 한단 말인가. 당초 거사할 때 나도 반드시 패할 줄을 알기는 하였으나 적을 토벌하려는 마음은 매우 취할 만하다. 비변사에서는 과히 책망하지 말고 별도로 뒷 일을 잘 수습할 수 있는 계책을 하도록 하라.”라고 두둔한다.
진주에서 주둔한 지 2년이 다 되었건만 전투다운 전투는 하지 못하고 있었고, 명성을 드높일 기회인 장문포 전투에서도 초라한 성과를 거두자, 김덕령에 대한 조정의 신망은 갈수록 추락 일로였으나, 《선조실록》 1595년(선조 28년) 1월 8일과 2월 6일자 기사에 따르면, 선조는 아직도 김덕령을 계속 신임하였다.
10월 13일 장문포 해전을 마친 뒤 권율의 명에 따라 1593년 6월 하순 제2차 진주성 전투에서 순절한 의사들의 원혼을 달래기 위한 제사를 지낸다.
1595년 1월 27일에 선조가 김덕령의 처자에게 식량을 주어 보살피자, 2월 3일 김덕령은 선조에게 사은 상소를 올린다. 한편 그 상소에서 김덕령은 군량 부족을 호소하였고, 조정은 그에 답하여 전라도 담양(潭陽) 등 네 고을에서 그 곡식을 계속 운송하여 군량이 떨어지지 않게 하도록 명하였다.

살인죄와 옥고
1595년(선조 28년) 말까지 김덕령은 진주에 둔전의 설치 등 전쟁에 대비하였지만, 강화의 추진으로 출전 기회가 적었고, 의병 진영에서 장기전의 대비에 따른 피로의 누적으로 군율의 기강 해이되는 사건이 빈발하였다. 그 해이해진 군사 기강을 바로잡으려고 군율을 엄하게 시행하여 도망치는 부하 몇 사람을 붙잡아 처벌하자, 막료와 군사들 사이에서는 불평의 소리가 터져 나왔다. 비변사에 이것이 보고되자 서인과 동인을 막론하고 의병 대장 김덕령에 대한 비난을 쏟아 냈다. 그 뒤 윤근수가 체포하여 투옥할 때 서인은 그를 비난하였으나 동인의 재상들이 그를 옹호하였다. 이에 선조는 김덕령을 석방하였고, 이를 “제1차 김덕령 옥사”라고 부르기도 한다.
1595년 4월에 선조는 해평부원군 윤근수(尹根壽 1537∼1616)를 불러 일본군의 동태, 명나라 군대의 움직임, 그리고 조선군의 동향을 파악하라는 지시를 내린다. 이에 윤근수는 전라도와 경상도 각 지역을 돌아보다가, 진주에서 처음으로 김덕령을 만난다. 송강 정철이 성혼의 친우이고, 김덕령은 성혼의 제자였으며, 윤근수는 정철이 제기한 세자 책봉문제를 지지·찬성하다가 유배를 갔었기 때문에 그동안의 노고를 치하하고 각별한 애정을 표시한다. 그러다 윤근수는 이곳에서 그의 노복이 죄를 지어 문초를 받고 있음을 알고 김덕령에게 선처를 부탁한다.
같은해 9월에 윤근수는 특산물 조달의 현지 조사를 위하여 체방사가 되어 다시 진주를 방문했는데, 그가 석방을 부탁한 노복이 김덕령에게 죽었다는 소식을 듣게 된다. 10월 17일자 윤근수는 분노하여 김덕령을 진주 옥에 가둔다.
김덕령이 첩보 전달을 지체했다는 이유로 역졸 한 사람을 매로 쳐서 죽였다고 알려진 일은 첩보를 전달하는 전령이 제 역할을 못하여 적의 정보파악이 늦어지고 군량 조달에 차질이 빚어져서, 또 그 전령을 잡아서 볼기 몇 대를 쳤는데, 그게 와전되어 돌에 매달아 물속에 넣었다고 김덕령은 모함을 받았다. 김덕령이 약속을 어기고 윤근수의 노속을 죽였다고 알려진 일은 장문포 전투에 참가하기로 했던 병사 최인상·최덕웅 형제가 도망을 가서 그의 아버지 최춘용을 심문하는 과정에서 병사들의 아버지를 매질하였는데, 윤근수의 부탁에 따라 풀어 주었으나, 그 뒤 상처가 악화되어 죽었다. 이렇듯 군율에 따라 장졸을 다스린 김덕령에게 살인죄를 적용함은 지나치다고 진주 출신 부사 성여신과 진주 유생 박흥주 등은 도체찰사 이원익에게 선처를 호소하는 청원서를 보낸다. 김덕령이 경상도에 머무르는 동안 커다란 전공을 세우지는 못하였으나, 지역민들로부터 나쁘지 않는 평가를 받았음은 분명하다.
이듬해인 1596년(선조 29년) 김덕령이 진주옥에 갇힌 지 3개월이 다 된 1월이 되어서야 의금부로 옮겨 국문을 당했으나, 우의정 정탁(鄭琢) 등이 석방을 탄원하는 등 사면을 요청한다. 1월 8일 김덕령이 증거를 들어 스스로 해명하고, 선조도 풀어주라 비변사에 명하였다. 그러나 1월 13일 사헌부에서 김덕령의 처벌을 간하며 아울러 그를 처벌하지 않은 형조 당상·색낭청의 추고를 청하였다. 《선조실록》 1월 14일자 기사에 따르면, 이 두 번째 청까지도 선조는 처벌을 허락하지 않지만, 1월 15일 사헌부가 세 번째 청을 하자 그때야 의금부 압송을 허락한다.
첫 옥살이는 큰 고초를 겪지 않고 지낸 듯하다. 1월 17일 이호민·유성룡 등이 풀어주도록 청한다. 감옥에 갇힌 지 4개월만인 1596년 2월 28일에 선조는 특명으로 김덕령을 풀어주고 그에게 궁중에서 사용하는 내구마(內廐馬) 한 필을 주라고 명한다. 다만 3월 3일 이덕형이 선조에게 김덕령을 만나보라 청하고 선조가 김덕령을 보고 싶다고 오게 하라고 명령을 내렸으나, 3월 1일에 김덕령은 식량이 부족하여 군중으로 내려간 뒤였다. 그때 선조는 입시한 여러 신하에게 일러 평하기를, 대장을 삼기에는 알맞지 않고 돌격 장령(突擊將領)을 시키기에 합당한 자라고 하였다.

이몽학의 난과 압송
1596년(선조 29년) 7월 6일 충청도 홍산(鴻山) 지역에서 왕족 이몽학(李夢鶴)이 난을 일으켰다(→이몽학의 난). 이몽학은 “충용장 김덕령과 의병장 곽재우·홍계남 등이 모두 군대를 연합하여 도우며, 병조 판서 이덕형이 내응한다”라는 등 거짓말과 헛소문을 퍼뜨렸다. 한편 7월 12일에 도원수 권율은 충청병사 이시언의 요청을 받아 전라감사 박홍로와 함께 군사를 거느리고 여산을 거쳐 이산(尼山)으로 향하였다. 도중에 권율은 반란군의 세력이 매우 많음을 알고 충용장 김덕령에게 명령하여 군사를 거느리고 오게 하였다. 그러나 며칠 뒤 부여군 석성(石城)에서 크게 이겨 이몽학의 목을 베어 난을 진압한다.
7월 14일 권율의 명을 받은 김덕령은 난을 진압하려고 진주를 떠나 충청도로 진군하다 15일에 단계에서 유숙했으며 16일에 함양으로 갔다. 17일에 미처 운봉에 닿기 전에 도원수가 다시 전령을 고쳐 반란이 진압되었다고 하였기에, 광주로 돌아가려 했으나 허락받지 못해 진주로 진소(陣所)로 돌아간다.
이몽학이 죽은 뒤 그가 지닌 문서를 보니 김·최·홍의 세 성(姓)이 적혀 있었다. 도원수 권율이 홍주 옥에 갇힌 모속관(募粟官) 한현(韓絢)을 심문하니 그는 “김덕령·최담령·홍계남이다”고 자백하고, “곽재우와 고언백도 모두 나의 심복이었다”라고 자백하였다. 이에 무과에 급제한 정식 장수이면서도 후방에 배치되거나 김덕령의 막하에서 종군함을 불만으로 여기던 충청도 순찰사 이정암의 종사관 신경행(辛景行)이 7월 18일에 김덕령을 체포하라는 장계를 올린다. 그때 충청 병사(忠淸兵使) 이시언(李時言)과 경상 병사(慶尙兵使) 김경서(金景瑞)가 더욱 장군을 꺼려서 시기를 이용해 죽이려고 밀계(密啓)하여 김덕령이 반역할 정황이 있다고 말하고, 영의정 유성룡이 이시언 등의 말에 동조하였다.
그러한 무고가 받아들여져, 선조는 즉시 동부승지 서성(徐渻)을 보내 김덕령을 잡아오도록 하였다. 서성이 전주에 이르니 도원수 권율이 김덕령을 이미 진주 옥에 가두어 놓은 상태였는데, 권율은 김덕령이 명령을 거역할까 염려하여 비밀리에 성윤문(成潤文)에게 시켜 그를 잡아오게 하였다. 성윤문은 김덕령의 억울함을 알기에 두 손만 자물쇠로 채워서 옥에 보냈다. 서성이 장계를 올렸는데, 거기에 四日遲留 觀望成敗(나흘동안 머뭇거리며 성패를 바라보다.) 여덟 글자가 있었는데, 그게 죄목으로 되었기 때문에 서성이 비난을 받았다.
7월 27일에 서성은 김덕령을 전 현감 김경눌 등을 시켜 함거(檻車)에 실어 압송하도록 하여 서울의 옥에 가둔다. 이를 “제2차 김덕령 옥사”라고 부르기도 한다. 다만 김덕령이 국문을 당하고 있는데도 권율이 김덕령에 대해 어떠한 변명도 하지 않았다.
한현이 동조자로 지목한 곽재우, 고언백, 홍계남은 잡혀왔다가 우의정 정탁·김응남 등의 구명·탄원에 노력하여 풀려났고, 반란군의 입에 오르내린 병조판서 이덕형은 40일 동안 거적을 깔고 엎드려 처분을 기다린 끝에 무사하였다. 그러나 오직 김덕령만은 무사하지 못하였다.
8월 4일 선조에게 친히 첫 국문을 받는다.

죽음
1596년(선조 29년) 8월 4일 국문에서 그는 혐의를 승복하지 않고 억울함을 호소하였다. 그 국문에서 김덕령은 선조에서 7월 14일부터 17일까지 있었던 일을 아뢴다. 선조는 그걸 듣더니 사가(私家) 한 칸에 따로 가두게 한다. 1596년 8월 21일까지 선조는 그에게 6회 친국하였다.
첫 추국 뒤 김덕령은 삼엄하게 감시 받는다. 며칠 뒤 8월 8일에 선조는 김덕령의 심복 최담령을 친국한다. 최담령은 전라도 부안에 있는 처자를 만나러 갔다가 잡혀 올라왔다. 이어서 선조는 8월 14일에 전교를 내려서, 최강·김언욱 등 김덕령의 참모들을 지체 없이 추국하여 김덕령 사건을 신속 처리케 한다.
8월 16일부터 추국청은 선조가 친국하는 사이에도 김덕령을 매일 형문한다. 8월 18일 3차, 8월 19일 4차, 8월 20일 5차 친국이 이어진다.
《국조인물고》에 따르면, 친국을 진행하는 도중에 선조가 여러 신하에게 물으니, 행지중추부사(行知中樞府使) 정탁(鄭琢)과 김응남(金應南)은 김덕령이 반역하지 않았다고 답하나, 영의정 유성룡만은 대답이 없다가 다시 물으니, “이 뒤에 만일 어떠한 생각지 않았던 일이 생긴다면 김덕령같이 용맹한 자를 놓아주었다가 다시 잡아들일 수 있을는지는 신이 알지 못하겠습니다.”라고 하였다.
정탁은 증거가 없음을 들어 여러 차례 김덕령을 구명하려 노력하였다. 김덕령의 이름이 반란군의 공초에 많이 나오지 않다는 점을 감안하여 신중한 처리를 주장하였고, 김덕령의 구명을 위한 상소문, 즉 〈김덕령옥사계〉(金德齡獄事啓)를 지었다. 김덕령 자신도 친국에서 “비록 도적들의 한 말이 그와 같을지라도 공모했다면 반드시 오고 간 자취가 있을 것입니다. … 그런데 제가 터무니없는 명성이 있었기 때문에 저 역적의 무리들이 국가에서 저를 쓰지 않도록 하게 하려고 시기하여 모함하는 흉계를 부린 것입니다. 제가 우러러 받드는 군부의 앞에서 분변하지 않는다면 어디에서 발명(發明)하겠습니까?”라며, 그러한 사실이 없음을 주장하였다.
8월 21일 최종 6차 친국에서도, 수차례 고문을 당하여 김덕령은 겨우 목숨만 남아있었으나 행동거지는 평상시와 같았다.
그날 마지막에 이르러 선조가 구명할까 여겨 국문장의 신료에게 물었으나, 살려야 한다는 사람이 없었다.
《선조실록》에 따르면, 류성룡은 김덕령을 살리는 데 소홀했다. “역적들의 공초에 많이 나온 자가 김덕령이어서 마땅히 추문(推問)해야” 하고, “김덕령은 송유진(宋儒眞) 때에 자주 역적들의 공초에 나왔었으나 그때는 사람들이 의심하지 않았습니다. 그런데 이번에 또 한현(韓絢)의 초사(招辭) 속에 나왔으니, 이는 의심할 만한 일입니다.”라고 하였다. 《선조수정실록》에 따르면, 동인인 류성룡은 김덕령에게 죄가 있음이 확실하니 다른 죄인이 다다를 때까지 치죄를 신중히 따져가며 하도록 간했으나, 서인이며 윤근수의 형제인 판중추부사 윤두수는 즉시 엄벌에 처할 것을 주장했다. 또한 류성룡은 살 도리가 없으니, 그의 일당을 국문한 뒤에 처리하기를 바랐고, 놓아주는 일도 반대했다. 훗날 현종대(1668년; 현종 9년)에 그 일을 다시 거론한다. 치대(置對)함에 미쳐서는 근거로 삼을 만한 증거가 없었으므로 선조가 여러 신하들에게 묻자, 류성룡이 “이치상 반드시 살려둘 수 없다.”라고 말했음을 밝히고 있다. 이처럼 다른 기록에서도 류성룡은 ‘상황이 이러하니 살게 될 수는 없다’라는 전제(前題)를 말하면서 김덕령의 억울함에 대해서는 일체 말하지 않음으로써 훗날 두고두고 “유성룡이 김덕령을 죽이게 하였다” 또는 “유성룡이 김덕령을 구명하지 않고 방치하였다”라는 말이 나오게 될 빌미를 제공하였다.
몇몇 신료는 살인을 많이 하였으니 죽어 마땅하고 애석할 일도 없다고 밝혔다. 심지어 정언 김택룡(金澤龍)은 심지어 국가가 차츰 편안해지는데 장수 하나쯤 죽여도 괜찮으니 죽여서 후환을 없애야 한다고 말했다.
최후까지 김덕령은 자복(自服)하지 않다가 “충효로써 죽음을 삼은 죄밖에 없습니다”라는 말과 “다만 최담령 등이 죄 없이 옥에 갇혀 있으니 원컨대 죽이지 마시옵소서”라는 부탁을 남긴 채 죽으니, 향년 30세였다.
선조가 김덕령을 국문하는 태도에 대해 《선조실록》을 바탕으로 선조의 의지가 강해서 아무도 반대하지 않았다고 평가하기도 하나, 정탁과 김응회 등의 구명노력이나 《선조실록》·《선조수정실록》에 나타난 신료의 태도가 선조보다 더 심했던 바로 보건대, 선조보다는 신료의 의지가 더 강해서 죽게 되었다고도 볼 수 있다.

사후
김덕령의 시신은 온전히 거두어져 수레에 실려 광주 석저촌에 도착한다. 역적 이몽학과 한현의 시신이 저잣거리에 걸리고 능지처참을 당한 것에 비하여 대접을 받은 셈이다. 시신에는 부인 이씨가 손수 만든 수의가 입혀지고, 장례식은 암울하게 치러진다. 역적으로 몰렸으니 조정에서 보낸 관리가 장례를 삼엄하게 통제하였다. 김덕령은 무등산 자락에 묻힌다.
그의 작품 중 죽기 전에 지었다는 시조(詩調)인 〈춘산곡〉(春山曲)이 전한다.
부인 이씨는 자식도 없이 홀로 지내다가 1597년 정유재란 때 담양 추월산으로 피난을 간다. 일본군은 이곳까지 추격하여 백성들을 닥치는 대로 죽이고 부녀자를 겁탈하였다. 그녀는 정절을 지키려다가 보리암 근처 낭떠러지에서 떨어져 순절한다.
김덕령의 동생 김덕보는 세상이 싫어 은거하였다. 여러 곳을 떠돌다 고향에 돌아와 무등산 원효계곡 아래 집을 짓고 은거하고 죽을 때까지 지내는데, 그 집이 바로 풍암정(楓巖亭)이다. 뒷날 1627년 정묘호란이 일어나자 김덕보는 안방준(安邦俊)과 함께 의병을 일으켰으나 나이가 많고 병이 들어 전장에는 나가지 못하였고, 그해 11월 28일 한 많은 세상을 뜬다. 안방준은 김덕령의 원통한 사연을 김덕보에게서 듣고 〈삼원기사〉(三寃記事)를 썼다.
친아들 김광옥(金光沃)은 외가가 있던 전라도 익산군 용안면(현 익산시 용안면)에 숨어살며 본관(本貫)을 용안(龍安)으로 바꾸고 신분을 감추며 살았다. 그 뒤 김광옥은 그의 외삼촌인 이인경(李寅卿)의 부임지인 평안북도 안주군 운곡면 쇠꼴이(숙천군 근처)로 이주하여 후손을 이어간다.
한편 김덕령의 죽음을 들은 일본군은 기쁜 얼굴로 서로 치하하였다. 남도(南道)의 군민(軍民)들은 항상 그에게 기대고 그를 소중하게 여겼는데 억울하게 죽게 되자 소문을 들은 자 모두 원통하게 여기고 가슴 아파하였다. 그때부터 남쪽 사민(士民)들은 덕령의 일을 경계하여 용력(勇力)이 있는 자는 모두 숨어버리고 다시는 의병을 일으키지 않았다. 김덕령이 청원한 대로 별장 최담령(崔聃齡)·최강(崔堈)을 사면하여 덕령이 모집한 군사를 거느리고 양남(兩南)의 방어사에게 나누어 배속시켰다. 최담령은 덕령과 함께 용력의 명성을 나란히 하였는데, 이 뒤로부터는 어리석은 겁보인 체하여 스스로 폐인 노릇을 하였다. 덕령의 매부 이인경(李寅卿)도 담략과 용기가 있고 술수(術數)를 알았는데 무과를 거쳐 일본군 토벌에 공을 세웠지만 덕령이 화를 입게 되자 이를 경계하여 벼슬이 변방 군수에 이르렀을 때 즉시 병을 칭탁하여 사임하고는 생을 마칠 때까지 감히 큰 장령(將領)이 될 생각을 하지 않았다.
김덕령이 죽은 지 1년 뒤 김덕령의 억울함을 상소함으로써 호소한 사람은 전라도 관찰사로서 김덕령을 의병장으로 추천한 이정암이었다. 그는 정유재란(丁酉再亂) 때 해서초토사(海西招討使)로 있던 1597년(선조 30년) 10월 상소문을 통해 김덕령의 억울함을 선조에게 호소하였다.

추존
1661년(현종 2년) 8월 30일 현종이 한재(旱災) 때문에 도신(道臣)에게 명하여 신설(伸雪)되지 않은 자들을 알아내 계문(啓聞)하도록 하였는데, 반고(盤皐) 김시진(金始振)이 김덕령을 아뢰자, 특명으로 신원(伸寃)하여 관작을 복원해주었다.
1668년(현종 9년) 4월 13일 교리(校理) 이단하(李端夏)가 요청하여 김인후ㆍ강항ㆍ김덕령을 추증하였는데, 정6품 좌랑 김덕령(金德齡)을 정3품 병조참의(兵曹參議)로서 당상관에 증직(贈職)하고 시호를 내렸다. 이 무렵 나주목사 이민서(李敏敍)가 구전되는 자료를 모아 《김장군전》(金將軍傳)을 지었다.
1677년(숙종 3년)에 광주목사가 된 이민서는 임진왜란 때의 의병장 박광옥(朴光玉)의 사우 벽진서원을 중수하고, 1678년(숙종 4년) 지방 사림들의 뜻을 모아 김덕령을 벽진서원에 제향하였다.
1680년(숙종 6년) 윤8월 24일 김덕령이 의병을 일으킨 일에 대해 이민서가 청액상소를 올려 박광옥(朴光玉)ㆍ김덕령을 배향한 사원에 “의열(義烈)”이라는 사액을 받게 하였고, 김덕령은 특별히 정2품 병조판서에 증직하였다.
1694년(숙종 20년) 왕명으로 이민서가 《김덕령유사》를 편찬하였다.
1710년(숙종 36년)에 김덕보의 아들 김거(金璩)의 손자이자 봉사손(奉祀孫)인 김수신(金守信)이 녹용(錄用)되어 음직으로 전설사 별검(別檢)과 북부도사(北部都事)를 지냈다.
1785년(정조 9년) 9월 5일 전라도 유생 기석주(奇錫周)가 상소를 올리자 정조는 포장(褒奬)하여 증직하는 일도 지나치지 않다고 답한다. 그 뒤 정2품 증 병조판서 김덕령에게 충장(忠壯)의 시호가 내려졌고, 부인 이씨에게 종1품 정경부인을 추증하였고, 형 덕홍에게 증 지평(持平) 벼슬을, 아우 덕보에게 증 집의(執儀) 벼슬을 더해, 삼형제를 의열사에 함께 모시게 하였다. 충장이란 뜻은 ‘위태롭게 하여 임금을 받들었기에 충이라 하고, 무에 능하고 몸가짐이 진중하기에 장’이라 하였다.
1786년(정조 10년) 1월 25일 평안도 도사(都事) 김치광(金致光)이 김덕령의 후손임이 알려지자, 정조는 유공자 후손의 특전을 베풀어 빈자리가 나거든 다시 내직에 의망(擬望)하게 했다. 이때 의망은 삼망(三望)의 후보자로 추천하던 일인데, 삼망은 벼슬아치를 발탁할 때 후보자 셋을 추천하던 일이다. 즉, 빈자리가 난 내직의 후보자 3인 가운데 한 사람으로 추천하는 것으로, 벼슬자리를 주는 게 아니라 그 기회를 남들보다 더 많이 준다는 뜻이다.
1788년(정조 12년) 11월 16일 지방관으로 하여금 그 마을에 ‘증 병조판서 충장공 김덕령 증 정경부인 흥양이씨 충효지리(贈兵曹判書忠壯公金德齡贈貞敬夫人興陽李氏忠孝之里)’라는 비석(충장공 정려비)을 세우게 명하였고, 이듬해 1789년 3월 그 비가 세워졌다. 1792년에 처음 세워진 비각은 정면 3칸 측면 1칸의 맞배지붕으로 지어졌다.
1789년(정조 13년) 1월 11일 김덕령 부인의 직함(職啣)은 종1품 정경부인(貞敬夫人)이고, 김덕령의 증직은 정2품 자헌대부(資憲大夫) 병조판서로 서로 어긋남을 이조판서 이갑(李𡊠)이 아뢰자, 그 청대로 자급(資級)을 종1품 의정부 좌찬성에 추증토록 하비(下批)하였고, 김덕령 형제가 자란 마을에 이미 생계(牲繫)를 오두(烏頭)로 바꾸도록 명하였다.
1789년(정조 13년) 4월 6일 김덕령의 제사를 영구히 지내고 절대로 신주를 옮기지 말라는 부조특명(不祧特命)을 내렸다. 조정의 명령으로써 방손 한 사람을 선택하여 공의 제사를 받들어 대대로 끊어지지 않도록 하였는데, 그 사람은 김덕보의 아들 김거(金璩)의 6세손 김치옥(金致玉)(또는 7세손 김홍기(金洪基))이다.
1791년(정조 15년) 숙종대에 왕명으로 간행했던 《김덕령유사》를 왕명으로 다시 간행하매, 서용보(徐龍輔)에게 편집하여 목판본을 남기게 하였다.
김덕령을 모시던 광주 의열사는 1868년 흥선대원군의 서원철폐령으로 헐린 뒤 복원되지 못한 채 지내다가 1971년 각지의 유지들이 뜻을 모아‘충장공 김덕령장군사우 복원사업추진위원회’가 구성되면서 빛을 보게 되었고, 박정희 대통령의 특별지원 등 정부의 지원을 받아 광주 충효동에 자리를 잡고 1974년 11월 김덕령과 가족의 묘를 이장하고 1975년 2월 가족묘 앞에 충장사(忠壯祠)가 건립되었다.

평가
묵재 이귀(李貴) 등은 용맹이 절륜하고 지혜가 뛰어나다고 평했다.
《임진기록》에서 김덕령이 올린 1594년 5월 11일자 장계에 따르면, “신은 그저 비장(裨將)으로서 선봉에 서서 돌격대의 임무를 맡았을 뿐인데, 이 고개를 넘은 직후 비로소 군에서의 명성을 떨치게 되었습니다.”라고 스스로 평하였다. 앞서 3월 2일 장계에서도 “신이 처음 일을 시작할 때는 동지 몇 명을 불러모아 한 장수의 선봉이 되고자 하였을 뿐인데 뜻밖에 상께서 장수의 호칭을 내려 주시고 모여 있는 군사를 위무(慰撫)해 주시니 신이 감당할 수 없어 밤낮으로 두렵고 민망합니다.”라며 비슷하게 자평하였다.
《서하집》권5에 따르면, 김덕령의 성품에 대해서는 다음과 같이 전한다. 일찍부터 자부심이 강하고 비분강개하는 기질을 가졌으며, 풍모는 그다지 장대(長大)하지는 않았으나, 용맹이 아주 뛰어나고 날렵하였다. 속으로 큰 뜻을 품고 있었으나, 겉으로 드러내지 않아서 사람들 가운데 이를 아는 자가 드물었다.
《국조인물고》에 따르면, 김덕령이 군사를 일으키고 4년이 되도록 공을 세우지 못한 까닭은 밖으로는 김덕령의 위명이 너무 성하여 가는 곳마다 일본군이 군병을 거두어 먼저 피해버렸고, 안으로는 김덕령을 꺼리고 미워하여 해치려는 사람이 많았으며, 의(和議)와 당화(黨禍)도 그 사이에 끼어 들었으니, 공을 이루지 못하고 무함을 받아 죽게 되었다.
무고에 의한 1차 옥사 때 김덕령이 하옥·압송되자, 진주의 유생들이 김덕령을 옹호하고 그의 방면을 청하는 글을 도체찰사 이원익과 조정에 올렸다. 이로써 김덕령이 경상도에 머무르는 동안 커다란 전공을 세우지는 못하였으나 지역민들로부터 나쁘지 않는 평가를 받았다는 것은 분명하다.
《호남절의록》과 〈삼원기사〉(三寃記事) 등에서는 김덕령의 죽음을 중국 남송의 장군 악비(岳飛)의 죽음에 비유한다. 악비가 모함으로 죽었듯이, 김덕령도 이몽학의 난에 연루되어 선조의 의심과 충청병사 이시언·경상우병사 김응서 무리의 시기 때문에 죽었다고 밝힌다.
《난중잡록》 1596년 8월 24일자에서 김덕령의 죽음을 “당시에 뜻있는 이는 개탄하지 않는 이가 없었다.”라고 애도하였다.
현종조에 추증을 논의하였는데, 마땅한 전공이 없었다고 밝히고 있다. 선조가 좌랑 벼슬을 내리고 군호를 내리니, 온 나라 사람들이 고무되어 신장(神將)이라고 하였으며, 일본인들도 듣고서는 두려워하였다. 그러나 적과 대치한 3년 동안에 끝내 적의 목을 벤 공이 없었으며, 성질 또한 술주정이 심하고 사람 죽이기를 좋아하였다고 평한다.
1747년(영조 23년) 영조 대에 호남지역 양전사(量田使)인 원경하(元景夏. 1698~1761)가 호남의 형편에 대하여 임금에게 올린 상소문에서 김덕령을 호남의 10대 인물로 보아 그 용기를 특히 높게 평가한다.

전공
1592년(선조 25년) 8월부터 명나라의 심유경(沈惟敬)과 일본의 고니시 유키나가[小西行長] 사이에 강화 회담이 시작되어, 1593년(선조 26년) 6월 강화 조약이 성립되었다. 일본군에게 사로잡혔던 임해군(臨海君)·순화군(順和君) 두 왕자가 송환된 후 그 뒤 4년 이상 전쟁이 소강상태에 들어가며 그다지 큰 전투가 없었다. 그러다가 1596년(선조 28) 9월 강화 조약이 깨져 다시 전투가 벌어졌으나, 1598년(선조 31년) 8월 일본의 관백 도요토미 히데요시가 죽으면서 그의 유언에 따라서 일본군이 철수하며 7년 전쟁도 끝이 났다.
김덕령은 전라도 의병을 거느리고 담양을 출발한 1594년(선조 27년) 1월 22일부터 옥중에서 사망한 1596년 8월 21일까지의 2년 7개월간으로, 명나라와 일본 사이에 강화 조약이 성립되면서 전쟁이 소강상태에 있을 때였다. 김덕령이 처가가 있던 담양에서 의병 3천여 명을 모집하여 전라도 의병을 거느리고 진주로 간 까닭은 진주성 전투와 관련이 있었다. 제2차 진주성 전투에서 진주성 안에 있던 군관민(軍官民) 5만여 명이 옥쇄(玉碎)하였다. 이에 전라도의 의병을 경상도 진주로 보내어 경상도 관군과 의병의 사기를 진작할 필요가 있었으므로, 비변사에서는 의병 대장 김덕령에게 전라도 의병을 거느리고 진주로 가서 주둔하게 하였다. 또한 나이 28세의 김덕령은 전국 의병 5천여 명을 거느리는 의병 총대장에 임명되어, 조방장 곽재우와 함께 도원수 권율의 막하에서 경상도 서부 지방의 방어 책임을 맡았다. 이후 강화 조약이 성립되면서 전투 상황도 거의 종결되었고, 군량미가 부족해지자 비변사에서는 김덕령에게 의병 숫자를 줄이도록 명하였다. 또 후퇴하는 일본군과 아무쪼록 충돌을 피하기 위하여 무익한 전쟁을 벌이지 말라고 명하였다.
그러므로 실제적인 전공은 극히 드물다. 1594년 9월 2일 충용군은 권율 휘하에서 경상도 고성(固城) 지방에서 일본군 2백여 명과 맞서, 김덕룡을 비롯한 2백여 명이 매복하여 싸워 단 한 명도 베지 못하였으나, 잡혀가던 사람 50여 명을 남김없이 구하여 데려오는 공을 세운다. 이것이 《조선왕조실록》에 기록된 유일한 전공이다. 다만 뚜렷한 전공 기록은 없어도 경상도로 넘어가 진해, 고성 방면을 방어했다는 기록도 있고, 정탁의 《임진기록》에 따르면, 2월 5일 김덕령 휘하의 별장 최강(1559~1614)이 고성에 나아가 일본군 수백 명과 맞서 싸워 넷을 베고 90여 명을 활로 쏘아 죽였고, 8일에도 창원에서 최강이 맞서 싸워 30여 명을 활로 쏘아 죽이고 한 명의 수급을 베었다. 오희문의 《쇄미록》에 따르면, 고성 전투는 3월 22일에 일어난 일이다. 다만 이 두 전공은 김덕령의 전공으로 보기는 힘들다.
1661년 현종 대에 김덕령을 신원할 때도 그 평가에서 전공을 거론하지 않고, 큰 절조를 지니고 용기와 힘을 지녔으며 위엄의 명성을 널리 떨쳤다고 밝힌다. 이는 원경하의 상소에서도 그의 용기를 높이 사서 호남의 10대 인물로 꼽고 있을 뿐, 임진란 때의 전공을 거론하지는 않았다.
한편 전공이 부족함에도 꾸준히 절조나 용기가 거론되는 이유는, 당시 의병 조직은 조선 상황이나 김덕령 개인 사정으로 볼 때 모두 빼어난 용기 없이는 하기 힘든 일이었기 때문으로 여겨진다. 제2차 진주성 전투로 말미암아 진주성에서 방어하던 군사나 그곳에 거주하던 조선인 상당수 살해당했고, 그로 말미암아 조선 정부는 경상도 서부를 방어할 거점을 잃게 되었다. 게다가 김덕령의 형 김덕홍이 제1차 금산전투에서 고바야카와 다카카게[小早隆景]의 일본군을 맞아 싸우다가 고경명과 함께 전사하였다. 이런 상황에서 의병을 일으켰으니, 그 용기를 칭찬할 만하다는 뜻으로 보인다.
다만 김덕령의 용력(勇力)을 두려워한 일본군들은 김덕령이 압송된 것을 보고, 뒤이어 옥사했다는 소식을 듣고 크게 기뻐했다는 데에서 그의 존재만으로도 일본군의 발호를 억제하는 효과가 있었음을 알 수 있다.

선조실록
《선조실록》과 《선조수정실록》에는 여러 차례 평하는 글이 실려 있다.
1594년 9월 1일자 《선조수정실록》에도 “김덕령은 신용(神勇)이 있으니 싸우지 않으면 몰라도 싸우기만 하면 반드시 이길 것으로 알았는데, 한 차례 전투에 공이 없자 주변 사람들이 실망하였다”라고 적고 있다.
1595년(선조 28년) 2월 김덕령은 선조가 자신의 처자에게 식량을 주어 보살핀 일에 대해 선조에게 고맙게 여기어 상소하였다. 그 상소에서, 자신은 조그마한 공조차 없고, 이름만 널리 알려졌다고 스스로 평가했다. “이미 친상(親喪)에 능히 효성을 다하지도 못하였고 일과 마음이 서로 어긋나서 또 적을 치는 데 목숨을 바치지도 못하였으니, 나아가나 물러가나 의거할 바 없어 충효가 모두 결여되었습니다.”
1596년(선조 29년) 2월 19일, 선조가 살인죄로 옥사에 갇힌 김덕령이 어떤 성품인지 권율 등에게 물었다. 권율은 김덕령이 본래 광주(光州)의 교생(校生)으로 용력이 뛰어나 쓸 만한 인재이며, 군율을 너무 엄격히 하여 점차 사람이 멀리하였다고 말하였다. 김응남(金應南)은 살인은 중죄라 아랫사람으로서 임금께 감히 전제할 수 없으나, 덕령은 힘이 남보다 뛰어난 사람임을 남들이 모두 아는 바이고, 특명으로 은혜를 베풀면 힘을 다해 보답하기를 도모한다고 말하였다.
1596년 김덕령을 풀어주며, 선조가 그를 평하기를, 대장을 삼기에는 알맞지 않고 돌격 장령(突擊將領)을 시키기에 합당한 자라고 하였다. 즉, 용맹하나 지휘력이나 통솔력은 부족하였다.
1596년(선조 29년) 이몽학의 난에 연루되어 그를 잡으려 할 때, 김덕령의 용력이 매우 뛰어나서 그가 체포에 응하지 않을까 근심하여 여러 가지로 방략(方略)을 만들어서 그의 도망을 미리 방지하였다. 그러나 김덕령은 스스로 순순히 체포되어 하옥되다. 갑자기 유명해진 까닭에 이시언(李時言) 등의 시기를 받았으며 조정 또한 그의 날쌔고 사나움을 제어하기 어려울지 모른다고 의심하였으므로 기회를 타서 그를 제거하려고 많은 사람들이 그를 놓아주는 것은 옳지 않다고 말하였다.
그해 8월에 역모에 연루되어 국문을 당하는 와중에도 스스로 공이 없고 허명만 가졌음을 밝혔다. 한편 능력이 뛰어난 최담령을 천거하기까지 한다. “여러 해 동안 종군하였지만 아직 조그만 공도 세우지 못해서 충성도 펴보지 못하고 도리어 불효만 하였습니다. 죄가 이에 이르렀으니 만 번 죽어도 죄를 면하기 어렵습니다.”

〈춘산곡〉
죄가 없음을 호소하였으나 받아들여지지 않았고, 죽음을 직감한 김덕령은 ‘춘산에 불이 나니’라고 시작하는 시조 〈춘산곡〉을 지어 자신의 마음을 표현한다.

이 노래는 억울한 누명을 내(연기)없는 불에 비유해, 산불은 끌 수 있으나 자기의 몸속에 붙어 타오르고 있는 억울한 마음의 불은 끌 수 없음을 비유하여 한탄하는 의기가라 하겠다.

이장
사후에 신원되고 난 뒤에도 역적죄가 있던 터라 문중의 무덤이 모여 있는 곳에서 멀리 떨어져 묻혀 있었는데, 1965년에야 광산 김씨의 무덤이 모여 있는 광주 무등산 이치(梨峙)로 묘가 옮겨지게 되었다. 밤중에 묘를 이장하던 중 김덕령의 관을 여니 생시와 다름없이 살이 썩지 않고 있어, 이를 본 사람들은 김덕령의 한이 서린 것이라 하여, 광주에서 사진기를 가져와 모습을 남기려 하였으나, 사진기가 흔치 않던 터라, 사진기를 무덤까지 가져와 보니 시신은 이미 검게 변해 있었다고 한다. 하지만 김덕령이 입고 있던 옷이나 철릭 등은 그대로 보존되어 있어, 현재 광주광역시 무등산에 있는 충장사에 전시되고 있다.

설화
체구가 작지만 날래고 민첩하며 신용(神勇)이 있어, 용력에 대한 전설적인 이야기가 많다.
조선 중기의 명장 김덕령에 관한 설화. 뛰어난 능력을 발휘해 보지도 못하고 억울하게 죽음을 당한 김덕령을 주인공으로 하는 인물전설이다. 문헌설화는 《연려실기술》·《동야휘집》·《풍암집화》·《대동기문》 등에 전하며, 구전설화는 전국적으로 널리 분포되어 있다.
스승인 성혼 문하에서 김덕령과 함께 배운, 묵재 이귀(李貴)는 김덕령의 양편 겨드랑이에 호랑이 2마리가 출입한다는 이야기를 지어내기도 했다.
《국조인물고》 등에 다양한 일화가 실려 있다. 두어 길 되는 칼을 즐겨 써서 술기운이 있을 때면 말에 올라 산비탈을 달려 지나가면서 칼을 좌우로 휘둘러서 자르고 달리니, 지나는 곳마다 큰 소나무가 어지럽게 쓰러져 마치 폭풍우가 지나간 듯하였다. 또 항상 한 쌍의 철퇴(鐵槌)를 차고 다니면서 좌우로 휘둘렀는데, 그 무게가 각각 1백 근이나 되었다. 더러는 말을 달려 방문 안으로 들어갔다가 몸을 날려 말을 거꾸로 타고 나오기도 하였으며, 때로는 지붕에 올라가서 몸을 옆으로 하고 굴러 처마에서 떨어져서 땅에 닿기 전에 몸의 자세를 바꾸어 방으로 뛰어들기도 하였다. 일찍이 맹호가 대밭 속에 있으면서 나오지 않자 장군이 먼저 활을 쏘아 화를 돋구니 호랑이가 놀라고 성이 나서 입을 딱 벌리고 사람을 삼킬 듯이 하므로, 장군이 창을 빼어들고 맞아 찌르니 그 자리에서 즉사하는데, 이러한 일들은 매우 많았다.

씨름
김덕령이 너무 씨름에 빠져 있자 하루는 그의 누나가 그의 버릇을 고쳐주기 위해 남장을 하고 씨름판에 나섰다. 그의 누나는 마지막 판에 나섰고, 그 누나는 덕령의 특기인 ‘반들음’을 피해 그를 번쩍 들어 올려 그대로 땅에 내리꽂았다. 덕령은 씨름에서 처음 진 뒤 씨름판을 찾지 않고 학문과 무술 익히기에 전념했다.

논에 물 대기
덕령이 여남은 살 되던 해 여름, 외갓집에 갔을 때의 일이다. 날이 가물어 사방에서 논에 물을 대느라 물싸움이 자주 일어나곤 했다. 외갓집에서 물을 댈 차례인데, 이를 무시하고 힘깨나 쓰는 사람이 자기 논으로 물고를 돌려놔 버렸고, 이내 싸움이 붙었고, 김덕령이 싸움을 말리려 하자 그는 어린놈이 어른 일에 끼어든다며 괭이로 내리치려 했다. 덕령은 날쌔게 피하며 괭이를 빼앗아 엿가락 늘리듯 늘려서 그의 손에 감아 땅에다 꽉 박아 버렸다. 비록 나이는 어렸지만 불의를 보면 물러서지 않았고 힘 또한 어른을 능가했다.

사나운 말
《김덕령전》에 따르면, 1594년 무렵 진주 둔전에서 사나운 말이 뛰쳐나가 곡식을 밟고 날듯이 높이 뛰어 사람들이 도저히 붙잡을 수 없었는데, 김덕령이 그 소문을 듣고 즉시 가서 굴레를 씌워 올라타니 곧바로 말이 온순하여졌다. 김덕령은 그 백마를 타고 싸움터에서 일본군과 번번이 싸워서 이겼으므로, 일본군은 김덕령을 ‘백마장군’이라고 불렀다. 그 말은 김덕령이 옥고를 치르기 전에 아무것도 먹지를 않아서 김덕령에게 화가 닥칠 것을 미리 알려주었다.
《해동명신록》에는 일본군들은 이 소문을 듣고 몹시 두려워하여 ‘석저장군(石底將軍)’이라고 하였다. 석저는 김덕령이 살던 마을 이름인 석저촌인데, 일본군은 돌 밑에서 나온 줄로 잘못 알고 그렇게 불렀다.

호랑이
김덕령이 연달아 호랑이 두 마리를 때려잡은 일이 있다. 그는 이 호랑이들을 일본군의 병영에 자랑하며 팔았다. 일본군은 김덕령의 신력에 벌벌 떨었다. 일찍이 철퇴 두 개를 허리 아래 좌우에 차고 다녀 신장이라고 불린 김덕령다운 일이다.

체포된 일
이몽학의 난에 연루되어 체포되던 때의 일로, 《국조인물고》에 실려 있다.
처음 장군을 체포할 때에 조정에서는 장군이 명령에 따르지 않을까 의심하여 수신(帥臣)에게 드러나지 않게 불러 영내(營內)에 들어오면 포박하게 하자, 승지 서성(徐渻)이 말하기를, “김덕령은 반역할 사람이 아닙니다. 사자(使者) 한 사람만 보내서 잡아오게 하면 될 것을 구태여 사계(詐計)까지 쓸 것이 무엇이겠습니까?” 하니, 임금께서 서성이 말을 쉽게 하는 것을 의아스레 여겨 성을 내어 말하기를, “네가 가서 잡아오너라.” 하였는데, 서성이 도착하니 이미 진주옥(晉州獄)에 갇혀 있었다. 장군이 도착하자 조정에서는 더욱 의심하여 철쇄(鐵鎖)로 묶고 큰 나무를 끼웠는데, 장군이 웃으면서 말하기를, “내가 만일 반역하려고 한다면 이따위로 어찌 나를 금족(禁足)할 수 있겠습니까?” 하고 몸에 불끈 힘을 주니 철쇄가 모두 끊어졌다.

서석산 전설
처음 거병할 때의 일로, 《국조인물고》에 실려 있다.
처음 장군이 기병(起兵)할 때에 서석산(瑞石山) 골짜기에서 큰칼을 만들었는데, 칼이 만들어지자 산에서 우레와 같은 소리가 울리고 흰 기운이 산골짜기에서 하늘까지 뻗치어 며칠간을 사라지지 않았다. 그 고을에는 옛 고려 명장 정지(鄭地)의 무덤이 있으며, 자손이 대대로 정지의 철의(鐵衣)를 간수하고 있었는데, 장군이 그 철의를 입고서 칼을 차고 정지의 묘소에 가서 제사를 올리는데, 그때 차고 있던 칼이 저절로 풀려 땅에 떨어지기를 세 번이나 하니 사람들이 모두 괴이히 여기고 상서롭지 못하다고 하였다.

정암진 전투 전설
1594년 11월에 김덕령은 의령 정암에서 곽재우 군사와 합동작전을 벌여 승리를 거두었다는 기록이, 1694년(숙종 20년) 숙종의 명에 따라 편찬하고 정조의 명으로 간행한(1791년; 정조 15년) 《김충장공유사》에 나온다. 자료에 따라서는 1595년(선조 28년) 3월에 전투를 치렀다고 나온다. 정암진 전투는 1592년 음력 5월 24일에 벌어졌으므로, 1594년과 1595년의 일이라는 기록은 전설이라 보아야 한다.
김덕령이 군사를 이끌고 의령에 도착하여 곽재우와 함께 정암에 진을 쳤다. 바위 아래에는 크고 깊은 웅덩이가 있는 데 가히 그 깊이를 헤아릴 수 없었다. 일본군이 돌연 표목을 강 상류 얕은 개울에 세웠다. 김덕령이 곽재우에게 “적이 무엇 하고자 하는 것입니까?”라고 물으니 곽재우는 “왜적은 밤을 타 냇가를 건너와 우리를 치려고 표목을 세워 깊은 곳을 피하고자 하는 것입니다”고 하였다.
이 말을 듣자 김덕령은 병사를 이끌고 내를 건너 매복을 하였다. 그리고 일본군이 설치한 표목을 뽑아 깊은 웅덩이에 옮겨 꽂았다. 과연 밤에 일본군이 내를 건넜다. 김덕령이 뒤를 밟아 고함을 지르고 북을 치며 뒤를 쫓으니, 적은 표목만을 바라보고 건너다가 다 빠져 죽고 말았다.

가족 관계
조선 태종(太宗) 때 의정부 찬성(贊成)을 지내었고, 양녕대군 장인인 김한로(金漢老)의 12대손이 김덕령이다.
김함은 광산 김씨 김문손(金文孫)의 아들이다. 김문손은 김후(金詡)와 김함 두 아들을 두었다. 김후의 장녀 김윤덕은 양산보의 부인이 되었고, 둘째 아들이 김윤제다. 양산보의 서자 양자호가 김윤제의 3남 김윤충의 사위가 됨으로써 김·양 두 집안은 겹사돈 관계를 맺었다.
김함의 차녀는 고경명의 장인 김백균(金百鈞, 1525~1584)에게 출가했고, 김함의 손자가 바로 김성원(金成遠)이다. 김윤제는 양산보의 처남, 송순의 고모는 양산보의 어머니, 양산보의 4종매는 임억령의 부인, 임억령의 둘째 딸은 김성원의 부인, 김성원은 정철의 처외재당숙, 정철은 김윤제의 외손녀사위, 양산보의 2남 양자징(梁子澂)은 김인후의 사위, 고경명은 김윤제의 종생질녀(從甥姪女) 사위였다.
김덕령(金德齡, 1568~1596) 의병장은 김문손의 4대손이다. 김성원의 식영정(息影亭)과 서하당(棲霞堂), 양산보(梁山甫)의 소쇄원(瀟灑苑), 김윤제(金允悌)의 환벽당(環碧堂), 정철(鄭澈)의 송강정, 송순(宋純) 면앙정(俛仰亭)의 주인들은 서로 혈맥(血脈)과 혼맥(婚脈)으로 맺어져 있다.

생애
출생
금관국을 세운 수로왕의 12대 손이라고 언급된다. 금관국의 마지막 왕 구형왕이 법흥왕 19년(532년) 세 명의 아들을 거느리고 신라에 항복했으며, 그의 세 아들 중 막내인 김무력이 신라의 신주군주(新州軍主)로 진흥왕 개국(開國) 4년(554년) 관산성 전투에서 백제의 성명왕(聖明王)을 체포해 죽이는 공을 세웠다. 김무력의 장남이었던 아버지 김서현은 대량주도독(大梁州都督)을 지냈다. 어머니 만명은 진흥왕의 아우인 숙흘종의 딸이다. 
김유신열전에는 김서현이 길에서 만명을 보고 눈짓으로 꾀어서 마침내 서로 야합을 하게 되었는데, 서현이 만노군(萬奴郡)의 태수로 전출되면서 만명도 함께 데려가려 했다. 그러나 서현과 만명이 서로 야합한 것을 알게 된 숙흘종은 분노하여 딸을 별채에 가두고 사람들에게 지키게 했다. 그런데 그날 밤, 난데없는 벼락이 쳐서 별채를 지키던 사람들이 놀라 정신없는 틈을 타서 만명은 창문으로 도망쳐 서현과 함께 만노군으로 떠났다고 한다.
유신은 진평왕 건복 12년(595년)에 아버지 서현의 부임지인 만노군에서 태어났는데, 어머니가 그를 갖고 스무 달이 지나서 태어났다고 전한다. 서현은 경진일 밤에 형혹성과 진성 두 별이 자신에게 내려오는 꿈을, 만명은 신축일 밤에 한 어린아이가 황금 갑옷을 입고 구름을 타고 집 안으로 들어오는 꿈을 꾸고 유신을 갖게 되었으며, 원래 경진일 밤에 서현이 꾼 태몽으로 얻었다 하여 이름을 경진으로 지으려던 것을, ""날이나 달의 이름을 따서 이름을 지어서는 안 된다""는 《예기》의 말에 따라, 경(庚)과 자획이 비슷한 '유', '진'과 발음이 비슷한 '신'을 써서 이름을 유신이라 짓게 되었다고 한다. 
신라의 만노군 즉 충청북도 진천군 진천읍 상계리에는 김유신과 관련된 전승을 전하는 지명이 온존해 있으며, 현지의 태령산(胎靈山)이라는 지명도 김유신이 태어난 뒤에 그의 탯줄을 묻었다는 전승이 전해지고 있다. 현재 김유신의 탄생지와 그의 태실로 전하는 곳은 모두 '진천 김유신 탄생지와 태실'이라는 이름으로 대한민국의 사적지로 지정되어 있다.

청년기
낭비성 전투
건복 46년, 진평왕 51년(629년) 가을 8월, 왕명을 받고 고구려의 낭비성을 치게 된 아버지를 따라 종군했을 때 그의 나이는 35세였다. 김유신이 군중에서 갖고 있던 직책은 《삼국사기》 본기에는 부장군(副將軍), 열전에는 중당당주(中幢幢主)로 기재되어 있다. 《삼국사기》 권40 직관지 하(下)에 중당(仲幢)이라는 부대명이 있지만, 이것이 설치된 것은 문무왕 11년(671년)의 일이다.
1차 접전에서 고구려군에 크게 패한 신라군이 사기가 꺾이고 싸울 의지마저 잃게 되자, 유신은 직접 나서서 적진을 오가며 적을 교란시키고 적군 장수의 목을 베어 가지고 돌아왔다. 이에 고취된 신라군은 다시 용기를 얻어 진격해 고구려군과 싸웠고, 성 안에 남아 있던 고구려군은 두려워한 나머지 더 이상 싸울 의지를 잃고 항복했다고 한다.

김춘추와의 만남
기록상 유신의 첫 전투로 알려진 낭비성에서의 싸움에 신라군 지휘관으로 참전했던 인물 가운데는 파진찬 김용춘도 포함되어 있었다. 용춘의 아들로서 훗날 태종 무열왕으로 즉위하게 되는 김춘추와는 훗날 정치적 동맹자로서 굳건한 관계를 맺게 되는데, 이들 사이의 동맹에는 양자간에 중첩적인 혼인을 통한 혈연관계 형성이 주요한 토대가 되었다. 《삼국유사》에는 이와 관련해서 다음과 같은 이야기가 전한다.
때는 정월 오기일(烏忌日), 뜰에서 춘추와 함께 축국을 하던 유신은 일부러 그의 옷고름을 밟아 터지게 하고서, 옷고름을 꿰맨다는 핑계로 그를 자신의 집으로 데려가 누이동생 문희에게 그 옷고름을 꿰매게 하였다. 이 일이 계기가 되어 춘추는 자주 유신의 집을 드나들게 되었고 마침내 문희가 임신하게 되자 유신은 ""혼인도 하지 않고 아이를 가진 누이를 화형에 처할 것""이라는 소문을 퍼뜨리게 한 뒤, 왕이 남산에 행차하는 날에 맞춰서 집 뒤뜰에 장작더미를 쌓아놓고 불을 질러서 연기를 피워올렸다. 남산에서 이 연기를 목격한 왕이 좌우 신료들에게 묻자, 신료들은 자신들이 들은 소문을 왕에게 아뢰었고, 마침 왕의 옆에 있다가 그 말을 듣고 안색이 변한 춘추를 본 왕은 아이의 아버지가 그임을 짐작하며 얼른 가서 구해주라는 명령을 내렸다. 이것이 계기가 되어 두 사람은 마침내 혼인하게 되었다.
선덕여왕 인평 9년(642년) 백제는 대야성을 비롯한 신라 서쪽 40여 성(城)을 쳐서 함락시켰는데 이 과정에서 춘추의 사위였던 대야성주 김품석(金品釋) 부부가 죽자 김춘추는 딸의 원수를 갚기 위해 고구려에 원병 파병을 요청하러 떠났다. 고구려로 떠나기 전날, 김춘추는 김유신을 찾아와 “지금 내가 고구려에 사신으로 가려 하는데, 60일이 지나도 내가 돌아오지 않는다면 이후 다시는 나를 볼 수 없을 것이다. 그렇게 된다면 공은 어찌하겠소?”하고 묻자, 김유신은 “그때는 내 말의 발굽이 백제와 고구려, 두 나라 왕의 정원을 짓밟을 것이다.”라고 대답하였다. 그리고 두 사람은 손가락을 깨물어 피로 맹세를 나누었다. 김춘추가 떠난 뒤 압량주(押梁州, 지금의 경상북도 경산 주변)의 군주(軍主)로 옮겨간 김유신은 김춘추가 고구려에서 억류되었다는 소식에 군사 1만(열전에는 3천)을 모아 결사대를 조직하고 왕에게 고구려로 보내 줄 것을 요청해 출동 기일에 대한 칙허를 받아냈으며, 신라에 간첩으로 와 있던 승려 덕창(德昌)으로부터 이 소식을 접한 고구려 조정은 전쟁 방지를 위해 김춘추를 석방했고, 김춘추는 무사히 풀려났다.

백제와의 전쟁
인평 11년(644년) 진골 귀족이 오를 수 있는 최고의 관등인 소판(蘇判)으로 승진하였다. 가을 9월에는 상장군(上將軍)이 되어, 왕명으로 백제의 가혜성(加兮城) · 성열성(省熱城) · 동화성(同火城) 등을 포함한 7성을 점령했다. 이듬해(645년) 정월에 서라벌로 돌아와 개선 보고도 하기 전에 다시 계백이 이끈 백제군이 매리포성에 쳐들어왔다는 급보가 날아들자 여왕은 유신을 상주장군으로 삼아 막게 했다. 유신은 집에 들르지도 않고 곧바로 달려나가 백제군 2천여 명의 목을 베는 승리를 거두었고, 음력 3월에 다시 백제의 침공을 격퇴했다.

비담의 난
인평 14년(647년) 정월에 상대등 비담·염종 등이 '여자 임금은 능히 나라를 다스리지 못한다'는 이유를 들어 반란을 일으켰다. 반란은 진압되었고 그 사이 선덕여왕이 승하하고 그 뒤를 이어 선덕여왕의 사촌인 승만공주가 왕위를 계승하여 진덕여왕이 되었다.
《삼국사기》에는 비담의 난에 김유신이 활약했다는 언급이 본기에는 없고 김유신열전에만 기록되어 있는데, 이로 인해서 김유신이 실제로 비담의 난 진압에 관여한 것이 맞느냐는 의문이 제기되기도 한다. 김유신열전에 실려 있는 이야기는 다음과 같다. 
명활성에 들어간 반군과 맞서 김유신은 춘추와 함께 월성에 설치된 진영에 주둔하며 열흘 동안 반란군과 대치했다. 그러다 한밤중에 큰 별 하나가 월성에 떨어지는 것을 본 비담이 병사들에게 “별이 떨어진 곳은 반드시 피를 흘린다 하니 이는 여왕이 패하고 내가 승리할 징조다!”라고 하여 반군의 사기는 크게 치솟았다. 월성에도 이 소식이 알려져 왕이 걱정하였는데, 김유신이 나서서 ""별이 떨어지는 것은 기상현상일 뿐이고 지혜와 덕으로 요사함을 눌러 이길 수 있다""고 하여 진정시킨 뒤, 몰래 사람을 시켜 허수아비를 커다란 연에 매달아 불을 붙이고 밤에 몰래 하늘로 띄워 올린 다음, 병사들에게 “어젯밤에 떨어진 별은 다시 하늘로 올라갔다!”는 소문을 퍼뜨렸다. 반란군이 동요하는 사이에 유신은 명활성을 쳐서 함락시키고, 비담을 쳐서 9족을 모두 죽였다.

장년기
반란을 진압한 후 압량주군주로 부임한 유신은 10월에는 무산성(茂山城, 지금의 전라북도 무주군 무풍면), 감물성(甘勿城, 지금의 경상북도 김천시 개령면), 동잠성(桐岑城, 지금의 경상북도 구미시)에 들어온 백제군을 격퇴했다. 진덕여왕 태화(太和) 원년(648년) 백제에게 빼앗겼던 대량주를 다시 공격하여 수복하고, 백제의 12성을 함락시킨 공으로 이찬(伊飡)으로 승진한 뒤 상주행군대총관(上州行軍大摠管)에 임명되었다.
김유신은 예전에 백제에게 빼앗긴 대야성을 되찾기 위해 진덕여왕의 허가를 받고 출전하였다. 김유신이 근처 계곡에 군사를 매복시킨 뒤 대야성 밖에 이르자 백제군이 공격해 왔다. 백제군과 한동안 맞서 싸우던 김유신은 갑자기 군사를 돌려 후퇴하였다. 이것을 본 백제군은 성 밖으로 나와 신라군을 뒤쫓았다. 이때 계곡에 숨어 있던 군사들이 일제히 뛰쳐나와 백제군의 후방을 공격하자, 후퇴하던 김유신도 즉시 군사를 돌려 협공을 가해 백제군 1천여 명이 죽었다. 그리고 백제 진영과의 교섭을 통해, 전투에서 사로잡은 백제 장군 여덟 명을 돌려보내는 조건으로 앞서 대야성에서 죽은 김품석 내외의 유골을 송환받는 데 성공했다. 승세를 몰아 유신은 거듭 백제를 쳐서 악성(嶽城) 등 12성을 함락시켰으며, 2만여 명을 죽이고 9천여 명을 사로잡았다. 그 공으로 김유신은 상주행군대총관에 올랐다. 이어 김유신은 백제의 진례성 등 9개의 성을 쳐서 9천여 명을 죽이고 6백여 명을 사로잡았다. 한편 이 해에 당에 사신으로 들어갔던 춘추는 당의 황제로부터 원병 파병의 약속을 얻어내고, 아들 한 명을 당의 황제 옆에 남겨두어 숙위하게 한 뒤 귀국하고 있다.
8월, 백제의 장군인 좌평 은상(殷相)이 대군을 이끌고 석토(石吐) 등 7성을 기습해 대량의 전사자가 나고, 석토성 등 7개의 성을 백제에 빼앗기자 유신은 다시 군사를 이끌고 싸움터로 나아가 은상과 자견(自堅)을 비롯한 백제 장수 10명과 8,980명에 달하는 백제군을 죽이고, 달솔 정중(正仲) 등 장수 100명을 사로잡았으며 말 1만 필과 갑주 1,800필을 노획한다. 서라벌로 돌아온 김유신은 진덕여왕으로부터 직접 환대를 받는 등 극진한 예우를 입었다고 한다.

노년기
김춘추의 추대와 백제 멸망
진덕여왕 8년(654년) 봄 3월에 여왕이 후사를 남기지 못하고 서거하자 화백은 상대등이었던 알천을 추대했으나, 알천은 이를 거부하며 이찬 춘추를 왕으로 추대하였다. 이가 태종 무열왕이다. 이때의 유신의 정치적 영향력은 귀족 회의인 화백의 결정을 취소시키고 자신의 연척인 춘추를 왕으로 추대할 만큼 성장해 있었다.
무열왕 2년(655년) 유신은 대각간(大角干)에 임명되었다. 이 해 1월에 고구려, 백제, 말갈의 연합군이 신라 북쪽 33개의 성을 빼앗았다. 세 나라하고 전쟁을 치르는 와중에 김유신은 9월에 백제의 도비천성(刀比川城)을 공격하여 함락시켰다. 10월 무열왕의 셋째 딸이자 외조카였던 지소와 혼인했다. 이러한 신라 왕실과의 이중, 삼중의 혼맥을 통해 그는 신라의 최고 권력자로 부상했다. 그리고 그해에, 유신은 백제와의 전쟁에서 포로가 되었다가 좌평 임자(壬子)의 가노가 된 전(前) 부산현령(夫山縣令) 급찬 조미압을 통해 임자와 연계하는데 성공, 그로부터 백제의 내부 사정에 대한 정보를 얻었다.
무열왕 7년(660년) 초에 그는 상대등으로 승진했다. 이 해 6월 마침내 당 고종은 신라에 대한 원병 파병을 실행에 옮겨, 대장군 소정방 · 유백영(劉伯英)이 지휘하는 13만 수군을 신라로 보냈다. 유신은 왕명으로 태자 법민(法閔)과 장군 김진주 · 김천존 등과 함께 큰 배 1백 척을 타고 당병이 주둔하는 덕물도로 갔고, 이곳에서 당병은 뱃길, 신라군은 땅으로 7월 10일에 백제의 수도 사비성 앞에서 합류해 백제를 친다는 계획을 세웠다. 유신은 5만 병사를 이끌고 사비성으로 향하던 중, 백제의 계백이 이끄는 5천 병력과 황산 벌판에서 만나 치열한 전투 끝에 승리, 가까스로 소정방군과 합류해 백제를 쳐서 멸망시켰다. 이때 황산벌 싸움 탓에 당초 당군과 약속한 7월 10일에서 하루 늦은 것을 트집잡아 신라측 독군 김문영을 처형하려 드는 소정방에게, ""그러면 우리는 백제를 쳐부수기 전에 당과 먼저 싸울 것이다!""는 태도로 맞서 끝내 소정방을 물러서게 했다. 또한 당 고종으로부터 현지에서의 일을 임의대로 처리하도록 권한을 위임받은 소정방이 유신과 김인문 · 김양도(金良圖) 세 사람을 포섭하기 위해 “지금 얻은 백제의 땅을 그대들에게 식읍으로 나눠주겠다”고 하자 유신은 ""굳이 우리만 상을 받을 수는 없는 일이다.""라는 간곡한 말로 거절한다.
당병이 백제 땅에 주둔하면서 기회를 봐서 신라를 치려고 하는 것을 파악한 그는 신라군을 백제군으로 변장시켜 당병을 치게 하자는 계획을 진언했고, 소정방은 일부 잔여 병력만을 백제의 옛 수도 사비성에 남긴 채 자신은 의자왕과 백제 신료 93인, 1만여 명을 포로로 데리고 당으로 돌아갔다. 이후 무열왕의 뒤를 이어 유신의 조카이자 처형(妻兄)인 태자 법민이 즉위하자, 유신은 그를 도와 섭정과 외교 활동을 겸하며 삼한일통 전쟁을 지속해 나갔다.

고구려의 멸망
당은 백제의 옛 수도 사비성에 군사를 주둔시키고 고구려 공격의 후방 기지로 삼는 동시에 신라를 견제하는 역할을 수행하게 하려 했지만, 백제 멸망 직후부터 백제 땅 전역에서 시작된 흥복운동으로 그 계획은 막혀버렸다. 백제의 옛 귀족인 귀실복신과 승려 도침이 지휘하는 백제 흥복군은 당병이 주둔하던 사비성을 포위해 궁지에 몰아넣었고, 신라군은 백제 흥복군을 진압하는 한편으로 그들의 포위망을 뚫고 고립되어 물자 보급이 끊어진 사비성의 당병에게 소금과 간장을 보내주기에 급급했다. 한편 사비성이 함락된 해 11월에는 고구려가 다시 신라를 공격해 칠중성(七重城)에서 성주 필부(匹夫)가 전사하고, 이듬해인 무열왕 8년(661년) 5월에는 고구려가 말갈의 병사들까지 동원하여 신라의 북한산성(아차산성)을 공격해 20일 동안 전투를 치르고서야 퇴각하고 있다.
9월에 신라와 당 사이의 주요 연락거점 한가운데에 위치해 백제군의 점거하에 있던 옹산성(瓮山城)이 함락되었고, 당병과의 연합작전 계획에 따라 신라군이 평양으로 향하던 도중, 평양을 포위하고 있던 소정방으로부터의 다급한 군량수송 요청이 함자도총관 유덕민을 통해 들어왔다. 적지에 들어가 군량을 수송하고 돌아와야 하는 어려운 작전에 누구도 자원하려는 자가 없는 가운데, 유신이 스스로 임무를 수행하겠다고 자청해왔다. 문무왕은 기뻐하며 곧 떠나려는 유신에게 ""국경을 넘어서부터, 상벌은 마음대로 하라(出疆之後 賞罰專之可也)""는 면책특권을 주었다. 12월 10일에 유신은 군량 수송을 위해 부장군 김인문 · 김진복(金眞服) · 김양도 등과 함께 쌀 4천 섬과 조(租) 22,250섬을 당군 진영까지 수송할 수송부대를 이끌고 고구려 국경으로 들어갔다. 이때 유신의 나이는 68세였다.
문무왕 2년(662년) 정월 23일에 칠중하(七重河)에 이르러, 두려워 배에 오를 생각을 않는 장병들에게 호통을 치며 먼저 배를 타고 건넜고 이에 모든 장병들이 따라서 강을 건넜다. 유신은 고구려군이 큰길에서 지킬 것을 염려해 일부러 험하고 좁은 길을 택해 나아갔는데, 이따금 길에서 적병을 만나 싸워서 이기면서 장새(獐塞)의 험한 곳에 이르렀다. 겨울의 혹한에 사람과 말이 지치고 피곤해 쓰러지는 자가 속출하는 앞에서 유신은 웃옷을 벗고 직접 채찍을 잡고 말을 몰아 앞에서 사람들을 이끌었다고 한다. 그렇게 험한 길을 빠져나와 휘하의 보기감(步騎監) 열기(裂起)·구근(仇近) 등 15명을 먼저 평양에 보내어 신라군이 도착했음을 소정방에게 알렸는데, 이때 소정방은 난새와 송아지를 종이에 그려 보냈다. 원효(元曉)의 풀이로 이것이 신라군에게 ""어서 군사를 돌리라(速還)""는 암호문임이 확인되었고, 양오(楊隩)에 진을 치고 있던 유신은 김인문과 김양도, 아들 김군승을 보내 당의 진영에 군량을 보내고, 소정방은 군량을 받자마자 바로 퇴각했다.
유신의 명령으로 당의 진영에 갔던 양도 등은 따로 군사 8백 명과 함께 뱃길로 귀국했는데, 유신은 퇴각하는 길에 고구려군의 기습에 대비해 북과 북채를 모든 소의 허리와 꼬리에 매달아 뛸 때마다 소리를 내게 하고, 또 땔나무를 쌓아 놓고 태워서 연기와 불이 끊이지 않게 해 놓는 등 교란 작전을 펼치면서 밤중에 몰래 표하(瓢河, 임진강)까지 이르렀다. 강을 건너기에 이르러 유신은 나중에 건너는 놈은 베겠다는 명을 내렸고, 군사들이 다투어 강을 건너는데 반쯤 건너자 고구려 병사들이 추격해 와서 미처 건너지 못한 신라 병사들을 잡아 죽였다. 유신은 다음날 고구려 병사를 뒤쫓아 수만 명을 죽였다. 나루를 건너 강가에서 쉬는데 고구려군이 다시 추격해오자, 유신은 쇠뇌를 이용한 집단사격으로 고구려군을 역습해 패퇴시켰으며, 고구려의 소형 아달혜를 사로잡고 고구려군 1만여 명을 목베는 전과를 올렸다. 서울로 돌아와 공을 논하는 자리에서, 유신은 먼저 선발대로 뽑아 보냈던 열기와 구근에게 미리 급찬(級飡)을 준 뒤, 문무왕에게 그들의 공로를 논하며 급찬보다 높은 사찬(沙飡)을 주어야 한다고 주장해 이를 관철시켰다.
한편 백제 흥복군 내부에서는 분열이 일어나, 도침이 복신에게 살해당하고 복신이 전권을 차지했으나 다시 부여풍(扶餘豊)에게 살해당하는 등 혼란이 거듭되는 가운데, 부여풍은 재차 고구려와 왜에 원병을 청해 나·당 연합군의 공격을 막으려 했다. 663년, 당으로부터 증원된 손인사 등이 이끄는 수군과, 문무왕과 유신 등의 네 장수들이 이끄는 육군이 서로 육지와 바다에서 백제와 왜의 연합군을 쳐서 이기고 마침내 백제 흥복군의 본거지 주류성(周留城)을 함락시켰다. 그 공으로 유신은 겨울 11월 20일에 토지 500결을 상으로 받았다.
665년에 당 고종이 보낸 사신 양동벽(梁冬碧) · 임지고(任智高) 등이 유신을 문안하여, 그에게 봉상정경(奉常正卿) · 평양군개국공(平壤郡開國公) 식읍(食邑) 2천 호라는 당의 관직을 주었다. 666년에는 맏아들인 대아찬 김삼광이 당 고종의 요청으로 당에 불려가, 좌무위익부중랑장(左武衛翊府中郞將)으로서 고종을 숙위하게 되었다. 667년 고구려 정벌에 나섰으나 병으로 싸움터에 나가지는 못하였다. 대신에 문무왕이 원정을 나가고 유신은 내정을 맡아보았다. 668년 대총관(大摠管)에 임명되었으나, 늙고 쇠약해진 데다 병까지 들어 직접 원정에 참가하지는 못하고 서라벌에 남았으며, 대신 유신의 조카이자 처형인 김인문과 유신의 아우인 김흠순 등이 대신 주장(主將)으로 나섰다. 그리고 9월 26일에 나·당 연합군은 마침내 평양을 함락시키고 고구려를 멸했다. 한편 이 날, 왜(倭)에서는 오키미 덴지(大王天智)의 근신 나카토미노 가마타리(中臣鎌足)가 신라의 사신인 사훼급찬(沙喙級湌) 김동엄(金東嚴) 등에게 김유신에게 선물할 배 한 척을 호벤(法弁)·신비쓰(秦筆) 두 사문을 시켜 전달하고, 사흘 뒤에는 문무왕에게도 또 수어조선(輸御調船) 한 척을 선물하였다.
회군하는 길에 남천주에 들른 문무왕은 예전 유신의 할아버지와 아버지가 조정에 봉사하며 세운 공과 유신이 그간 이룬 일들을 신료들 앞에서 술회하며 유신에게 태대서발한(太大舒發翰)의 관등과 식읍 5백 호를 내리고, 수레와 지팡이를 내림과 동시에 대궐에서 몸을 굽히지 않는 것이 허락되었으며, 유신의 요좌들에게도 모두 1등급씩 위계를 올려주고 있다. 당 고종 또한 김유신에게 조서(詔書)를 주었는데, 그 실물은 유신의 5세손 때까지 보전되다 실전되었다고 한다. 이후 병으로 직접 정치나 군사활동에는 참여하지는 못하고, 다만 왕실과 군사의 원로로서 왕에게 여러 차례 전략 수립에 대해 자문을 맡았다.

나당전쟁
백제와 고구려가 멸망한 뒤, 당은 그 옛 땅에 웅진도독부와 안동도호부를 설치하여 직접 통치하려는 야욕을 드러내는 것은 물론, 신라에 대해서도 문무왕에게 계림주대도독(鷄林州大都督)이란 관직을 내리는 등 신라를 당의 일개 기미주로 취급하며, 한반도 전체를 지배하려 했다. 이미 당은 백제 흥복운동이 진압된 직후인 664년에 백제 의자왕의 아들인 부여융(扶餘隆)을 웅진도독으로 파견하고 문무왕을 호출하여 취리산 에서 회맹(조약)을 체결하게 했는데, 이는 당의 괴뢰정권으로서 백제를 부활시켜 신라와 맞서게 하려는 것으로 신라에 의한 평양-패강 이남의 지배를 인정한다는 당초의 약속과도 어긋나는 것이었다. 또한 고구려가 멸망한 뒤에는 이미 예전에 신라가 고구려로부터 빼앗아 차지하고 있던 비열홀을 신라로부터 강제로 빼앗아 고구려에 주는 등, 당은 서서히 신라에 대한 영향력 확대를 시도하고 있었다.
최종적으로는 당이 백제와 고구려 다음으로 신라를 노릴 것이라는 사실은 김유신에 의해 이미 예견된 것이었다. 신라는 한반도에서 당병을 몰아내기 위한 전쟁을 시작했고, 고구려 부흥군을 지원하여 백제 땅에 주둔하던 당병을 습격해 그들을 몰아내고 백제 지역에 대한 지배 체제를 다져 나갔다. 고구려군을 지원하던 신라군은 672년 말갈과 연합해 석문(石文) 벌팔에 진을 치고 있던 당군과의 전투에서 대패하였다. 신라의 여러 장수들이 전사한 이 전투에 유신의 아들로서 신라군 비장(裨將)의 자격으로 참전했던 김원술이 살아오자 유신은 원술에게 비장으로서 다른 장수들을 따라 죽지 못하고 목숨을 부지한 것을 '왕명을 무시하고 가풍(家風)을 더럽힌 죄'를 물어 처형할 것을 청했다. 문무왕은 이를 거절하고 원술을 사면했으나, 이후 원술은 집에도 돌아가지 못한 채 산 속에 근신하여 이후 유신이 숨을 거둘 때까지 숨어 살았다. 한편으로 석문에서의 패배 이후 직접적인 전투보다는 성 위주의 방어전으로 전술을 변경하자는 김유신의 조언에 따라, 신라는 한산주에 주장성을 쌓는 등 각지에 방어 거점을 구축하고, 앞서 포로로 잡은 웅진도독부 소속 당병들을 9월에 돌려 보내고 사죄문의 형식을 담은 표문을 당에 바쳤다.

사망
문무왕 13년(673년) 봄 정월에 황룡사와 재성 사이에 큰 별이 떨어지고 지진이 일어나 조정과 민간이 어수선해지자, 유신은 왕을 알현하여 이번의 재앙은 국가가 아닌 자신에게 일어날 일에 대한 흉조이니 신경쓸 것 없다며 위로했다. 이후 병들어 누운 자신을 문병하러 방문한 문무왕에게, ""처음부터 못하는 이야 없진 않겠지만, 끝까지 잘 맺는 이는 거의 없다네(靡不有初 鮮克有終)""라는 《시경》의 말을 인용하며 신하로서 왕에게 당부하는 말을 전했다. 그리고 며칠 뒤 자택에서 숨을 거둔다. 기일은 7월 1일, 향년 79세였다.
《삼국사기》열전에는 김유신의 죽음과 관련해 이런 이야기를 수록하였다. 김유신이 병을 얻기 한 달 전, 군복을 입고 무기를 든 수십 명이 그의 집에서 울면서 나오더니 곧 연기처럼 사라져 버리는 것이 목격되었는데, 유신은 이를 전해 듣고 ""지금까지 나를 지켜 주던 음병(陰兵)이 내 복이 다한 것을 보고 떠나간 것""이라며, 자신이 얼마 못 가서 죽을 것임을 예상했다는 것이다. 
문무왕은 김유신의 죽음을 듣고 크게 슬퍼하며 비단 1천 필과 조 2천 석을 부조로 보내고 군악의 고취수(鼓吹手) 100명을 장례식에 보내주었다. 유신의 유해는 금산원(金山原)에 묻혔고, 왕명으로 그의 공적을 기록한 비석이 무덤 앞에 세워졌으며, 수묘인을 두어 무덤을 지키게 했다.
흥덕왕(興德王, 《삼국유사》는 경명왕) 10년(835년), '흥무왕(興武王)'으로 추존되어 사후 왕으로 지위가 격상되었다.

인물
김유신의 인물상은 대개 《삼국사기》나 《삼국유사》에 나온 것이 전부다. 유년 시절의 일화로 유명한 것은 《파한집》(破閑集)에 수록된 것으로, 소년 시절의 김유신이 천관(天官)이라는 기생에게 반해 자주 그녀의 집에 드나들었는데, 어머니의 꾸중을 듣고 다시는 그녀의 집으로 출입하지 않기로 맹세하였다. 어느 날 술에 취하여 집에 돌아가는 길에 말 위에서 깜박 잠이 들었는데, 말은 주인이 늘 가던 대로 그녀의 집 앞으로 가서 멈추었다. 천관이 나와서 보고 반가워하고 또한 원망스러워 눈물을 흘리는데, 유신은 말에서 내려 그 자리에서 말의 목을 베고 안장까지 내버린 채 돌아왔다. 사후 그녀가 살던 집터에는 천관사(天官寺)라는 절이 세워졌다.
김유신 개인이 지니고 있었던 가치관으로는, 비담의 난을 진압하면서 별이 왕궁인 월성에 떨어진 것에 기세가 오른 반군을 상대로 놀라 어쩔줄 모르는 여왕과 신료들을 향해 ""길함과 불길함이란 정해져 있는 것이 아니라 오로지 사람이 부르는 것이고, 요사함은 사람의 지혜와 덕망으로 물리칠 수 있다"" 이라며 일축하는 개명된 태도를 보이기도 한다. 《삼국유사》에는 신라의 원병 요청을 받고 백강까지 도착한 당군 장수 소정방이 갑자기 하늘에 나타나 장군의 진영 위를 빙빙 맴도는 새를 보고, '원수(元首)가 해를 입을 징조'라 하여 겁먹고 상륙하지 않으려는 것을 ""겨우 저런 것 때문에 일을 그르쳐서야 되겠습니까.""라며 칼을 새에게 겨누자 새는 몸이 찢겨져 땅에 떨어져버리고, 소정방은 그제서야 의구심을 풀고 군사를 백강에 상륙시켜 전투에 나섰다는 기록도 있다. 다만 이 기록은 소정방이 백강에서 상륙하기 직전 김유신은 백강이 아니라 황산벌에 있었다는 시간적 모순이 생겨, 후대 사람들이 김유신을 부각시키고 일부러 소정방의 용렬함을 강조하기 위해 창작했거나 비슷한 사건이 전투 초기에 있었던 일인 것처럼 와전되었을 가능성이 있다.
흔히 사대주의의 표상으로 인식되어 온 김유신이지만, 황산벌 전투로 약속 기일에서 하루 늦은 것을 트집잡아 신라군 독군 김문영을 처형하려 하자 ""황산벌에서 우리가 어떻게 싸웠는지 보지도 못하고, 그저 기일이 늦은 것을 트집잡아 우리에게 죄를 주려 한다. 아무 죄도 없이 나는 이따위 모욕을 받을 수 없으니, 나는 당병과 먼저 싸우고 난 다음에 백제를 깨뜨리겠다!"" 며 강경한 태도를 보여 끝내 소정방이 한 발 물러서게 했고, 당병이 아직은 동맹이지만 백제와 고구려를 멸하고 나면 다음은 신라가 그들의 목표가 될 것을 예측하고 그들과 싸울 계책을 왕에게 추천하기도 했다. 무열왕이 ""우리를 위해 우리의 적을 멸해준 그들을 친다면, 하늘이 우리를 도와주겠느냐?""며 소극적인 태도를 보이자, 유신은 ""개도 꼬리를 밟으면 자기 주인이라도 가리지 않고 그 다리를 물어버리는 법. 어려움을 당하여 어찌 자신을 구하지 않을 수 있겠습니까."" 라 말하여, 지금 동맹이나 혈맹관계에 있다 해서 그저 무조건 의지하고 따라다니기만 해서는 안 된다는 철저한 현실적 태도를 견지하고 있다.
군사적인 면에서는 할아버지 때부터 쌓아온 집안의 가풍을 중시해, 당과의 전투에서 패하고 살아 돌아온 원술에 대해 ""왕명을 어기고 가훈을 더럽힌 죄를 물어 목을 베소서"" 라 왕에게 청하는 등 강경한 태도를 보여, 끝내 아들이 집안으로부터 버림받아 평생 숨어살도록 몰아갔다. 실제로 가문의 안위를 중요하게 여기는 그의 모습은 훗날 죽은지 100년이나 지나 무열왕계 독재의 강화와 함께 그의 자손이 신라 정계로부터 냉대받으며 소홀한 대접을 받게 되자 그의 무덤에서 회오리바람이 일고 탄식하는 소리가 들렸다는《삼국사기》속의 일화로 나타나기도 한다. 
한편으로는 개개인의 골품이나 신분, 관례보다는 능력과 공적을 중시해, 662년 평양을 포위한 소정방의 당병에게 군량을 수송하는 데에 공을 세운 휘하의 열기 · 구근에게 사찬이라는 벼슬을 내려줄 것을 청하며, 너무 과하지 않느냐는 왕의 지적에 ""벼슬은 공적을 담는 그릇으로 공에 보답하여 주는 것인데 무엇이 지나치겠습니까.""라는 말로 기어이 두 사람의 관등 수여를 관철시킨다. 당시 열기는 신라군 내의 보기감(步騎監)을 맡고 있었는데, 보기감은 신라에서 군사감(軍師監)과 함께 사지에서 나마(奈麻)까지의 관등을 가진 자들이 맡던 관직으로(《삼국사기》직관지), 급찬이나 사찬으로 오른다는 것은 파격적인 승진이었다.

평가
전근대
인신(人臣)으로써의 평가
이미 신라 당대부터 김유신은 나라를 크게 일으킨 충신이자 주석지신으로 숭앙받았다. ""유신 각간이 세상에 나서 대업을 이루어 나라의 보배가 되었기에""(중화 3년명 금동사리기기), ""오산(鼇山)의 정기를 받고 접수(鰈水)의 정기를 타고났다. 문부(文符)를 쥐고 재상의 집안에 태어나 무략(武略)으로 왕실을 높이 떠받들었으며… 마침내 두 적(敵)를 완전히 평정하여 토군(兎郡)의 사람들을 길이 편안하게 하였고, 세 임금(진덕왕, 무열왕, 문무왕)을 잘 받들어 진한(辰韓)의 풍속을 크게 위로하였다.""(진경대사탑비) 등 신라 하대에 이르기까지 김유신은 신라 국가와 왕실을 위하여 힘쓴 업적과 능력을 높이 평가받았다.
김유신은 양신이자 성신으로써 태종 무열왕을 도와 삼한을 통일하였으며, 사후 동해의 용이 되었다는 전승이 퍼진 문무왕과 함께 불교의 삼십삼천의 화신으로 신라를 진호한다는 인식이 널리 퍼졌다. 신라에서 무열왕에게 당 태종과 같은 '태종'의 묘호를 붙인 것을 당이 항의하며 지우도록 요구했을 때, 신라 조정은 당 태종이 현신(賢臣) 위징(魏徵)을 얻어 대업을 이룬 것과 마찬가지로 무열왕이 성신(聖臣) 김유신을 얻어 삼한일통의 대업을 이루었고 양자가 동격이라는 논리로 거절하고 있다. 
이러한 김유신에 대한 신라 왕실과 조정의 고평가는 그에 대한 흥무대왕(興武大王) 추봉으로 그 정점을 찍었다. 흥무 즉 ‘무(武)를 일으킨(興)‘ 자로써 김유신이 무장으로써 보였던 능력을 높이 평가했음을 보여주는 것으로, 한국사를 통틀어 인신이 왕으로 추봉된 것은 김유신이 유일하다.
고려의 현종(顯宗)은 최치원·설총과 더불어 그를 개국공(開國公)에 봉했다. 《삼국사기》를 지은 김부식은 열전의 총 분량(10권) 가운데 3권을 모두 김유신에게 할애하고 있을 정도로 김유신을 추켜 세웠으며, 조선조에는 무묘(武廟)를 세워 배향해야 할 인물의 한 명으로 거론되기도 했다.

문무왕과 그 신료들
고구려를 멸망시키고 돌아오던 길에 남천주에 들러 문무왕은 그의 조부 때부터 신라 조정에 봉사해 온 일을 들며, ""지금 유신이 할아버지, 아버지의 일을 계승하여 사직(社稷)을 지키는 신하가 되어 나가서는 장수가 되고 들어와서는 재상이 되어 그 공적이 많았으니, 공의 일가에 의지하지 않았더라면 나라의 흥망이 어떻게 되었을지 알 수 없다"" 며 김유신의 공적을 추켜세우면서 관직과 은상을 올려주는 것이 어떠냐고 묻자 신하들은 모두 동의하고 있다.
구근(仇近)
구근은 열기와 함께 김유신의 명으로 소정방에게 군량을 수송하는 역할을 맡았고 그 공으로 김유신의 추천을 받아 사찬에 임명되었다. 김유신의 셋째 아들인 파진찬 원정(元貞)을 따라 서원경(西原京)의 술성(述城)을 쌓는데, 원정이 다른 사람의 말만 듣고 구근이 일을 게을리 한다며 곤장을 치자, 구근은 “나는 일찍이 열기와 더불어 죽음을 헤아릴 수 없는 곳에 들어가 대각간의 명을 욕되게 하지 않았고 대각간께서는 나를 무능하다 하지 않으시고 국사(國士)로 대접하셨는데, 지금 뜬소문을 듣고 나에게 죄를 주니 평생 치욕이 이보다 더 큰 것이 없소.”라며 억울해했고, 원정은 이 말에 평생 부끄러워하고 후회하였다.
윤관
동북 9성을 개척한 윤관은 평소 김유신을 존경했으며, 여진 정벌을 앞두고 사람들에게 ""김유신이 전쟁할 때 6월이라 여름이었는데도 강물이 얼어붙어 군사들이 건널 수 있었던 것은 다름아닌 지성으로써 이루어진 것이니, 나라고 그렇게 못할 것이 무엇이겠는가""라며 전의를 불태웠다고 한다. 다만 이것이 언제 어느 때를 가리키는지에 대해서는 분명하지 않다.
김부식
《삼국사기》 열전 말미에서 김부식은 을지문덕의 지략과 장보고의 의용도 중국의 서적이 아니었으면 영영 잊혀질 뻔 했는데 김유신 같은 이는 우리 나라 사람들이 칭송하여 사대부는 물론 꼴 베고 나무하는 아이까지도 능히 알고 있다며, 그 사람됨이 반드시 다른 사람과 차이가 있었을 것이라고 평가하고 있다. 그런 한편으로 “유신의 재능뿐 아니라 신라 조정에서 그를 중용하여 믿고 일을 맡겨 의심하지 않았기 때문에 그가 공업을 이룰 수 있었다”며 신라 조정의 역할을 은근히 강조하여, 신라 조정이 김유신에게 그랬던 것처럼 고려 조정과 인종도 김부식 자신을 전적으로 믿고 기용해 주기를 바라는 기대를 내심 비치고 있다.
최보
안정복의 《동사강목》에 인용된 사론에서는 유신을 두고 ""충분(忠憤)한 마음과 영위(英偉)한 지략을 기울여 통일의 공을 이루고 위(位)는 장상(將相)을 겸하여, 몸소 국가의 안위를 도맡아 20여 년 동안 우뚝 국가의 장성(長城)""이 된, ""뛰어난 재주로 그 훌륭한 임금과 적당한 때를 얻어 그 큰 공을 이룬 자""라 평가하며, ""어려움을 두루 겪으면서 국사를 위하여 몸을 바쳐 공명과 충절을 처음부터 끝까지 모두 보전하였으니, 유신 같은 사람이야말로 비길 만한 데가 드물다""고 호평하고 ""예로부터 영웅호걸의 선비는 비상한 재주가 있어도 꼭 같이 일할 임금을 얻지 못하거나, 어쩌다 같이 일할 임금을 얻어도 같이 일할 때를 얻지 못했다. 비상한 재주를 가지고 같이 일을 도모할 임금을 만나고 같이 일을 도모할 때를 얻어서 세상에 보기 드문 공을 이룩한 자의 예를 김유신에게서 볼 수 있다""며 김유신이 영웅으로 남을 공을 세운 것은 같이 일할 올바른 임금을 만났던 것과 김유신 개인의 재능이 뛰어났던 것에 있다고 평하며, 그가 임종에 문무왕에게 남긴 유언을 신하가 임금에게 할 수 있는 조언들의 요점이라고 호평했다. 한편으로 흥덕왕이 그를 흥무왕으로 추봉한 것에 대해서는 고대 주(周)의 성왕(成王)이 숙부이자 재상이었던 주공(周公)의 제사를 천자의 그것과 준하게 한 일을 들어, 아무리 공이 크다고는 하지만 ""신하로서 충성하는 것은 지극히 당연한 일"", ""군신의 명분을 문란하게 만든"" 처사라 비판하고 있다.
조선 후기의 문인 강재항(1689-1756)은 최보와 마찬가지로 김유신이 임종에 문무왕에게 한 말을 두고 ”(신하로써) 임금에게 고하는 대체를 깊이 얻은 것”으로 호평하였으며, 제갈공명의 전후출사표조차도 김유신의 이 유언에 미치지 못한다고까지 평가하였다.
또한 고려의 김부식처럼 조선의 문인, 관료들 가운데는 김유신의 인신으로써의 자질이나 죽는 순간까지 내비친 신라 왕실과 국가에 대한 충성심뿐 아니라 그런 김유신을 믿고 맡겼던 왕의 '명덕'(明德)을 강조하는 데에도 김유신을 끌어오곤 했다. 중종(中宗) 27년(1532년)에 생원 이종익이 상소를 올려 중종과 영의정 박원종(朴元宗)을 태종 무열왕과 김유신의 관계에 빗대며, 김유신의 무덤에서 회오리바람이 일어 미추왕의 무덤에 가서 탄식하고 다른 나라로 옮겨가겠다고 청했다는 《삼국유사》의 이야기를 가져와 대며 중종반정의 공신인 박원종과 그 후손들을 잘 대우할 것을 청했다.
영조 5년(1729) 류엄은 입시해 《동국통감》을 진강하는 자리에서 ”태종왕은 김유신의 현명함을 얻어 능히 ’통삼’(삼국통일)의 기틀을 세울 수 있었고 문무왕이 그 자리를 이어 기어이 삼국통합의 공을 이루었으니 가히 성하다 하겠습니다.“라고 하면서, 김유신이 임종 때에 한 유언을 강조해 “실로 천고에 지극히 경계가 되는 말입니다.”라고 칭찬하면서 국왕이 현명한 신하를 등용하는 것의 중요성을 아뢰었다.

무장으로써의 평가
김유신의 군사적 재능에 대한 호평과 찬양은 이미 고려 시대에도 있었고 조선 초기에도 그러했다. 동북 9성을 개척한 윤관은 김유신을 평소 존경해, “김유신이 전쟁할 때에 6월인데도 강이 얼어서 삼군이 건넌 것은 다름아닌 지성으로 이루어진 것이다.”라고 김유신의 ‘지성’을 상찬하였다. 《제왕운기》에서 이승휴는 ”오묘한 병서를 얻어 무예에 뛰어났도다“라고 읊었고, 정추(鄭樞, 1333-1382)는 ”장사는 신기가 있어 칼에다 주문을 외웠고“ ""김유신 장군은 참으로 영웅이라 천년토록 우뚝하고 기이한 공적이라"" 등 김유신을 기리는 시를 남겼다. 여기에는 김유신의 전략이나 전술에 대한 구체적인 분석보다는 김유신이라는 인물의 신성이나 지성이라는 추상적인 개념이 선행된다. 
조선 초에 들어와서 서거정은 김유신을 중국의 제갈량에 비유했고, 박세채는 당의 명장 곽분양(곽자의)이나 명(明)의 서중산(서달)에 비유했다. 세조 2년(1456년) 양성지가 본국의 무성(武成)과 무교(武敎)를 대표하는 인물로 사당에 배향되어야 할 인물로 김유신을 을지문덕, 흑치상지와 함께 언급하기도 하였다. 조선 후기의 성호 이익도 김유신을 무교를 대표하는 인물로써 무성왕의 사당에 배향해야 한다고 평가하였다. 
특히 조선 후기 임진왜란과 병자호란을 겪은 뒤 조선 사회에서는 무장으로써의 김유신의 능력이 더욱 높이 재조명되었는데, “어찌하면 김공을 묘에서 다시 일으켜 취가를 호위하며 오랑캐를 소탕할꼬”(구사맹), “어느 때에나 하늘이 김유신과 강감찬처럼 충의로운 영웅호걸의 신하를 탄생시켜 요망한 기운을 깨끗이 쓸어버리고 큰 수치를 씻을 수 있을지“(성혼) 등 조선의 문인들은 남쪽으로는 일본의 침략과 북쪽으로는 만청의 위협이 가해지는 와중에 김유신 같은 인물이 다시금 나와서 국난을 물리쳐 주기를 바랬던 것이다. 
국방력 강화를 논의하면서 김유신이 거느렸던 쇠뇌 부대가 언급되기도 했다. 특히 661년 호로하 전투에서 김유신이 거느렸다는 쇠뇌 부대가 김유신의 승리의 비결 가운데 하나로 주목되어, 영조 원년(1725) 장흥의 김성대가 상소에서 쇠뇌의 효용성을 논하며 ”신라 김유신이 여러 적을 평정한 것은 이것(쇠뇌)에 힘입은 것인데 세대가 오래 지나고 사람들은 다 죽고 없으니 책에도 나오지 않고 기계도 사라져 이를 풀 사람이 없다“고 한탄하였고 정조 때의 정지원도 비슷한 취지로 한탄하는 언급을 남겼다.

근대 이후
근대 이후 김유신에 대한 부정적 평가가 일부 제기되게 된다. 역사학자 신채호는 김유신이 왕가의 외척이 되기 위해 그의 누이들을 이용했다는 점을 들어, 출세의 수단으로 가족을 이용했다며 부정적으로 평가하였다.

군사적 능력에 대하여
황산벌 전투에서 김유신은 5만의 신라군을 이끌고 5천 군사의 계백과 맞서 싸웠으나 계백을 쉽게 물리치지 못하고 시간을 지체하였다. 군사의 수가 10배인 김유신의 신라군이 계백의 결사대와의 전투에서 서둘렀음에도 하루 지체하였다는 점에서 사실상 김유신이 계백에게 패배한 전투였다는 평가도 있다.
또한 황산벌 전투에서 김유신은 답보 상태에 빠진 대치 상황을 돌파하기 위하여 화랑 반굴과 관창의 죽음을 볼모로 군사의 사기를 높이는 전술을 사용하였다. 어린 화랑을 희생한 것은 비인간적인 것이었고 우세한 군세를 이용한 다양한 전술 구사가 부족했다는 비판을 하며 김유신이 뛰어난 지략가라는 미사여구는 과장된 것이라는 평가가 있다.

삼한일통 과정에서의 행적
백제 정벌은 당나라가 주도했고 고구려는 순전히 연개소문의 아들들의 정권다툼으로 인한 내부의 분열로 자멸한 측면이 있으며 당나라와의 전장에 김유신은 직접 참가하지 않았다. 더군다나 고구려의 군력 자체는 양만춘이 안시성에서 당나라 군대를 상대로 크게 승리를 거둘 정도로 당나라보다 월등했음에도 불구하고 연개소문의 아들들끼리 싸움을 벌이는 바람에 자멸한 것이다. 그렇기 때문에 삼국통일 과정에서 김유신의 역할을 지나치게 칭송하는 삼국사기와 삼국유사의 서술은 공정한 역사 인물에 대한 평가라기 보다는 추종자들이 미화한 이야기라는 견해도 있다.
더군다나 김유신과 신라가 삼국을 통일했다고 볼 수가 없는 것이 고구려의 멸망 자체도 연개소문의 아들들이 자기네들끼리 싸우다가 자멸한 것인 데다가 고구려가 멸망하자마자 바로 고구려의 장수 출신인 대조영이 발해라는 나라를 건국해서 고구려의 유지를 받들었으며 신라가 고구려의 영토를 점령한게 아니라 고구려의 영토는 발해가 차지했다는 점으로 보면 김유신은 고구려를 정벌하지 못했다고 봐야 옳다.

묘소·사당
김유신이 묻힌 금산원의 무덤은 《삼국유사》에는 서산 모지사(毛只寺) 북쪽, 동으로 향해 뻗은 봉우리에 있다고 했다. 《세종실록》지리지에는 모지사 북쪽 봉우리에 있고 부(府)와는 서쪽으로 4리 거리라고 했고, 《신증동국여지승람》에는 경주부 서쪽 서악리(西岳里)라 기록되었다. 김유신의 것이라 전하는 묘소는 오늘날 경상북도 경주시 충효동 산 7-10번지에 있는데 이것이 진짜 김유신의 무덤인가에 대한 의문이 현재까지 끊이지 않고 있다(김유신묘 항목 참조). 이 묘는 1963년 1월 21일 대한민국 국가 사적 제21호로 지정되었다. 
무덤 면적은 14,143m2이다. 봉분 주위에는 묘를 지키는 호석(護石)으로 12방위로 주석(柱石)을 세우고 거기에 십이지신상(十二支神像)을 조각했는데, 머리부분은 동물상이고 몸뚱이 부분은 인상(人像)이며 모두 무기를 잡고 서 있는 모습들이다. 무덤 주위에 십이지신을 새기는 것은 신라에서는 왕의 무덤에만 허락된 것이었다. 김상기는 김유신의 묘가 지금과 같은 왕릉으로서의 형식을 갖추게 된 것은 그가 흥무왕으로 추존된 뒤의 일로 추정하였다. 

기록에 따르면 김유신의 무덤 앞에는 왕명으로 그의 공적을 기록해 새긴 비석이 세워졌는데, 신라의 국자박사(國子博士)였던 설인선(薛因宣)이 그 비문을 지었다고 전하지만 현재는 비석의 흔적도 찾아볼 수 없으며, 다만 《임하필기》에는 그의 묘비가 경주 서쪽 10리 지점에 있었으며, 경주부사를 지냈던 홍양호가 그 묘에 제사를 지내고 비를 찾아보았으나 찾아내지 못하다가 20년 뒤에 이서구(李書九)가 금석첩(金石帖) 속에서 임진왜란 이전에 탁본한 것 몇 장을 발견했는데, 필법이 구양순체와 많이 닮은 것이었다고 증언하고 있다.
현존하는 무덤 앞의 비석은 후대에 그의 후손들이 세운 것이다. 하나에는 '신라태대각간김유신묘'(新羅太大角干金庾信墓), 다른 하나에는 '개국공순충장렬흥무왕릉'(開國公純忠壯烈興武王陵)라 새겨져 있는데, 비석을 새길 당시 그가 흥덕왕으로부터 흥무왕으로 봉해졌음을 미처 알지 못하고 「묘(墓)」라 적었다가 나중에야 그 글자 위를 덮고 다시 「능(陵)」자로 고쳐 새겼다. 하지만 비석의 원래 재질과 글자를 메워넣은 재료의 재질이 서로 달라서 지금도 비가 오는 날에는 「능」이라는 글자 뒤에 가려진 「묘」자의 흔적이 드러난다고 한다.

그가 태어난 진천군에는 이미 신라 때부터 김유신사(金庾信祠)라는 사당이 있었는데 조선 시대까지 국가에서 제사를 지냈다. 임진왜란과 병자호란을 겪으면서 폐허가 된 것을 철종 2년(1851년) 백곡면에 '죽계사'를 세우고 김유신의 영정을 모셨으며, 서원철폐령으로 헐렸다가 1926년 김유신의 후손 김만희의 노력으로 지금의 자리에 길상사(吉祥祠)를 다시 세우게 되었다. 이곳은 1975년에 정비되었으며, 뒷산인 길상산은 다른 이름을 태령산(胎靈山)이라 하는데 김유신의 탯줄을 이 산의 봉우리에 묻었다는 데서 유래한 것이다.
경주에는 명종 18년(1561년)에 당시의 부윤 이정(李楨)이 김유신의 위패를 모시기 위해 지역 유생들과 함께 선도산 아래에 서악정사(西岳靜舍)를 세웠는데, 임진왜란으로 소실되었다가 1602년과 1610년에 걸쳐 사당과 강당, 동·서재를 새로 지었고, 인조 원년(1623년)에 국가가 인정한 사액서원으로서 '서악'이라는 이름을 받고 지금의 서악서원(西岳書院)으로 거듭나게 되었다. 이때 김유신에 더해 최치원과 설총을 더 배향하게 되었으며, 서원철폐령 때에도 폐쇄되지 않고 살아 남은 47개 서원 가운데 하나로 오늘날에 이르고 있다.
전국에 남아 있는 김유신을 제향하는 사묘는 다음과 같다.

전설
추남 설화: 김유신의 전생담
《삼국유사》에는 김유신이 국선(國仙)이 되었을 때, 고구려와 백제를 치려고 모의하던 중에 백석이란 낭도로부터 적국을 염탐하고 오자는 제의를 받아 밤에 길을 가던 중, 고개 위에서 우연히 세 명의 여자를 만나게 되었다. 서로 이야기를 나누다 친해졌을 즈음 유신으로부터 밤길의 목적을 듣고 여자들은 잠시 백석을 여기 두고 숲에서 긴히 할 이야기가 있다며 유신을 데리고 들어갔다. 그리고 그곳에서 여자들은 신의 모습으로 현신하여 유신에게 백석은 적국의 사람으로 유신을 꾀어 적지로 데려가려 한다며 경고한 뒤 사라졌다. 골화관에 이르러 유신은 백석에게 긴요한 문서를 잊고 왔다며 집으로 돌아온 뒤, 백석을 잡아 문초하여 그 이유를 알게 되었다. 백석의 말은 이러했다.
백석은 원래 고구려 사람으로, 영양왕때 고구려에서 국경의 강물이 역류하는 괴변이 생기자 고구려의 왕은 추남(楸南)이라는 복서지사(점쟁이)를 불러 점을 치게 했다. 추남은 「왕비가 음양의 도를 거스른 까닭에 이런 변고가 생겼다」는 점괘를 내놓았고, 노한 왕비는 왕에게 터무니없는 말이라며 다른 것으로 시험해 보아 맞지 않으면 추남을 중형에 처해야 한다고 주장했다. 고구려의 왕은 쥐 한 마리를 상자에 숨겨 놓고 추남에게 상자에 든 것을 맞히게 했는데, 추남은 상자 안에 쥐가 들어 있다고 말하면서 그 숫자는 한 마리가 아닌 여덟 마리라고 대답했다. 결국 처형당하게 된 추남은 죽음을 앞두고 ""반드시 다른 나라의 대장으로 환생해, 고구려를 멸망시키고 말겠다.""는 저주의 말을 남겼다. 그를 죽이고 나서 미심쩍은 생각이 든 왕이 쥐의 배를 갈라보게 했는데, 쥐의 뱃속에는 새끼가 일곱 마리 들어 있는 것이었다. 그제야 추남의 점이 사실임을 알았지만 이미 엎질러진 물이었다. 그 날 밤 고구려왕은 처형당한 추남이 신라 김서현의 부인의 품에 들어가는 꿈을 꾸었고, 추남이 신라에서 김유신으로 환생했다고 판단한 고구려왕과 그 신하들은 백석을 시켜 유신을 꾀어 죽이려 했던 것이다.
유신은 백석을 처형한 뒤 자신을 구해준 세 신들에게 제사지내어 그 은혜에 감사하였다고 한다. 그 세 신은 실은 내림·혈례·골화 세 지역의 신으로, 이후 신라에서는 국가 제사에서 시조묘나 종묘 다음으로 격이 높은 대사(大祀)로서 우대하였다.

김유신의 검
김유신의 전설 중 가장 유명한 것은 서라벌 중악(中嶽)에서 선인을 만나 신비로운 비법을 전수받고, 기도 수행하다 별의 정기가 서린 보검을 얻었다는 이야기이다. 《삼국사기》는 진평왕 건복 28년 신미(611년), 17세의 김유신이 중악의 동굴에 들어가 재계하고 하늘에 기도하였는데, 머문지 나흘째 되는 날 거친 털옷을 입은 한 노인이 나타나 「귀한 집의 자제가 어째서 여기에 혼자 있느냐」고 물었다. 김유신이 노인의 이름을 묻자 노인은 「나는 일정하게 머무르는 곳 없이 인연을 따라 가고 머물며 이름은 난승(難勝)이라 한다」고 소개했다.
그가 평범한 인물이 아님을 알게 된 김유신은 두 번 절하고 가르침을 청했다. 처음에는 묵묵히 말이 없던 난승은 김유신이 여러 번 간청하자 그제야 신비한 비법(秘法)을 가르쳐 주었다. 김유신에게 비법을 가르쳐주고 난 뒤, 「의롭지 못한 일에 쓴다면 도리어 재앙을 받을 것이니 함부로 전하지 말라」는 말을 마치고 난승과 김유신은 작별하였다. 그가 2리쯤 갔을 때 유신이 쫓아가 바라보니, 난승의 모습은 보이지 않고 산 위에는 오색의 찬란한 빛만 남아 있을 뿐이었다. 이듬해인 건복 29년(612년) 김유신은 다시 한 번 보검을 가지고 혼자서 열박산(咽薄山)의 깊은 골짜기에 들어가, 중악에서 했던 것처럼 향을 피우며 하늘을 향해 보검에 빛을 드리우고 신령을 내려줄 것을 기도했다. 사흘째 되는 밤, 허성(虛星)과 각성(角星) 두 별의 빛이 내려와 칼에 깃들었다. 이후 김유신의 검은 별의 정기를 품은 영검으로 거듭나게 되었다는 것이다.
오늘날 경주의 단석산에는 마치 칼로 잘라낸 듯 표면이 반듯반듯한 바위가 여기저기 남아있으며, 현지의 전승은 그것이 유신이 이곳에서 검술 수련을 하며 바위를 잘랐던 흔적이라고 말하고 있다. 또한 한국의 강릉에서 행해지는 강릉단오제는 김유신의 검이 명주(溟州) 남쪽의 선지사라는 절에서 90일 만에 주조되었다는 전승을 전하고 있는데, 김유신의 검은 그가 화를 낼 때마다 저절로 칼집에서 튀어나왔다고 한다. 이 검을 가지고 김유신은 백제와 고구려를 물리치고 마침내 삼한을 통일하는 대업을 이루었고 죽은 뒤 명주 대관령의 산신으로서 모셔지게 되었다고 전하고 있다. 단석산뿐 아니라 인근의 여러 산과 계곡, 동굴 등지에는 김유신과 관련된 전승을 전하는 곳이 많이 분포되어 있다.

백제의 공주와 작원성(鵲院城)
경주시 건천읍에는 작원성, 또는 작성(鵲城)이라는 토성이 남아 있는데, 《동경잡기》(東京雜記)에는 이 성의 이름 유래에 대해 다음과 같은 전설을 남기고 있다. 백제를 공격할 당시 김유신이 서라벌 왕궁에서 30리 가량 떨어져 있는 이곳에 주둔하였는데, 백제의 왕이 이 소식을 듣고 걱정하자, 둔갑술에 능하여 적이 쳐들어오면 저절로 싸우는 자용병기(自勇兵器)라는 신비한 무기를 부릴 줄 알았던 공주가 왕을 안심시키고자 자청해서 까치로 변신하여 이곳으로 날아왔다. 서쪽에서 날아온 까치 한 마리가 대장기 끝에 앉아 울자 군사들은 불길한 징조로 생각해 진중(陳中)이 크게 어수선해졌는데, 김유신이 허리에 차고 있던 장검을 빼들고 까치를 향해 겨누자, 까치는 땅에 떨어져 버렸고 그만 변신이 풀려 본래 모습으로 돌아오고 말았다. 이후 이 성의 이름을 까치 작(鵲) 자를 써서 작성, 또는 작원성이라 부르게 되었다.

김유신의 원령
《삼국유사》 미추왕죽엽군조에 보면 다음과 같은 이야기가 실려 있다. 신라 혜공왕(惠恭王) 14년(779년) 4월에 김유신의 무덤 위로 갑자기 회오리바람이 일어나더니, 회오리바람에 휩싸인 무장한 노인이 여러 병사를 거느리고 미추왕(味鄒王)의 능으로 들어갔다. 얼마 지나지 않아 무덤 안에서 탄식하고 통곡하는 소리와 함께 ""내가 살아서 평생 어지러운 것을 구제하였고 삼국을 통일한 공이 있었으며, 죽어 혼백이 되었어도 나라를 지키며 재앙을 없애고 어려움에서 구제하려는 마음에 조금도 변함이 없었는데, 지난 경술년(770년)에 내 자손이 아무 이유도 없이 죽임을 당했습니다. 이 나라의 왕과 신하, 그 누구도 더 이상 나의 공적을 생각해 주지 않으니, 나는 이제 멀리 다른 곳으로 옮겨가 더 이상 이 나라를 위해 애쓰지 않으렵니다. 대왕께서는 부디 허락해 주시기 바랍니다.""라는 목소리가 들렸고, 이에 미추왕의 무덤에서 ""나와 공이 이 나라를 지키지 않으면 저 백성들은 어떻게 되겠는가. 공은 다시 전처럼 힘써 주기 바라노라.""라고 대답했다. 노인이 미추왕릉을 향해 똑같은 요청을 세 번이나 더 했지만 세 번 모두 거절당했고, 혼령은 다시 김유신의 무덤으로 돌아갔다. 이것은 김유신의 영혼이 후손의 억울한 죽음을 원통해한 나머지, 신라 왕실(김씨)의 시조인 미추왕에게 항의하며 호소한 것이었다. 혜공왕은 이 소식을 듣고 두려워하면서 대신(大臣)인 김경신(金敬信)을 보내 김유신의 무덤에 사죄하게 하고, 김유신이 생전에 평양을 함락시킨 뒤 복을 빌기 위해 세웠던 절인 취선사(鷲仙寺)에 공덕보전(功德寶田) 30결을 내려 명복을 빌게 하였다고 한다.

당교(唐橋)
한국의 경상북도 상주시 함창읍과 문경시의 경계에 위치한 모전천이라는 강에는 당교(唐橋)라는 이름이 붙은 다리가 있었는데, 《삼국유사》는 《신라고전》(三國遺事)이라는 문헌을 인용해, 당군의 총관 소정방이 백제와 고구려를 공격하고 나서도 돌아가지 않고 신라를 멸망시키려는 계획을 품고 있자 이를 눈치챈 김유신이 이곳 당교에 당의 병사들을 불러놓고 연회를 베푸는 척 짐주(짐새 독을 넣은 술)를 먹여 독살해 파묻었다는 전설을 전하고 있다. 다만 이 전설에 대해서는 이를 수록한 일연 자신도 의문을 제기하며 신빙성이 없다고 부정하고 있다.

해석: 무장의 능력과 초월적 세계와의 관계성
《삼국유사》에는 신라 선덕여왕 때의 밀교승 밀본과 관련해서 주요 등장인물로 등장하는 설화가 수록되어 있으며, 《대동운부군옥》(大東韻府群玉)에 인용된 《신라수이전》(新羅殊異傳)의 다섯 설화 가운데 「노옹화구」(老翁化狗)와 「죽통미녀」(竹桶美女)는 김유신이 등장하는 설화이다.
김유신과 관련된 많은 설화와 전승들은 김유신이 생전 전장에서 보여준 전략, 전술적인 안목과 이를 통해 쌓아올린 승리담에 대한 경외에서 비롯되었다. 그것은 다분히 인간의 사고와 역량을 넘어서는 초인적인 것으로 다가왔고, 사람들로 하여금 김유신이라는 존재를 보통 인간의 기준치를 아득히 뛰어넘는 능력을 지닌 인간계 저너머(beyond) 초월적인 세계 어딘가의 존재 혹은 그러한 세계와 깊게 연결된 존재로 인식되게 했으며, 자연스럽게 김유신이라는 인간에 대한 영험한 신이담의 유포로 이어졌다는 것이다. 
집사랑 김장청의 《김유신행록》이 베이스가 된 《삼국사기》 열전 단계에서 김유신의 탄생과 사망에 이르는 일대기를 태몽, 비정상적 회임 기간, 사망 예언 등으로 비범함이 강조되나 그 존재 성격은 현실 세계의 테두리를 벗어나지 않는다. 삼국사 신라본기에서 열전으로, 다시 《삼국유사》로 갈수록 비현실성이 강화되며 《삼국유사》에서는 환생, 천상에서 하강, 다시 천상으로 복귀 등으로 현실과 비현실을 넘나드는 초월적 존재로 나타난다. 김유신에 관한 신이담들은 김유신이 불교적 천상세계의 현신이자, 도술 능력자 내지는 신비한 세계와 모종의 관계가 있음을 의미하고, 김유신 또한 그러한 능력의 소유자라는 인식을 표현한 것이라 해석할 수 있다. 이는 김유신이 신기한 도술을 부릴 수 있는(혹은 그런 쪽이랑 연관이 깊은) 인물이라는 인식이 민간에 널리 퍼져 있었음을 보여준다.
《동경잡기》에는 경주의 기우처 가운데 '김각간묘' 즉 김유신의 묘가 포함되어 있었고, 김유신의 어머니 만명 부인이 한국의 무속에서 '만명신'으로 모셔졌다는(《오주연문장전산고》) 전승들은 김유신의 도술적 능력이 그 어머니와 관련되어 있다는 인식이 무속에 전해져서인 것으로 보인다. 박찬흥은 김유신열전에서 김부식이 운운한 ""사대부는 물론이고 꼴 베고 나무하는 어린아이도 김유신의 이름을 안다""는 말은 상투적인 표현으로 약간의 과장도 섞여 있는 듯하지만, 이는 민간에서도 김유신이 신비로운 도술적 능력을 가진 존재로 널리 알려졌다는 점을 이렇게 표현했을 가능성도 있다고 지적하였다.

생애
초기
조선의 개국공신으로 영의정부사를 지낸 남재(南在)의 현손으로 의산군 남휘의 손자이다. 아버지는 군수 남빈(南份)이며, 어머니는 현감 홍여공(洪汝恭)의 딸이다. 후일 중종 때의 영의정을 지낸 남곤(南袞)은 그의 일족이다. 세조의 공신 권람의 딸과 결혼하였으나 부인 권씨는 요절했고, 권람도 일찍 죽었다. 재혼한 부인과 첩 2명이 더 있었으며, 재취 부인은 후일 그가 처형될 때 함께 처형되고 두 명의 첩은 남이의 옥사 직후 노비로 끌려갔다.
1460년(세조 6년) 무과(武科)에, 1466년(세조 12년)에 발영시(拔英試)에 급제했다.
1467년(세조 13년) 경기도 포천(抱川), 영평(永平) 등지의 길목에서 여행객과 상인들을 약탈하는 도적떼를 토벌했다.

이시애의 난과 여진족 토벌
1467년(세조 13년) 함경도 일대에서 이시애의 난이 일어났을 때 토벌대 대장이 되어 귀성군 준, 강순(康純), 어유소 등과 함께 토벌에 참여, 선봉으로 출정하였다. 그 뒤 출정 중 그의 훈공이 조정에 알려져 바로 당상관으로 승진하여 행 부호군(行副護軍)을 거쳐 행 호군이 되었다. 난이 평정된 뒤 적개공신(敵愾功臣) 1등관에 책록되고 의산군에 봉군되었다. 이어서 서북변에 출몰한 건주위(建州衛) 여진족을 정벌할 때에도 평안도선위사 윤필상의 지휘하에 우상대장이 되어 선봉으로 적진에 들어가 만포로부터 훈강(파저강)을 공격하여 여진족의 수괴 이만주 부자를 참살하고 되돌아왔다. 이러한 공로로 2등 군공에 책봉되었다.
그 뒤 공조판서를 거쳐 1468년(세조 14년)에는 오위도총부 도총관을 겸했으며, 그해 27세의 나이로 병조판서가 되었다. 그러나 세조가 죽자 한명회, 신숙주의 노골적인 견제를 받기 시작했다. 그해 남이의 승진과 세력 확장을 못마땅하게 여기며 견제하던 신숙주, 한명회 등이 이시애의 난 평정으로 등장한 신세력을 제거할 때 병조판서에서 해직되어 겸사복장(兼司僕將)으로 전임되었다.
한명회, 신숙주 등이 강희맹(姜希孟), 한계희(韓繼禧) 등의 훈구 대신들의 입을 통해 남이가 병조판서직을 수행할 능력이 없다고 비판하자, 예종은 그를 병조판서에서 해임하고 겸사복장직에 임명했다.

유자광과의 갈등
유자광은 서얼 출신이며 남이와 마찬가지로 이시애의 난에서 공을 세워 등용된 인물인데 모사에 능하고 계략에 뛰어난 인물이었다. 그런데 자신과 함께 공을 세운 남이가 세조의 사랑을 더 많이 받는 것을 시기하고 있다가 마침 남이가 병조에서 밀려나자 그를 완전히 제거해버릴 계획을 세웠다.

죽음
예종은 원래 남이를 좋아하지 않았다. 무예에 뛰어나고 성격이 강직할 뿐 아니라 아버지 세조의 사랑을 독차지하고 있던 그에 비하면, 예종은 정사 처리에도 능하지 않았으며 세조의 신뢰도 두텁지 않았다. 예종은 그 때문에 그를 시기하고 질투했다. 예종이 즉위한 지 얼마 안 된 1468년(세조 14년, 예종 원년) 어떤 사람이 그가 공주와 간음하였다고 소문을 날조하여 곤욕을 치렀는데, 그해 숙직을 서면서 혜성이 나타난 것을 보고 “묵은 것을 없애고 새것이 들어설 징조”라고 했다. 이것을 엿들은 유자광은 그가 영의정 강순 등과 모여 역모를 꾸민다고 모함하여 하옥되었다. 남이는 장인 권람의 친구들인 대신들에게 구명을 요청했지만 한명회와 신숙주는 이를 들어주지 않고 외면하였다. 권람의 아들들은 누이가 일찍 죽어서 예종 초 남이 집안과 아무런 관련도 교류도 없음을 들어 극적으로 멸문지화를 면하였다. 1468년 10월 27일 남이는 군기감 앞 저자거리에서 강순 등과 함께 효수당했다. 또한 그를 변호하던 조숙(趙淑) 등도 처형당했고, 그가 역모의 누명을 쓰고 처형되자 그의 모친 역시 연좌되어 상중에 고기를 먹고, 아들인 그와 간통하였다는 죄로 능지처사되었다.

사후
이 사건은 임진왜란 이전까지는 역모 사건이라고 인식되었지만, 그 이후 일부 야사에서는 유자광의 모함으로 날조된 옥사라고 규정하고 남이를 젊은 나이에 누명을 쓰고 억울하게 죽은 인물로 기술하고 있다는 점이 주목된다. 남이의 옥을 날조 사건으로 기록한 대표적인 책은 연려실기술인데 여기에는 유자광의 계략에 의한 것으로 되어 있다. 중종 때 조광조(趙光祖) 등에 의해 억울하게 희생된 점이 감안되어 복권 여론이 조성되었으나 기묘사화로 조광조 등이 숙청되면서 실패로 돌아갔다. 유자광에 의한 2차례의 처절한 사화로 유자광에 대한 사림의 평가가 극도로 절하됨으로써 남이의 역모는 억울한 누명으로 둔갑하게 되었다.
1818년(순조 18) 우의정 남공철의 주청으로 강순과 함께 관작이 복구되었다. 묘소는 경기도 화성시 비봉면 남전리에 있으며 창녕의 구봉서원(龜峯書院), 서울 용산의 용문사(龍門祠) 및 서울 성동의 충민사(忠愍祠)에 배향되었다.

백두산 돌은 칼을 갈아 다 없애리라
두만강 물은 말이 먹여 없애니
남아 이십에 나라를 평정하지 못하면
후세에 누가 대장부라 일컬으리오

그의 시 중에 “백두산 돌은 칼을 갈아 다 없애리라. 남자 20세에 나라를 평안히 못하면 후에 누가 대장부라 하리요.”라고 읊은 시가 유명하다. 후에 그의 이 시는 봉기나 데모대의 홍보물에 주로 이용되었다.
일제강점기에서 해방된 뒤 반탁시위에 김구(金九)는 친필로 6.23 반탁데모에 장군 남이가 지은 '남아 이십세에 나라를 평정하지 못한다면/후에 누가 대장부라 이르리'라는 시를 선사하여 격려하였다.

전해오는 이야기
축령산 전설
한국의 축령산은 경기도 남양주시 수동면과 가평군 상면 경계에 있는 축령산(886m)과 전라남도 장성과 전북 고창의 경계에 있는 축령산(620.5m)이 있는데 경기도 남양주시에 있는 축령산 이름의 유래는 남이와 관련된 것이다. 축령산에는 남이가 어릴 적 무예를 닦았다는 남이바위가 있고 정상에서 동쪽 방향으로 경기도 가평의 남이섬과 더불어 남이 장군 유래설이 근거가 빈약하지 않다.
유자광의 거짓 고변을 들은 예종이 스물여덟의 남이를 '거열형(車裂刑)'이라는 사지가 잘려나가는 형벌로 참혹하게 죽이자 이 지역 사람들이 그 영혼을 위로하고자 남이와 관련이 있는 이 산을 축령산으로 이름 지었다는 것이다. 잘 알려져 있지 않았지만 남이 장군 유래설이 더 친근감이 간다. 이밖에도 축령산에는 남이 장군이 무예를 닦았다는 남이바위가 있다.

남이 장군 묘소
경기도 화성시 비봉면 남전리에는 분명히 남이 묘소가 존재하는데 강원도 춘천의 남이섬에 가보면 남이섬의 이름이 유래된 남이장군의 묘소를 찾아 볼 수 있다. 역모를 꾀한다는 유자광의 모함으로 능지처참(거열형) 당한 남이 장군은 이곳 어딘가에 묻혔다는 전설이 전해져 온다. 전설에 담겨 전해져오는 돌무더기가 있어 이를 흙으로 덮어 봉분을 만들고 치장한 게 현재의 남이장군묘라 하는데 실제 남이 장군이 묻혀 있는지는 확인할 수 없다. 반역을 꾀하였던 무리들을 섬멸했다는 경상북도 영양의 '남이포'와 경기도 용인시 구성지역의 '남씨 가문에 내려오는 아기장군'에 대한 얘기도 남이 장군과 얽혀있다. 이렇듯이 현재 한국에는 남이에 대한 전설이 많다. 그만큼 스물여덟의 꽃다운 나이에 죽은 남이에 대한 안타까움이 설화같은전설이 되어 전해 내려오는 것이다.

무에서의 남이
박시백 화백의 역사만화 《조선왕조실록》에 의하면, 남이 장군이 청년 시절에 처녀를 괴롭히는 악한 귀신을 보고 쫓아내었다는 이야기가 있으며, 전설에 따라 귀신, 지네 등 다양한 상대를 한 것으로 전한다. 무속에서 남이 장군은 무당이 섬기는 장군신 중 한 분이다.

아기장수 설화
조선 초기의 명장 남이에 관한 인물전설로 《연려실기술》 · 《청야만집(靑野謾集)》 · 《대동기문(大東奇聞))에 문헌자료가 전해지고 있으며, 구전설화도 전국에 걸쳐 분포되어 있다. 문헌자료는 순수설화라기보다 여러 문집에 소재하여 있는 남이에 관한 기록을 인용한 것으로서 모두 같은 내용이다. 특기할 것은 《연려실기술》중 《국조기사(國朝記事)》의 자료를 인용한 남이의 결혼과정은 현재 구전되는 설화와 같은 것으로 보아 민간 전승을 기록한 것으로 볼 수 있다.

기타
가족 관계
그의 장인 권람은 한명회, 신숙주의 옛 동료이자 후일 계유정난과 세조반정을 함께 거사하던 동지였다. 그러나 부인 권씨가 일찍 죽고, 장인 권람도 1465년에 일찍 죽었으므로 그를 지원해 줄 인물이 없었다. 권람, 태종과는 이중 인척관계로 남이는 태종의 딸 정선공주의 손자이며, 장인 권람의 숙부 권규(權侊)는 태종의 다섯째 딸인 경안공주와 결혼하여 그 아들 권총은 태종의 외손이자, 그에게는 외종이모부가 된다. 김문기와도 사돈간으로 권총의 손녀 권영금은 김문기의 아들 김현석의 부인이다.

첩 탁문아
기생 출신 첩 탁문아(卓文兒)는 궁궐에서 베풀던 연회에도 나간 적이 있으므로 흥양군 신운은 그를 집안 노비로 부릴 수 없다 하여 관비로 정속되었다.

흥양군(興陽君) 신운(申雲)이 아뢰기를,
“전일(前日)에 하사받은 난신(亂臣) 남이의 첩 탁문아는 어전(御前)에서 정재(呈才)를 하던 자이므로, 신이 감히 가비(家婢)로써 부릴 수가 없습니다. 또 이 앞서 기생(妓生) 월중매(月中梅)와 초요갱(楚腰䡖) 등이 난신의 첩들로서 모두 다 본역(本役)에 그대로 정속(定屬)되었으니, 청컨대 이를 개정(改定)하소서.”
하니, 의금부와 장례원에 전지하기를,
“신운에게 하사해 준 기생 탁문아는 그대로 진해(鎭海) 관비(官婢)로 정속하라.”
하였다.

생애
생애 초반
1441년 8월 9일(음력 7월 23일) 단종은 당시 왕세자였던 문종과 왕세자빈이었던 현덕왕후의 외아들로 태어났으나 몸이 약한 현덕왕후가 단종을 낳은 지 하루 만에 산욕으로 세상을 떠났다. 모후가 죽자 어린 세손을 가련히 여긴 세종은 소헌왕후와 의논하여 자신의 후궁인 혜빈 양씨에게 어린 단종을 부탁했고, 세종의 후궁으로 조모뻘인 혜빈 양씨의 보살핌 아래에서 성장하였다.
1448년 8살이 되던 해에 왕세손으로 책봉된 단종은 할아버지 세종의 사랑을 듬뿍 받고 자랐다. 병중이었던 세종은 자신이 그리 길게 살지 못할 것을 예감하고 있었으며, 병약한 아들 문종 역시 오래 살지는 못할 것이라는 생각 때문에 늘 어린 손자 단종을 몹시 걱정했다. 문종마저 요절하고 나면 야심으로 가득찬 둘째 아들 수양대군을 비롯해 혈기왕성한 여러 대군 사이에서 어린 손자가 아무 탈 없이 잘 살아갈 수 있을지 걱정되었던 것이다. 그래서 생전에 황보인·김종서·성삼문·박팽년·신숙주 등에게 왕세손을 지켜줄 것을 부탁하였다.

즉위
세자와 즉위
1448년 왕세손으로 책봉되었고, 1450년 조부 세종대왕이 죽고 아버지 문종이 왕으로 즉위하자 바로 왕세자로 책봉되었다. 부왕 문종이 즉위하기 전 할아버지 세종은 세자 문종의 병약함과 수양대군, 안평대군 등의 아들들의 존재를 염려하여 집현전의 학사들에게 어린 손자를 부탁하는 말을 여러번 반복하였다. 성삼문 등은 세종의 뜻을 받들었지만, 신숙주 등은 수양대군의 측근이 되었다. 1452년(문종 2년) 4월 아버지 문종은 수양대군을 관습도감 도제조(慣習都監都提調)에 임명하였다. 그러나 수양대군은 야심을 철저히 숨기고 불사 중창과 법회에 참석하는 등 자신의 뜻을 철저히 감추었다. 그가 관습도감 도제조가 되자 사간원에서 종친에게 실직을 주는 것이 옳지 않다고 탄핵했으나, 문종이 듣지 않았다. 세종이 우려했던 대로 문종은 즉위한 지 겨우 2년 3개월 만에 병으로 승하하고 말았다.
단종은 문종의 뒤를 이어 1452년 6월 1일 (음력 5월 14일) 12살의 나이로 왕위에 올랐다. 어릴 때부터 세종의 칭찬이 자자했을 만큼 영리하였으나, 어린 나이에 즉위했으므로 혼자서 나랏일을 결정할 수가 없었다. 따라서 모든 결정은 의정부의 신하들이 도맡아 했고, 단종은 형식적인 결재를 하는 데 그쳤다. 특히 인사 문제는 고명대신들에 의한‘황표정사(黃票政事)'라는 방식으로 결정되었다. 어린 단종의 즉위 이래 정국이 불안해진 가운데 위축된 왕권과 달리 수양대군 등 종친의 세력은 나날이 팽창되어 갔다.

계유정난
수양대군은 종친의 대표로서 단종을 최측근에서 모실 수 있는 보호자라고 자처하였고, 비밀리에 측근 세력을 양성하여 왕위를 찬탈할 기회를 호시탐탐 엿보고 있었다. 그러던 중 안평대군 계열이 먼저 손을 쓰려는 움직임이 감지되자 1453년에 계유정난을 일으켰는데, 이때 그는 지나치게 비대해진 신권을 억압한다는 명분으로 조선의 왕족과 성리학자들의 지지를 획득했다. 이후 수양대군은 장악원 제조(掌樂院提調) 등을 역임하며 권력 기반을 다진다.
금성대군과 혜빈 양씨, 영풍군, 정종 등은 단종을 지키기 위해 노력하였다. 한편 문종의 후궁인 숙빈 홍씨 등은 정보를 훈신들에게 전달하기도 했다. 특히 수양대군과 안평대군의 세력 경쟁은 단종이 즉위한 지 1년 만인 1453년 음력 10월, 계유정난을 불러왔다.
1453년 10월 수양대군은 한명회·권람 등과 공모하여 홍윤성·홍달손 등의 병력을 동원함으로써, 문종의 고명(誥命)을 받아 단종을 보필하던 황보인·김종서·정분 등을 죽이고 10월 10일 아우 안평대군을 강화도에 유배시켰으며 스스로 영의정부사가 되어 정권을 완전히 장악하였다. 이어 1454년(단종 3년) 3월 논공행상을 정하여 정난공신을 책정하고 자신은 분충장의광국보조정책정난공신(奮忠杖義匡國輔祚定策靖難功臣) 1등관에 서훈하였다. 계유정난으로 수양대군이 실권을 완전히 장악하자 단종은 단지 이름뿐인 왕이 되고 말았다. 단종은 수양대군에 의하여 1457년 유배지인 영월에서 사사되었다.

단종 복위 운동
1454년에 수양대군이 금성대군을 비롯한 단종의 나머지 측근들을 모두 죄인으로 몰아 유배하는 일이 일어나자 계유정난을 계기로 일부 신료들은 단종이 양위해야 된다는 공론을 세웠고 이는 통과되었다. 1455년 7월 25일 (음력 윤 6월 11일), 단종은 수양대군의 측근 세력인 한명회·권람 등에게 선위를 강요받아 수양대군에게 왕위를 물려주고 상왕으로 물러나 수강궁 (상왕이 거처하는 곳)으로 옮겨갔다.
동시에 그의 유모이기도 했던 혜빈 양씨는 금성대군 등과 결탁하여 전횡을 휘둘렀다는 이유로 탄핵당하고 가산이 적몰된 뒤 청풍으로 유배를 갔다가 1455년 12월 17일(음력 11월 9일) 신하들의 여러 상소끝에 교수형으로 사망한다.
1456년 음력 6월에 성삼문(成三問)· 박팽년((朴彭年))· 이개(李塏) · 하위지(河緯地)· 유성원(柳誠源)· 김문기(金文起) 등 이른바 사육신이 단종의 복위를 꾀하다가 발각되어 처형되는 사건이 일어났다. 세조가 즉위한 이듬해(1456년)에 성삼문·유성원·하위지 등을 비롯한 집현전 학사 출신 관료들과 무인들은 연회때 별운검을 설치한 뒤 세조 3부자를 제거하고 단종의 복위를 꾀하려 계획을 수립하였다. 그러나 가담자의 한명인 김질이 자신의 장인 정창손에게 이를 말하고, 정창손의 설득에 의해 사육신의 정변 기도를 폭로하여 계획은 좌절되고 만다. 그 바람에 1457년 단종은 그 사건에 연루되었다는 혐의로 노산군(魯山君),즉 폐주로 강등되어 영월로 유배되었다.
1457년 9월 금성대군은 배소인 순흥에서 단종 복위 계획을 세운다. 금성대군, 순흥부사 이보흠 등이 또다시 단종 복위 사건을 일으키자 세조는 금성대군을 사사하고 단종도 같이 죽음을 내렸다. 또한 사육신과 관계된 여인과 재산을 공신의 노비로 분배하여 멸문시켰다.

최후
1457년 음력 10월 21일의 《세조실록》에는 단종이 16세의 어린 나이로 자살하였다고 기록되어 있는데, 중종 때까지 장례나 무덤도 제대로 못한 점으로 보아 세조실록의 기록은 거짓말이고 타살이 확실해보인다. 또한 선조실록에 기대승이 단종에게 사약을 내린 증거로, 의금부의 공사와 처형 당시 영월 주민들의 증언 기록을 내세운 것으로 보아 단종 이홍위가 사약을 받은 것은 확실해보인다. 《숙종실록》에는 의금부 도사 왕방연이 단종을 찾아가 차마 아무 말도 못하자, 그를 모시고 있던 자가 그를 해하였다고 한다. (교살당한 것으로 추정된다.) 단종이 죽자 아무도 그의 시신을 매장하지 못하였으나 영월군의 호장(戶長)인 엄흥도가 그의 시신을 수습하여 매장지를 찾던 중, 눈보라가 치던 곳에서 사슴이 앉았다가 사라진 곳을 보고 그 곳에 가매장하였다. 단종을 매장한 뒤 엄흥도는 가솔들을 이끌고 영월을 떠났다.
공적으로는 단종의 추모가 금기시되었지만 사망 직후 정보, 이수형 등은 복상하고 3년상을 치르기도 했다. 사후 무속에서 신으로 숭배되기 시작하였다. 한을 품고 사망하였으므로 단종은 무속의 신의 한 사람으로 모셔졌다. 영월군 군내면 영흥리(현, 영월군 영월읍 영흥리)에 세워진 단종의 사당 영모전 외에도 단종은 무속의 신 중 왕신의 한 사람으로 모셔졌다. 영흥11리 마을 서낭당과 양주 신혈면(현 서울 은평구) 지역의 일부 무속인은 단종을 무속의 신으로 모셨다.

복권
단종은 죽은 뒤 묘호도 없이 노산군으로 불리다가, 중종 때 사림에 의해 복권 논의가 나왔으나 거절당하였다. 사림의 한 갈래인 서인, 노론은 단종과 단종비 정순왕후 송씨의 복권을 주장하여 중종과 효종 때 단종의 복권 여론을 조성했다. 사망한 지 224년 만인, 1681년(숙종 7) 7월 숙종의 특명으로 노산대군(魯山大君)으로 추봉되고, 1698년(숙종 24년) 11월 6일에 복위되어 묘호를 단종이라 하였다. 단종의 묘소 역시 단종이 폐위되었으므로 공식적으로는 노산군묘였으나, 시중에서는 노릉(魯陵)이라 불렀다. 단종이 노산군에서 노산대군으로, 노산대군에서 다시 단종으로 복권되면서 묘호 역시 정식으로 장릉으로 격상되었다.

능묘
단종은 1457년 16세의 나이로 사약을 받고 죽은 이후 가매장되었다가, 59년 후인 중종 11년 1516년 12월 15일에야 봉분을 갖추게 되었다.
능은 영월에 있는 장릉(莊陵)이다. 강원특별자치도 영월군 영월읍에 소재하고 있으며, 1970년 5월 26일 사적 제 196호로 지정되었다. 경국대전에 명시된 사대문 밖 80리 이내에서 벗어난 능 중의 하나이며, 다른 능과 달리 단종에게 충절을 한 여러 신하들을 장릉에 배향하기 위해 장릉 밑에 충신단이 설치되어 있다.

기타
동학사
사육신과 생육신을 비롯한 관련자 및 단종폐위에 분개하여 관직을 버리거나, 관직에 나가지 않은 인물들을 모신 사당이 충청남도 공주군 반포면 학봉리(현 공주시 반포면)에 세워졌다. 동학사 내 숙모전(肅慕殿)에 단종과 신하들의 위패가 봉안되었으며, 동학사는 1984년 5월 17일 충청남도문화재자료 제67호로 지정되었다.

싸리재
단종이 강원도 영월군의 청령포로 유배를 올 때 여주시-원주시 부론면-귀래면-신림면의 싸리재를 거쳐서 영월로 왔다. 이 때 단종은 관리 3명과 군졸 50명의 후송을 받았다고 한다. 싸리재는 또한 의병장 김상태의 활약으로도 유명한데, 호좌의진이라는 의병 부대의 중군부대를 이끌던 그는 영천의 조령, 문경의 갈평, 원주 싸리재에서 벌어진 전투에 참여했다고 한다.

무속에서 신격화된 단종
민간과 무속에서 군왕신(君王神)의 하나로 모셔진다. 노산군지신(魯山君之神)이라고도 부른다. 영월읍에 있는 영모전(永慕殿) 서낭당을 비롯하여 영월·정선군, 삼척시 등 태백산 인근의 무속에서 신으로 받들고 있다. 그밖에 양주군 신혈면 지역에도 단종을 무속의 신으로 모시는 무가가 일부 있다.

생애
출생에서 즉위까지
출생
《삼국사기》는 왕이 681년 음력 7월 1일에 승하했다고만 했을 뿐 왕이 언제 태어났는지, 사망 당시의 나이가 몇 살이었는지에 대해서는 기록하고 있지 않다. 그러나 신라 당대 금석문인 『문무대왕비』에 따르면 왕이 승하할 당시의 나이가 56세였다고 기록되어 있으며, 이를 토대로 추산하면 문무왕의 생년은 진평왕 건복 43년(626년)에 해당한다.

출생 설화
《삼국사기》에는 출생에 대한 다음과 같은 설화가 전해진다.

즉위까지
진덕여왕 4년(650년)에 당에 사신으로 파견돼 고종에게 〈치당태평송〉(致唐太平頌)을 바쳤다. 고종은 이를 가상히 여겨 법민에게 태부경(太府卿)이라는 벼슬을 내렸다. 654년 아버지 김춘추가 진덕여왕의 뒤를 이어 왕위에 오른 뒤 파진찬으로써 병부령직에 임명되었다. 655년 태자로 봉해졌다. 태종무열왕 7년(660년) 나·당 연합군이 백제를 칠 때, 김유신과 함께 5만 군사를 거느리고 백제의 사비성을 점령하였다. 이어 태종무열왕 8년(661년) 부왕이 승하하자 곧 즉위하였다.

치세
백제 부흥운동 진압
원년(661년) 6월 상중(喪中)이던 문무왕에게 당은 고구려를 치는 당군과 웅진도독부에 고립된 당군에 군수물자를 지원하고 신라가 백제 부흥군(復興軍)을 진압하는데 나서줄 것을 거듭 요청해왔다. 평양으로 먼저 군량을 보내면 웅진으로 통하는 물자 수송로가 끊어질 것이고, 그 수송로가 끊어지면 웅진도독부의 당군들은 백제군에게 궤멸될 것이라는 판단을 내린 왕은 8월에 직접 여러 장수를 거느리고 시이곡정(始飴谷停)으로 향했다. 그 길목에 있는 옹산성(甕山城)에 주둔하고 있던 백제 부흥군을 9월 25일부터 공격하기 시작해 27일에 함락시켰다. 옹산성을 함락시키고 웅현성(熊峴城)을 쌓아 웅진도독부로 통하는 군량수송로를 다시 개통시킨 뒤, 상주(上州) 총관(摠管) 품일(品日)과 일모산군(一牟山郡) 태수 대당(大幢)·사시산군(沙尸山郡) 태수 철천(哲川) 등이 이끄는 군사들이 우술성(雨述城)을 쳐서 또 함락시키고, 10월 29일에 서라벌로 돌아와 당의 조문 사절을 맞이했다.

한편 평양을 포위하고 있던 소정방이 보낸 함자도(含資道) 총관(摠管) 유덕민(劉德敏)이 와서 문무왕에게 당군에 대한 군량 지원을 요청하였다. 왕은 이듬해 1월 김유신으로 하여금 수레 2천여 대에 쌀 4천 섬과 조(租) 2만 2천여 섬을 싣고 평양으로 가게 하였다. 이들 군은 이듬해 2월에 무사히 군량을 전달하고 귀환하였다.
2년(662년) 봄 정월에 당은 문무왕을 개부의동삼사(開府儀同三司) 상주국(上柱國) 낙랑군왕(樂浪郡王) 신라왕으로 책봉했다. 2월에는 탐라국 임금 도동음률(徒冬音律)이 항복해 와 신라의 속국이 되었다. 이때 신라에서는 백제에 주둔하고 고구려를 치는 당군의 요청이 들어올 때마다 식량을 보내고 옷을 보내고 하느라 창고에 쌓아둔 양식은 고갈되고, 농사 때를 망쳐 백성들이 풀뿌리도 오히려 부족할 지경이었지만, 반대로 웅진도독부에 있는 당군의 군량 창고에는 쌀이 남아돌다 못해 썩어나고 있었고 웅진도독부에서는 그 뒤로도 수시로 신라에 군량을 요구하였다. 3월에 내린 대사면령은 이러한 가운데서 오는 민심이반을 막기 위한 것이었다고 추정된다. 7월 왕은 왕제(王弟) 인문(仁門)을 사신으로 당에 보내는 한편, 웅진도독부의 당군은 지라성(支羅城)과 윤성(尹城), 대산(大山)과 사정(沙井)의 백제 목책을 깨뜨리고 신라군과 합세해 진현성(眞峴城)을 공격해 함락시키고 신라의 군량수송로를 열었다. 8월에는 흠순 등 19장군을 시켜 내사지성(內斯只城)의 백제 부흥군을 깨뜨렸고, 대당(大幢) 총관(摠管) 진주(眞珠)와 남천주(南川州) 총관 진흠(眞欽)이 병을 핑계로 한가로이 지내며 나랏일을 돌보지 않는다는 죄를 물어 처형하고 그 일족까지 멸했다.
3년(663년) 봄 정월에는 서라벌 근교의 남산신성(南山新城)에 장창(長倉)을 지었다. 또한 부산성(富山城)을 쌓았다. 이보다 앞서 백제 부흥군은 662년 12월에 험준한 주류성(周留城)에서 주변에 평야와 강이 많은 피성(避城)으로 수도를 옮겼는데, 663년 2월에 흠순과 천존은 백제 거열성을 쳐서 빼앗고 거물성과 사평성을 공격하여 항복시켰으며, 덕안성을 쳐서 1,070명을 목베는 등 백제 부흥군을 더욱 압박해왔다. 결국 부흥군은 피성을 떠나 주류성으로 돌아갔고, 왕은 이미 백제를 평정하였다며 유사에 명해 큰 잔치를 베풀고 술과 음식을 내려 주게 한다. 한편 여름 4월, 당은 신라를 계림대도독부(雞林大都督府)로 삼고, 문무왕을 계림주대도독(雞林州大都督)으로 삼았다. 6월, 백제 부흥군 내의 내분으로 복신이 풍왕에게 살해당한 것을 계기로 신라는 곧장 백제 부흥군을 쳐서 진압하려 했고, 당에서도 웅진도독부의 장군 유인궤(劉仁軌)의 요청에 따라 우위위장군(右威衛將軍) 손인사(孫仁師)가 40만 군사를 보냈고, 유인궤와 별장(別將) 두상(杜爽), 새로 백제왕으로 임명된 부여융 등의 수군은 덕물도(德物島)를 경유해 수로로 곧장 웅진부성(熊津府城)으로 나아갔다. 문무왕 역시 김유신과 김인문·김천존, 화랑 죽지랑을 위시한 28명(또는 30명)의 장군을 데리고 당의 손인사·유인원과 군사를 합쳐 8월 13일에 두솔성(豆率城)을 함락했다. 문무왕은 왜인들에게 훈계하고 본국으로 돌려보냈다. 28일에는 백강 어귀에서 당의 수군과 백제·왜의 선단이 충돌한 네 번의 싸움 모두 백제·왜 선단의 궤멸로 끝났고, 백제의 풍왕은 몇 사람과 함께 배 한 척에 의지해서 고구려로 망명해 버렸다(백강구 전투). 요충지인 가림성을 제치고 먼저 주류성을 치기로 결정한 나·당 연합군 지휘부는 9월 7일에 마침내 주류성을 함락시켰다. 웅진도독부의 당군에게 의복을 공급해주고 겨울 11월 20일에 서라벌로 돌아와, 문무왕은 여러 장수들에게 논공행상을 행했다. 앞서 당은 신라와의 합의 없이 일방적으로 신라를 계림대도독부로 삼고 문무왕을 도독에 임명한 뒤, 임존성을 함락시키지 못하고 돌아오려는 문무왕을 향해 ""평정을 마친 뒤 함께 모여 맹약을 맺으라""던 고종의 칙령을 들며 두 나라 사이의 맹약을 제의했다. 신라는 임존성이 함락되지도 않은 상황에서 너무 이르다는 이유로 거절했지만, 결국 문무왕 4년(664년) 2월에 각간 김인문, 이찬 천존(天存)을 보내어 당의 칙사 유인원(劉仁願)과 새로 웅진도독이 된 옛 백제의 왕자 부여융과 웅진에서 동맹을 맺었다. 백제 부흥군은 문무왕 4년(664년) 3월에 사비산성(泗沘山城)에서 최후의 저항을 시도했지만 그마저도 실패로 돌아가면서 백제 부흥은 사실상 종말을 고한다.

고구려 정복
백제의 사비성을 함락시킨 문무왕이 처음으로 고구려 정복에 나선 것은 문무왕 4년(664년) 가을 7월, 왕제 김인문과 김품일, 한산주(漢山州) 도독(都督) 김군관, 수약주(首若州) 총관(摠管) 김문영 등에게 일선(一善)·한산 두 주의 군사를 이끌고 웅진도독부 소속 당병과 함께 돌사성(突沙城)을 쳐서 멸하면서부터였다.
5년(665년) 가을 8월에 왕은 당의 칙사 유인원, 웅진도독 부여융과 함께 웅진 취리산에서 모여 다시 맹약을 맺었다. 백마를 잡아 그 피를 마시고 “서로의 경계를 넘어 침범하지 않는다”는 내용을 골자로 한 맹약의 글은 유인궤가 지은 것으로 제물들은 취리산 제단의 북쪽에 묻고, 맹약문은 신라의 종묘에 보관되었다. 또한 그 회맹한 지점을 백제와 신라의 경계로 삼고 푯말을 세워 백제와 신라 양국의 국경으로 삼았다. 이는 전쟁이 끝난 뒤 평양 이남의 땅은 신라에 귀속된다는 당초의 약속을 어긴 당의 일방적이고 독단적인 처사였다. 같은 달, 왕자 정명(훗날의 신문왕)을 태자로 책봉하였다. 겨울에는 일선·거열 두 주의 백성들을 시켜 군수물자를 하서주로 운반하게 하면서 고구려와의 전쟁을 준비했다.
6년(666년) 4월에는 대신 김천존의 아들인 나마 한림과 김유신의 아들인 나마 삼광(三光)을 모두 당에 들어가 숙위하게 하였으며, 고구려를 없애고자 당에 군사를 요청하였다. 12월에부터 당은 이적(李勣)을 요동도행군대총관(遼東道行軍大摠管)으로 삼고 사열소상백(司列少常伯) 안륙현(安陸縣) 사람인 학처준(郝處俊)을 부장으로 삼아 고구려와 전쟁을 벌였는데, 이때 고구려는 실권자였던 대막리지 연개소문의 죽음에 이어 그의 아들들 사이에 형제 다툼이 벌어졌고, 이는 마침내 연개소문의 장남 남생이 아우 남건과 남산에게 쫓겨 국내성 등의 성을 거느리고 당에 항복해버리면서 고구려 지배층의 내분으로까지 번지게 되었다. 이 와중에 연개소문의 아우 정토가 24명의 부하와 12성 763호 3,543명을 거느리고 항복해오자, 정토와 그의 부하들에게 옷과 양식, 집을 주어 서울 및 주·부에 안주시키고, 온전한 여덟 성에는 군사를 보내 지키게 한다.
7년(667년) 7월에 3일 동안 큰 잔치를 베풀었고, 당에서는 신라의 장군 지경(智鏡)과 개원(愷元)을 장군으로 발탁하고 대아찬 일원(日原)은 당의 운휘장군(雲麾將軍)으로 임명되었는데, 문무왕은 지경과 개원에게 각각 파진찬과 대아찬의 관등을 주고, 일원을 운휘장군으로 명한다는 고종의 칙명은 왕궁 뜰에서 받도록 명하였다. 또한, 같은 달 고종은 유인원과 신라의 김인태(金仁泰)에게 명하여 비열성(卑列城)의 길을 따라, 신라 병사를 징발해 다곡(多谷)·해곡(海谷) 두 길을 따라 평양으로 모이도록 하였다. 가을 8월에 문무왕은 대각간 김유신 등 30명의 장군을 거느리고 서라벌을 출발해 9월에는 한성정(漢城停)에 도착해 이적(李勣)과 합류하기 위해 기다렸다. 이때 신라군은 당군을 배제한 단독 작전수행 대신 정탐을 세 번이나 보내면서 배를 계속 띄워 당군의 동정을 살폈고, 당군이 아직 평양에 도달하지 않았음을 알고 먼저 고구려의 칠중성(七重城)을 쳐서 먼저 고구려로 갈 길을 뚫기로 했다. 하지만 칠중성을 치기 전, 겨울 10월 2일에 평양성 북쪽 2백리 지점에 도착한 이적은 신라측 이동혜(尒同兮) 촌주(村主) 대나마 강심(江深)에게 부쳐, 한성에 주둔하고 있던 신라군에게 “칠중성을 공격할 필요없이 곧바로 평양으로 와서 당군에 군량을 공급하라”는 편지를 보내왔다. 이에 신라군은 칠중성 공격을 포기하고 수곡성(水谷城)으로 향했지만, 11월 11일에 장새(獐塞)에 이르렀을 때 이적은 어느새 돌아가버렸고, 신라군도 그냥 돌아왔다. 12월에 당은 다시 웅진도독부의 유진장군(留鎭將軍) 유인원을 보내어 고구려 정벌을 돕게 하면서 문무왕에게 대장군의 정절(旌節)을 주었다.
8년(668년) 2월 이적 등이 이끄는 당군이 고구려의 부여성을 비롯한 40여 성을 함락시켰다. 이에 남건이 5만의 군사로 그 땅을 수복하려 애썼지만 설하수(薛賀水)에서 3만 명이 죽는 대패를 당하고 퇴각했다. 3월에 신라는 북방의 요충지였던 비열홀(比列忽, 비열성)에 주를 설치하고 파진찬 용문(龍文)을 총관으로 삼았다. 6월 12일에 당의 우상(右相) 유인궤가 당 고종의 칙명을 받들고 신라의 숙위 사찬 김삼광과 함께 당항진(党項津)에 도착하자 왕은 각간 인문을 보내 성대한 예식으로 맞이하게 했다. 이에 유인궤는 약속을 마치고 신라의 선발군을 이끌고 고구려 땅인 천강(泉岡)으로 향하고, 문무왕 역시 6월 21일에 한성주에서 후발부대를 사열했다. 이때 신라군의 주요 장수들의 명단은 다음과 같다.

이때 대당대총관으로 임명된 대각간 김유신은 풍병(風病) 때문에 전투에 직접 참가하지는 못하고 수도 서라벌에 남았고, 일찍이 백제를 치는데 선두로 나섰던 여러 장수들이 모두 지도부의 요직을 맡아 고구려 공격에 나서게 되었다. 임명된 관직으로 추정한 진격루트는 한성주(한산주)와 비열주(비열홀주) 그리고 하서주(하슬라주) 세 곳으로, 수도 서라벌에서 조직된 군사들은 닷새 후 북쪽을 향해 출발했다. 6월 22일에 유인원이 신라의 귀간(貴干) 미힐(未肹)을 보내어 고구려의 대곡성(大谷城)과 한성(漢城) 등 2군 12성이 항복해왔음을 알렸고, 신라군 장수인 인문·천존·도유 등은 일선주 등 일곱 군과 한성주의 병마를 이끌고 당의 군영으로 나아갔다. 6월 27일에는 드디어 문무왕 자신이 서라벌을 출발했고, 이틀 뒤에는 여러 도의 총관들이 일제히 출발했다. 당군 총사령관 이적을 만난 신라의 김인문은 고구려의 평양 북쪽 20리 되는 지점인 영류산(嬰留山) 아래까지 진군하였다.
7월 16일에 한성에 도착한 왕은 여러 총관들에게 당군과 회합할 것을 명했다. 한편 비열성주행군총관 김문영 등은 사천(蛇川)의 벌판에서 고구려의 태대막리지 남건이 거느리고 온 군사와 충돌했는데, 함께 있던 당의 번병들이 제대로 싸우지도 못하는 와중에 김문영의 신라군은 앞으로 나서서 고구려군과 맞서 크게 이겼고, 신라군이 이기는 것을 보고 난 다음에야 당병은 겨우 고구려군과 싸웠다고 한다. 이 사천에서의 싸움에서 공을 세운 대당소감(大幢小監) 본득(本得)은 훗날 문무왕에 의해 일길찬 관등과 조 1천 섬을 은상으로 받았고, 전사한 한산주소감(漢山州小監) 김상경(金相京)도 그와 준하는 상이 내려졌다. 다만 아술(牙述)의 사찬 구율(求律)은 다리 아래로 내려가 물을 건너가서 적과 싸워 크게 이겼음에도, 군령을 받지 않고 스스로 위험한 곳에 들어갔다 하여 포상에서는 제외되었다.
9월 21일에 신라군은 당군과 합류해 평양성을 에워쌌다. 고구려의 보장왕은 먼저 연남산(淵男産) 등 98명의 수령(首領)을 이끌고 백기를 들고 항복했고, 신라군의 대당총관 김인문이 보장왕을 이적 앞에 데려가 꿇어앉히고 그 죄를 세었다. 남건은 성문을 닫고 항거하면서, 병력을 내보내 싸웠으나 모두 패하였다. 9월 26일 승려 신성(信誠)이 성문을 여니 신라의 5백 기병을 필두로 한 군사들이 평양으로 들어가 평양을 함락시켰다. 이때 평양성 함락전에서의 신라군의 활약은 기록에 잘 드러나 있지 않지만, 평양성을 함락하고 한 달이 지난 뒤에 문무왕이 남한주에서 행한 논공행상 과정이 남아있다. 평양성 외곽에서는 흑악령(黑嶽令) 선극(宣極)이 평양성 대문에서의 싸움에 세운 공으로 일길찬의 관등과 조(租) 1천 섬을 받았고, 군사(軍師)인 남한산(南漢山)의 북거(北渠)는 평양성 북문에서 전공을 세워 술간(述干) 관등과 벼 1천 섬, 부양(斧壤)의 구기(仇杞)는 평양 남쪽 다리 위에서 높은 공을 세워 마찬가지로 술간 관등과 벼 700섬을 받았다. 평양성 내부에서는 임시[假] 군사(軍師)인 비열홀의 세활(世活)이 평양의 소성(小城)에서 전공을 세워 고간(高干) 관등과 벼 500섬을 받았고, 서당당주(誓幢幢主) 김둔산(金遁山)은 평양 군영에서의 전공이 으뜸이라 하여 사찬 관등과 조 700섬을 받았으며, 한산주 소감 박경한(朴京漢)은 평양성 안에서 고구려의 군주(軍主) 술탈(述脫)을 죽인 공으로 일길찬 관등과 조 1천 섬을 받았다.
평양성이 함락된 뒤 이적은 보장왕과 왕자 복남(福男)·덕남(德男) 그리고 대신 등 20여만 명을 이끌고 돌아갔고, 각간 김인문과 대아찬 조주(助州)가 이적을 따라 인태·의복·수세·천광·흥원 등과 함께 당으로 들어갔다. 문무왕은 한성을 출발해 평양성으로 가던 중, 힐차양(肹次壤)에 이르러 당의 여러 장수가 이미 돌아갔다는 말을 듣고 한성으로 되돌아왔다. 신라 측은 긴 전쟁이 끝나고 자신들에게 약속된 은택을 얻을 것이고 공을 세운 장군들도 포상을 받게 될 것이라 기대하고 당나라에 들어갔지만, 당의 총사령관 이적은 “지금 신라는 아무도 공이 없다”며 싸늘한 태도를 보였고, 이적의 태도가 신라 군영에 전해지면서 신라군들은 동요하기 시작했다. 신라로서는 그들의 국가적인 힘을 기울여 당군을 도와 주변의 적들을 쓰러뜨렸는데, 막상 신라에게 돌아온 보상은 아무것도 없었던 것이다. 오히려 당은 백제와 고구려에 이어 신라까지 집어삼키려 하고 있었다.
남한주(南漢州)로 돌아온 문무왕은 10월 22일에 논공행상을 벌여 서라벌에 남아있던 김유신에게 태대서발한(太大舒發翰)의 직위와 식읍 500호, 궤장을 하사하고 그의 모든 보좌관들에게도 각각 위계 한 등급씩을 올려 주었다. 또한 인문을 대각간, 다른 이찬과 장군들을 모두 각간으로 삼고 소판 이하에게는 모두 관위 1등급씩 더해주었다. 10월 25일에 왕은 욕돌역(褥突驛)에 이르러 국원사신(國原仕臣) 용장(龍長) 대아찬에게 사적으로 대접받았다. 전쟁에서 포로로 잡은 고구려 사람 7천 명을 포로로 거느리고 11월 5일에 서라벌로 들어온 왕은 다음날 문무 관료들과 함께 선조묘에 전쟁이 끝났음을 고하고, 11월 18일에는 전사자들의 신분에 맞춰 부의(賻儀)를 내렸다.

나당 전쟁에서 삼국 통일까지
9년(669년) 5월 천정군(泉井郡)·비열홀군(比列忽郡)·각련군(各連郡) 세 군의 백성이 굶주렸으므로 창고를 열어 진휼하였다. 같은 달, 급찬 기진산(祇珍山) 등을 당에 보내어 자석(紫石) 두 상자를 바쳤다. 또한 각간 김흠순과 파진찬 김양도(金良圖)를 당에 보내 사죄하게 하였다. 겨울에는 당의 사신이 도착하여 신라의 쇠뇌 기술자인 사찬 구진천(仇珍川)을 당에 데려갔다. 이는 당시 ‘천보노(千歩弩)’라고까지 불리며 쏘면 1천 보를 나간다는 소문이 퍼져 있던 신라의 쇠뇌 제작 기술을 확보하기 위해서였다.
같은 해 문무왕은 말을 기르는 목장 174곳을 소내(所內)에 22곳, 관청에 10곳을 속하게 하고 김유신을 비롯한 고위 진골 대신들과 여러 관료들에게 나누어 주었다. 또한 백제의 여자를 아내로 삼은 한성도독 박도유가 웅진도독부와 내통해 신라의 병기를 훔쳐다 한 주(州)의 땅을 습격하는 난을 일으키려다 계획이 발각되어, 도유는 처형당했다.
10년(670년) 봄 정월, 당 고종은 신라의 사신 김흠순에게는 귀국을 허락하였지만 김양도는 억류하여 감옥에 가두었는데 마침내 감옥에서 죽었다. 이것은 신라가 백제의 땅과 유민을 취한 데 대한 보복 조치였다. 3월, 사찬 설오유(薛烏儒)가 고구려 태대형 고연무와 함께 각각 병사 1만 씩을 거느리고 압록강을 건너서 옥골(屋骨)에 이르렀다. 4월 4일 개돈양(皆敦壤)에 주둔하고 있던 말갈족과의 전투에서 승리를 거둔다. 이후 당나라가 병력을 지속적으로 충원하자 백성(白城)으로 후퇴했다. 6월에는 고구려 대형(大兄) 검모잠이 당나라 관리와 승려 법안(法安) 등을 죽이고 신라로 향하였다. 검모잠은 안승(보덕왕)을 왕으로 추대하고 신라에 충성을 약속했다. 문무왕은 이들을 금마저(金馬渚)에 머물게 하였다. 7월, 백제의 남은 세력이 배반할까 의심하여 대아찬 김유돈(金儒敦)과 옛 백제의 주부(主簿) 수미(首彌)·장귀(長貴)를 웅진도독부로 보내, 신뢰 차원에서 양측간의 인질 교환을 제의했다. 웅진도독부는 이에 응하면서도 한편으로는 군사와 말을 모아 신라군에 대한 야간 기습을 수차례 반복했다. 한편 김흠순 등이 귀국해 당에서 가져온 지도를 바쳤는데, 그 지도는 신라가 차지하게 되어있던 옛 백제령을 모두 백제(웅진도독부)에 돌려주도록 하는 것이었다. 신라는 이를 빌미로 앞서 웅진도독부에서 파견한 백제의 사마(司馬) 예군(禰軍)을 첩자의 혐의를 물어 억류하고, 군사를 일으켜 웅진도독부를 쳐서 땅을 빼앗았다. 이때 신라 장수들 중 싸우지 않고 퇴각한 이들도 있었는데, 이들에 대해서는 특별히 처벌 대신 면직으로 매듭지었다. 같은 달, 사찬 수미산(須彌山)을 보내 안승을 고구려 왕으로 ‘책봉’했다. 12월, 한성주(漢城州) 총관(摠管) 수세(藪世)가 반란을 도모하려 하자, 대아찬(大阿湌) 진주(眞珠)를 보내 목을 베었다.
11년(671년) 군사를 일으켜 웅진도독부를 침공하였다. 당의 지휘를 받던 말갈병이 설구성(舌口城)을 포위했다가 물러가는 것을 후방에서 쳐서 3백 명을 죽이고, 당군이 백제를 구원하러 올 것에 대비해 대아찬 진공(眞功) 등을 시켜 수군으로 옹포(甕浦)를 지키게 했다. 또한 6월에 장군인 화랑 죽지 등을 시켜 군사를 거느리고 백제 가림성(加林城)의 벼를 짓밟게 했으며, 당병과 석성(石城)에서 싸워 5,300명을 죽이고 백제 장군 두 명과 당의 과의(果毅) 여섯 명을 사로잡는 전과를 거두었다. 7월에 당은 행군총관 설인귀를 신라에 파견했는데, 왕은 사신을 맞아 위로하는 대신 강가의 풀이 우거진 낮은 언덕에 군사를 숨기고 강 어귀에는 무기를 감춰둔 채, 수풀 사이를 오가며 틈을 노려 기습할 준비를 하고 있었다. 설인귀는 26일에 당이 신라를 도와서 백제와 고구려를 멸해주었는데 신라가 그 은혜를 잊고, 고구려를 도와 당을 치고 있다며 항의하는 내용과 함께 마음만 먹으면 당이 신라를 집어삼킬 수도 있음을 은근히 협박하는 내용의 편지를 적어 법사 임윤(琳潤)을 시켜 왕에게 보냈다. 문무왕은 설인귀에게 신라가 선왕 때로부터 당에 협조하고 여러 번 신라의 백성이 헐벗고 굶주리는 지경이 되는 것도 마다하지 않고 국고를 내어 번번이 당군을 지원했던 사실과 당이 처음 신라와 했던 약속들을 어기고 신라가 점령하여 지배하던 땅을 무단으로 거둬들인 일을 비난하며 자신의 입장을 표명하였다. 같은 날, 백제 수도였던 사비성에 소부리주(所夫里州)를 설치하고 아찬 진왕(眞王)을 도독으로 삼았다. 10월 6일 당의 조운선(漕運船) 70여 척을 공격하여 낭장(郞將) 겸이대후(鉗耳大侯)와 병사 100여 명을 사로잡는 등 큰 전과를 올렸다.

12년(672년) 당나라는 대군을 동원해 신라에 대한 침략을 개시했다. 이에 맞서 신라는 봄 정월에 백제 고성성(古省城)을 쳐서 이기고, 2월에는 다시 백제의 가림성 공격을 시도했다. 7월, 당나라 장수 고간(高侃)의 한병(漢兵) 1만, 말갈족 출신의 이근행이 거느린 말갈병 3만이 함께 평양에 이르러 여덟 곳에 군영(軍營)을 설치하고 머물렀다. 이들은 8월부터 한시성(韓始城)과 마읍성(馬邑城)을 쳐서 이기고 백수성(白水城) 5백 보 거리까지 전진해 주둔하는 등 신라 땅을 침식해왔다. 신라는 고구려 부흥군과 연합해 이들을 쳐서 이기고, 추격하는 당병을 석문(石門) 벌판까지 뒤쫓아가 싸웠지만, 군 내부에서의 논공행상 및 전략에 대한 견해차로 분열된 사이에 당병의 반격을 받아 크게 패하고 대아찬 효천(曉川), 사찬 의문(義文)·산세(山世), 아찬 능신(能申)·두선(豆善), 일길찬 안나함(安那含)·양신(良臣) 등이 죽었다. 태대각간 김유신의 아들인 원술도 여기에 참전했다가 목숨을 건져 돌아왔는데, 아버지 유신은 자신의 아들을 군법으로 처형해야 한다며 왕에게 아뢰었으나 왕은 듣지 않았다. 한편 각자 맡은 곳을 지키며 방어전으로 전략을 변경하자는 유신의 진언에 따라, 한산주에 둘레 4,360보 되는 주장성(晝長城)을 쌓는 등 방어진지를 구축했다. 9월에는 앞서 신라 땅에 억류하고 있던 웅진도독부 소속의 백제인 관원들과 앞서의 전투에서 사로잡은 포로들을 당으로 돌려보내면서 왕이 직접 표문과 많은 물품을 바치는 등 당에 대해 유화책을 폈다.
13년(673년) 2월부터 9월까지, 문무왕은 당의 침략에 대한 대응으로 서형산성(西兄山城)과 사열산성(沙熱山城)을 비롯해, 국원성(國原城), 북형산성(北兄山城), 소문성(召文城), 이산성(耳山城), 수약주(首若州)의 주양성(走壤城), 달함군의 주잠성(主岑城), 거열주(居烈州)의 만흥사산성(萬興寺山城), 삽량주(歃良州)의 골쟁현성(骨爭峴城) 등 여러 성을 쌓게 하고, 대아찬(大阿飡) 철천(徹川) 등을 보내 병선 100척을 거느리고 서해를 지키게 하였다. 한편 이 사이에 국가의 원로이자 재상이었던 태대각간 김유신이 죽고, 아찬 대토(大吐)가 모반하여 당에 붙으려다 발각되어 처형당하는 등의 사건도 일어났다. 거듭되는 전쟁에서 신라는 말갈·거란의 병사까지 끌어들인 당군과 맞서 아홉 번의 전투를 통해 2천 명을 죽이고, 호로하(瓠瀘河)와 왕봉하(王逢河)에서도 당군을 상대로 큰 전과를 올렸다. 겨울에 당병은 고구려의 우잠성(牛岑城)을 쳐서 함락시키고, 거란·말갈의 병사들은 대양성(大楊城)과 동자성(童子城)을 쳐서 멸했다. 한편 신라는 주(州)와 군(郡)에 처음으로 외사정(外司正)을 두고, 백제 멸망 뒤 무열왕에 의해 폐지되었던 수병제(戍兵制)를 부활시키는 등 지방에 대한 통제를 강화해나갔다.
14년(674년) 1월 당에서 숙위하다 귀국한 대나마 덕복(德福)이 가져온 신력(新曆)을 반포했다. 같은 달 문무왕이 고구려 유민을 받아들이고 백제령을 지배하에 두는 것을 보고 화가 난 고종은 조서(詔書)로 문무왕의 관작을 깎아 없애려 하였다. 왕의 동생으로 당에 머무르고 있던 우효위원외장군(右驍衛員外大將軍) 임해군공(臨海郡公) 김인문을 신라왕에 봉하면서, 그를 귀국시키는 편에 많은 군사를 딸려보내 대규모로 신라를 치려 했다. 문무왕은 8월에 서형산(西兄山) 아래에서 대규모 사열식을 벌이고, 9월에는 영묘사(靈廟寺) 앞길에서 다시 대규모 사열식과 함께 아찬 설수진(薛秀眞)의 육진병법(六陣兵法)을 관람하는 등의 군사훈련을 실시한다. 그리고 이 달에 고구려왕 안승을 다시 보덕왕으로 봉했다.
15년(675년) 봄 정월에 구리로 각 관청 및 주·군의 인장(印章)을 만들어 지급했다. 2월에 당의 장수 유인궤가 칠중성(七重城)에서 우리 군사를 깨뜨린 뒤 돌아가고, 이근행이 안동진무대사(安東鎭撫大使)로 임명되었다. 문무왕은 다시 당에 사신을 보내 조공하며 유감을 표명했고, 당은 이에 대한 화답으로 앞서 깎아 없앴던 문무왕의 관작을 회복시켰다. 이때에는 대부분의 백제령이 신라의 지배하에 들어가게 되고, 고구려 남쪽 경계에 이르기까지 신라의 주와 군이 설치되어 있었다. 이에 문무왕은 당이 쳐들어올 것에 대비해 아홉 부대의 병사를 내보내 막게 하였다. 과연 가을 9월, 당은 설인귀를 대장으로 하는 군사를 신라에 보내 천성(泉城)을 치게 했는데, 이때 당에 숙위하고 있던 풍훈(風訓)이 향도(鄕導)로서 당을 도왔다. 그러나 신라의 장군 문훈(文訓) 등의 선전으로 당병 1,400명을 죽이고 그 병선 40척을 빼앗았으며, 설인귀가 포위를 풀고 도망치면서 내버리고 간 전마 1천 필까지 신라의 손에 들어왔다. 9월 29일에는 이근행이 20만 군사를 이끌고 매초성(買肖城)에 진을 쳤다. 신라군이 이를 공격하자 당군은 말 30,380필과 무수한 병기를 남겨 놓고 도망갔다. 나아가 안북하(安北河)를 따라 관(關)과 성을 설치하고 또 철관성(鐵關城)을 쌓았다. 《삼국사기》에 따르면 이 해에 신라와 당이 벌인 크고 작은 싸움이 18번인데, 모두 신라가 이겨서 당병 6,047명을 죽이고 말 200필을 얻었다고 한다.
16년(676년) 7월 당군이 도림성(道臨城)을 공격해 현령(縣令) 거시지(居尸知)를 죽였다. 11월에 사찬 시득(施得)이 수군을 거느리고 설인귀와 소부리주 기벌포(伎伐浦)에서 싸웠다. 이 싸움에서 신라는 패했지만, 다시 나아가 22회에 걸친 크고 작은 싸움에서 모두 승리하여 당군 4천여 명을 목베었다. 이후 당은 백제령 안에 있던 웅진도독부를 요동의 건안성(建安城)으로 옮기고, 평양에 두었던 안동도호부도 요동성(遼東城)을 거쳐 신성(新城)으로 옮기는 등 한반도에서 자국의 병사들을 철수시켰다.

통치 제도 정비
18년(678년) 1월 북원소경(北原小京)을 설치하고 대아찬(大阿湌) 오기(吳起)에게 지키게 하였다.
20년(680년) 5월 가야군(加耶郡)에 금관소경(金官小京)을 설치하였다.

붕어 (문무대왕릉)
681년 7월 1일에 56세로 붕어하였다. 유조(遺詔)에 따라 시신은 화장하였고, 경주 감은사(感恩寺) 동쪽 바다 대왕암(大王岩) 위에 장사하였으며 이것이 오늘날 경주시의 관광지이자 경북동해안 국가지질공원의 지질유산인 경주 문무대왕릉으로 남아 있다. 문무왕의 유조는 다음과 같다.

사후 세속에서는 왕이 용이 되어 나라를 지킨다는 전설이 널리 퍼져 신의 대상으로 한반도에서 오랫동안 숭배되었다.

기타
고려 시대에는 문무왕을 문호왕(文虎王)이라고 불렀다. 이유는 고려 혜종의 휘가 왕무(王武)였기 때문에 피휘를 하기 위해 무(武)를 뜻이 같은 호(虎)로 바꿨기 때문이었다.
대한민국 해군의 DDH-976 문무대왕함은 충무공이순신급 구축함의 제2번 함이다.

1727년에는 정미환국으로 소론이 기용되자 사서에 등용되어 영남안집어사로 나가 부정한 관리들을 적발했고, 1728년 이인좌의 난이 일어나자 사로 도순문사 오명항(吳命恒)의 종사관으로 출전하여 전공을 세워 경상도 관찰사에 발탁되고, 분무공신(奮武功臣) 2등으로 영성군(靈成君)에 봉해졌다. 1730년 참찬관에 이어 호서 어사로 나가 굶주린 백성의 구제에 힘썼으며, 1734년에 진주사 부사(副使)로 청나라에 다녀와 앞서 안동서원을 철폐 시킨 일로 탄핵을 받아 풍덕(豊德) 부사로 좌천 되었다.
1741년(영조 17년) 어영대장을 거쳐 함경도 진휼사로 나가 경상도의 곡식 1만 섬을 실어 와서 기민(飢民)을 구제하여 송덕비가 세워졌다. 1742년 병조 판서, 1743년 경기도 관찰사가 되었으나 부임하지 않아 1744년 황해도 수군절도사로 좌천 되었다. 1749년 호조판서가 되어 양역의 폐해를 논하다 충주 목사로 다시 좌천 되었다. 그 후 영남 균세사(均稅使)를 거쳐 판의금부사·세손사부를 지내고 1752년 왕세손인 의소세손이 죽자 약방제조로 책임을 추궁 받아 제주도에 안치되었다.
1753년 풀려 나와 우참찬에 올랐다. 1756년 5월 22일(음력 4월 24일) 자택에서 사망했다.

졸기영성군(靈城君) 박문수(朴文秀)가 졸(卒)하였다. 박문수는 춘방(春坊)에 있을 때부터 이미 임금이 알아줌을 받았으며, 무신년(1728년) 역변(逆變) 때에 조현명(趙顯命)과 더불어 함께 원수(元帥)의 막부(幕府)를 도와 개가를 아뢰고 돌아오니 임금의 권우(眷遇)가 날로 융숭하여 벼슬이 숭품(崇品)에까지 이르렀다. 나랏일에 대해서는 마음을 다하여 해이하지 아니하여 병조·호조 양부(兩府)에서 이정(釐正)하고 개혁한 것이 많았으며, 누차 병권(兵權)을 장악하여 사졸의 환심을 얻었다. 그러나 연석(筵席)에서 때때로 간혹 골계(滑稽)를 하여 거칠고 조잡(粗雜)한 병통(결점)이 있었다. 또 이광좌(李光佐)를 사표(師表)로 삼아 지론(持論)이 시종 일관 변하지 아니하였으니, 그 때문에 끝내 정승에 제배되지 못하였다. 그가 졸함에 미쳐 임금이 슬퍼하여 마지 않았다.영조실록 87권, 영조 32년 4월 24일 신유 1번째기사 1756년 청 건륭(乾隆) 21년

시신은 충청도 목천현(후일의 충청남도 천안시 동남구 북면 은지리) 학성산(鵲城山) 해좌(亥坐) 언덕에 매장되었다. 묘표는 이종성(李宗城)이 썼다.

평가
관찰사 등 지방관으로서 군정과 세정에 밝았던 것으로 전해진다.
그러나 고집이 센 성격으로 끝내 영의정에 오르지 못했다.
그는 소론이면서도 당론의 폐해를 비판하고 당색에 상관없이 인재를 등용할 것을 주장하였다고 한다.

암행어사로서의 활동 여부
암행어사의 전형으로 잘 알려져 있으나, 그와는 달리 실제로 임금으로부터 암행어사로 임명된 적은 없으며, 별견어사로만 4번 파견되었다. 보통 당하관이 암행어사에 임명되는데 박문수는 별견어사로 임명되었을 때 모두 당상관이었다.

저서

개요
휘는 유(瑈), 본관은 전주, 자는 수지(粹之)이다.
세종과 소헌왕후의 둘째 아들이다. 문종의 친남동생이자 안평대군, 금성대군 등의 친형이며 단종의 숙부이다. 즉위 전 군호는 수양대군(首陽大君)이다.
왕자 시절 《월인석보》와 《역대병요》 등의 편찬에 참여했다. 말타기와 활쏘기, 사냥을 즐겨 했고, 권람과 한명회를 필두로 신숙주, 정창손, 정인지, 김질 등의 집현전 학사들을 포섭하여 세력을 확대하였다.
1453년(단종 1년) 계유정난을 일으켜 안평대군, 김종서, 황보인 등을 제거하고 영의정부사에 올라 전권을 얻은 뒤 일등정난공신에 녹훈되었다. 단종 대신 섭정하며 조정을 장악하였다.
1455년(단종 3년) 단종으로부터 명목상 선위의 형식을 빌어 즉위하였다. 이는 생육신과 사육신 등의 반발과 사림 세력의 비판을 초래하였다. 단종 복위운동을 저지하고 사육신과 그 일족을 대량 숙청하였다.
즉위 후 태종이 실시하였던 6조 직계제를 부활시켰으며 과전법을 수정하여 현직 관리에게만 토지를 지급하는 직전법을 시행하였다. 세종 때 설치한 4군과 6진의 출몰하는 여진족을 몰아내고 토관제도를 실시하여 두만강 유역의 영유를 확고히 하였다.
불교에 귀의하여 왕실 사찰과 탑을 중수하고 법당을 찾아 승려들을 모아 불사를 자주 행하였으며 불교 서적을 간행하였다.
재위 후반에는 반정을 통해 정계에 진출한 훈구 공신들의 세력이 강성해지는 것을 염려하여 사림파와 귀성군과 남이 등 신진 세력을 등용하여 균형을 유지하려 했다.
1468년(세조 14년) 9월 7일, 예종에게 전위하고 태상왕이 되었다. 전위 다음날인 9월 8일, 수강궁 정전에서 승하하였다.

생애
탄생과 성장
1417년(태종 17년) 11월 7일, 태종의 셋째 왕자인 아버지 충녕대군(세종)과 경숙옹주 심씨(소헌왕후)의 차남이자 네 번째 자녀로 태어났다.
태어나고 궁궐 밖에서 양육되었으며 세종이 즉위한 뒤에도 세조는 한동안 궁밖 민가에서 자랐다. 그것은 당시 유아 사망의 정도와 궁실의 분위기가 그에게 맞지 않았기 때문으로 보이며 이와 더불어 큰할아버지인 정종과 할아버지인 태종의 승하가 잇따랐기 때문에 아이가 자라기에는 아직 환경이 좋지 않은 탓도 있는 듯하다.
세조실록은 그에 대해 '어릴 때 민간에서 자랐으므로 모든 어려움과 사실과 거짓을 자세히 일찍부터 겪어 알고 있었다.'고 하였다. 세조는 또한 이미 다섯 살의 나이에 《효경(孝經)》을 외워 주위의 사람들을 놀라게 하였는데 그의 이러한 영특함은 자라면서 형제들 중 단연 뛰어나 아버지 세종과 형인 문종에게 인정을 받았다.

대군 시절
입궐과 대군 봉작
1428년(세종 10년) 6월 16일, 진평대군(晉平大君)에 봉작되었다. 그해 10월 13일 당시 군기감 부정(軍器監副正)으로 재직중이던 윤번(尹璠)의 딸 낙랑부대부인 윤씨(정희왕후)와 결혼식을 올렸다.
1429년(세종 11년) 2월 세종이 평강(平康)에 친히 나가 무예를 강무(講武)할 때, 그는 그간 익혔던 궁술을 발휘한 적이 있었다. 이 때가 그의 나이 불과 열 셋이었다. 몰이꾼들이 몰아오는 사슴을 향해 화살 7발을 쏘았는데 이것이 모두 사슴 목을 관통하였으니 보는 이들이 모두 감탄하였다. 1431년 여름 피부병인 창진에 걸렸으나, 그해 9월 23일 의원 양홍달(楊弘達), 조청(曹聽), 노중례(盧重禮) 등의 진료로 병이 나았다. 세종대왕은 이들 의원에게 옷을 선물로 하사했다.
처음에는 진평대군이었으나 후에 봉작이 바뀌어 1433년(세종 15년) 6월 27일 함평대군(咸平大君)이 되었는데, 함평(咸平)은 함흥(咸興)의 별칭이었다. 그런데 그의 작호를 전라도 함평현(咸平縣)과 혼동될까 우려된다는 이유로, 그해 7월 1일 진양대군(晉陽大君)으로 개봉되었다.
1445년(세종 27년) 다시 수양대군(首陽大君)으로 개봉되었다.

교육과 소년기
포은 정몽주의 제자 권우의 문하에서 수학한 세종은 왕위에 오르자마자 유교 정치의 이상을 실현하기 위해 자신의 세자(뒤의 문종)를 성균관에 입학시키고, 이어 다른 대군들도 성균관에 입학시켜 성리학을 배우게 한다. 세종은 왕업을 튼튼하게 하기 위해 왕자들의 교육에도 상당히 관심을 갖고 신경을 썼다. 이러한 세종의 특별 배려 속에 왕자들과 함께 수학하였으나 그 가운데에서도 다재다능하여 일찍 배운 것을 습득하고 응용하였다.
1433년 12월 12일 조선을 방문했다가 명나라로 돌아가는 사신 맹날가래(孟捏加來)·최진(崔眞) 등을 세종대왕을 대신하여 전송하였다. 1434년 18세 때 그는 세종을 따라 왕방산(王方山)에서 강무하게 되었는데 그는 하루아침에 사슴과 노루 수 십 마리를 쏘아서 털에 묻은 피가 바람에 날려 겉옷이 다 붉게 물들었다. 늙은 무사 이영기(李英奇) 등이 보고 감격하여 “오늘 뜻밖에 다시 태조의 신무(神武)를 뵙는 듯합니다.” 하였다. 박시백 화백의 《조선왕조실록》(휴머니스트)에 의하면, 수양대군은 박식하지만 병약했던 형 문종과는 달리 무예 실력도 출중했다. 승마와 격구, 활쏘기 재주가 뛰어났고, 사냥을 즐겼다.
그는 일찍부터 무인의 기질이 뛰어났다. 사람들이 궁마(弓馬)에 대한 일을 이야기하려 하면 그는 마음속으로 이를 좋아하였고 자신도 그렇게 하려고 마음먹기도 하여 항상 활과 화살을 가지고 다녔다. 또 당시 수렵 중 가장 재미있고 호쾌한 것으로 꼽히던 매사냥을 좋아하여 자신이 직접 매를 사육시켜 사냥을 다니곤 하였다. 자칫 궁중 생활로 약해질지도 모르는 체력을 승마를 통하여 다져나갔다. 세조는 사냥과 궁술, 마술 등을 익혀 상당한 정도의 경지에 이르렀고, 이는 훗날 무인 선발과 그가 중심이 되어 편찬하는 <역대병요(歷代兵要)> 찬집에 도움이 되기도 한다.
1435년(세종 17) 4월 1일 명나라 사신이 한성에 왔으나, 병으로 접견이 어려운 세종대왕 대신, 4월 27일까지 그가 명나라 사신단을 접대했다. 1436년(세종 18) 2월 세종이 세조가 문학을 좋아한다고 하여 친히 <자치통감(資治通鑑)>을 내려 주었다. 이 때 세조가 고금의 서사(書史)를 다 보았고, 더욱 성리학에 정통하였는데 매양 말하기를, '천하의 서적을 다 읽지 않고서는 나는 다시 활을 잡지 않겠다.'라고 하였다. 그의 형인 세자는 일찍이 수양의 활에다 쓰기를, '철석 같은 그 활이여, 벼락인양 그 살이로다. 버티임은 보겠으나 풀어짐을 못 보겠네.'라는 시를 친히 적어주기도 하였다.

정치 활동
정치활동 초기와 전제 개혁
부왕 세종의 병환과 그의 재능을 알아본 세종의 특별 지시로 그는 정사에 참여할 수 있었다. 1439년(세종 21년) 7월 종친(宗親)들을 관리하는 종부시 제조(宗簿寺提調)가 되었다. 이후 전제상정소(田制詳定所)를 설치하면서 전제상정소 도제조(田制詳定所都提調)가 되어 농지를 실제 농민에게 부여하는 토지제도의 분배 재개혁을 주관하였으며, 세종 재위기간 중 치평요람(治平要覽)· 역대병요(歷代兵要)·의주상정(儀註詳定) 등의 서적의 편찬과 찬술을 감독하였으며 중국의 운회(韻會)를 훈민정음(한글)로 번역하였다. 또한 명나라와 천축국에서 불서들을 구하여 불서들을 훈민정음으로 번역, 보급하기도 했다.
1440년(세종 22년)에 세종이 규표(圭表 : 천문관측기계의 하나)를 바로 잡을 때의 세조와 안평대군 및 다른 유신들에게 명하여 삼각산 보현봉(普賢峯)에 올라 해지는 곳을 관측하게 하였다. 돌길이 위험하고 또 불측한 벼랑이 내려다 보였으므로 안평대군 이하의 모든 사람들이 모두 눈이 어지럽고 다리가 떨려서 전진하지 못하였으나 세조만은 유난히 걸음이 나는 듯하여 순식간에 올라갔다 내려갔다 하니 보는 이가 모두 탄복하여 `따를 수 없다' 하였다. 늘 소매 넓은 옷을 입었으므로 궁중 사람들이 모두 웃으니 세종이 이르기를, ""너와 같은 용력있는 사람은 의복이 이만큼이나 넓고 커야만 될 것이다.""라고고 하였다.
1441년 6월 세종의 명으로 《치평요람(治平要覽)》의 간행, 인쇄를 감독하였다. 1443년 10월 말에는 토지의 측정에 참여하였다. 1443년(세종 25년) 11월 전제 상정소(田制詳定所)가 설치되자 도제조(都提調)가 되었다가 1444년 전제소 제조(田制所提調)에 임명되었고, 1445년(세종 27년) 진양대군에서 고쳐져서 수양대군(首陽大君)으로 개봉되었다.

문종의 대리청정
세종이 병들고 세자였던 문종이 대리청정을 하자, 그는 동생인 안평대군과 함께 신하들에게 세종과 문종의 교지를 전하기도 하였다. 수양대군과 안평대군 형제는 당시 조정 중신들이 왕권에 공공연히 도전하는 것을 보고 탐탁치 않게 여기며 후일을 기약했다고 한다. 그러나 둘째 아들 수양과 셋째 아들 안평에게 야심이 있다는 것을 간파한 부왕 세종대왕은 수양과 안평을 궐 근처에서 떨어져 있게 했다.
세종 자신의 생각도 통념적인 종법대로 적자로서 왕위를 계승시켜 왕위 계승의 올바른 길을 마련해야 한다는 의지를 갖고 있었다. 그러나 수양의 야심을 경계하면서도 수양이 왕위에 오르리라는 생각은 불가능하리라 확신했고, 세조의 형인 문종도 모든 면에 있어 군주로서의 능력을 십분 가지고 있었다. 수양의 역할이란 그저 왕실을 보위하는데 기여하는 것으로 끝날 수 밖에 없었을 것이다. 그러나 문종은 체력, 건강이 좋지 않았다. 세종 자신도 소갈증과 눈병, 고혈압을 비롯한 질환에 시달려 건강이 좋지 않고, 좀 이른 시기이기는 하지만 문종에게 섭정을 하게 하여 왕위계승을 둘러싼 혼란을 미연에 방지하고자 하였다. 이에 부왕 세종은 성삼문, 박팽년, 신숙주, 신주원, 이개 등 집현전 학사들에게 어린 원손을 보필하라는 당부를 여러번 거듭하였다.

저작 활동
수양대군이 야심이 있다는 소문이 문종 즉위 초부터 확산됨에 따라 그는 철저하게 자신은 왕위에 뜻이 없는 것처럼 행동하였다. 계속 명나라와 인도에서 불서들을 수입하여 탐독하였고, 매사냥과 활쏘기를 즐겨하였다.
수양대군은 세종의 병약함을 기회로 일부 국정전반에 참여할 수 있었다. 그러나 그는 왕이 되고자 하는 야심을 철저히 숨겼고, 정치보다는 학문과 서적 간행에 힘쓰면서 인맥을 형성하고 정치를 하려는 기회를 노렸다. 이때에 그는 한명회, 권람을 알게 되고 그들로부터 뒤에 신숙주, 정인지 등의 인재들을 포섭하게 된다. 대군으로 있으면서 그는 전제상정소(田制詳定所)를 설치하여 도제조(都提調)가 되어 토지제도의 재개혁을 맡았으며, 〈치평요람 治平要覽〉·〈역대병요 歷代兵要〉·〈의주상정 儀註詳定〉 등의 책을 찬술했고 중국의 〈운회 韻會〉를 한글로 번역했다.
그는 집현전의 학사들의 마음을 얻으려고 하였으나 실패하였다. 집현전 학사들 중 일부는 안평대군에게 마음을 두고 있었다. 그러나 그는 신숙주와 정인지 등을 자신의 편으로 포섭하는데 성공한다.

집권 과정
왕족, 훈신들의 위기 의식
그는 보통의 왕자로 남을 수도 있었다. 그러나 문종이 병약했고, 후사(단종)도 나이가 어렸다. 세종 자신도 병중인데다가, 문종은 부왕보다도 더 병약하여 요절할 우려도 있었다. 세종은 일찍 문종에게 대리청정을 하게 하여 왕위계승을 둘러싼 혼란을 미연에 방지하고자 하였다. 세종은 또, 자신이 죽고 세자 역시 오래 못갈 것을 예상하고 집현전의 학사들에게 어린 세손의 보필을 부탁하였다. 그는 이를 기회로 여기게 되었다.
1450년 세종이 승하하고 문종이 그 뒤를 이었다. 1452년(문종 2년) 4월 관습 도감 도제조(慣習都監都提調)에 임명되었다. 이때 그는 야심을 철저히 숨기고 불사 중창과 법회에 참석하는 등 자신의 뜻을 철저히 감추었다. 그가 관습도감 도제조가 되자 사간원에서 종친에게 실직을 주는 것이 옳지 않다고 탄핵했으나 문종이 듣지 않았다.
1452년 문종은 병약하여 즉위한 지 2년여 만에 승하하고 12살의 어린 조카 단종이 즉위하였다.그런데 어린 단종이 즉위하고 김종서나 황보인 등이 황표정사를 시행하자 불만이 강하게 나오고 있었고 종친들은 저마다 영향력을 강화하려 하였다. 분경(청탁 등의 목적으로 종친을 방문하는 일)을 금지하려 하자 수양대군 등이 강력항의 하여 김종서 등 신하들은 시행하지 못했다.

정변 기도와 권력 장악
단종이 즉위하자 왕족의 대표로서 자신을 단종을 최측근에서 모실 수 있는 보호자라고 말하였고, 무신 세력을 양성하여 왕위를 찬탈할 기회를 호시탐탐 엿보고 있었다. 그러던 중, 안평대군 계열이 먼저 손을 쓰려는 움직임이 감지되자 1453년에 계유정난을 일으켰는데, 이때 그는 지나치게 비대해진 신권을 억압한다는 명분으로 종친과 사대부가 모두 지지한 것은 아니다. 이후 장악원 제조(掌樂院提調) 등을 역임하며 권력 기반을 다지게 된다.
이어 1453년 10월 수양대군은 한명회·권람 등과 공모하여 홍윤성·홍달손 등의 병력을 동원함으로 문종의 고명(誥命)을 받아 단종을 보필하던 황보인·절재 김종서(섭정)·정분 등을 죽이고 10월 10일 아우 안평대군을 강화도에 유배시켜, 병조판서, 이조판서 등을 겸한 뒤 스스로 영의정부사 겸 섭정이 되어 정권을 완전히 장악하였다. 이어 1454년(단종 3년) 3월 논공행상을 정하여 정난공신을 책정하고 자신은 분충장의광국보조정책정난공신(奮忠杖義匡國輔祚定策靖難功臣) 1등관에 서훈하였다.
그 뒤 안평대군의 양가의 재산을 적몰하고, 성녕대군 부인 성씨 등을 폐출시킨 뒤 안평대군의 가족, 측근들을 노비로 삼았다. 이후 안평대군의 처형을 유도하여 탄핵, 그해 10월 19일 강화도 배소에서 사사한 뒤, 실권을 장악했다. 3월말에는 스스로 중외 병마 도통사가 되어 병권을 장악하였고, 이어 동생 금성대군과, 단종의 보호자로 세종의 후궁이며 단종을 양육했던 혜빈 양씨 등이 그의 집권에 반발하였으나, 훈신들의 추대로 1455년 음력 6월에는 결국 단종을 강제적으로 왕위에서 밀어냄으로써 조선의 새 왕으로 등극하였다.
바로 혜빈 양씨와 금성대군이 서로 결탁하여 전횡을 휘둘렀다는 이유로 탄핵한 뒤 가산을 몰수시키고 혜빈 양씨는 충청도 청풍으로, 금성대군은 경상도 순흥으로 유배보냈다. 또한 영풍군은 예안(禮安)으로 유배 된 후 6월 27일에는 임실(任實)로 이배 되었다가 청풍으로 위리안치(圍籬安置)시킨다. 한남군은 윤6월 11일에 금산(錦山)에 유배보냈다가 아산(牙山)에 이배되었으며 세조 2년인 1456년 음력 6월 27일에는 함양(咸陽)으로 옮겨졌다. 그리고 같은 해 1455년 12월 17일(음력 11월 9일) 혜빈 양씨를 교수형에 처한다.

즉위 이후
즉위 초반
즉위 초 그는 왕권 강화를 목표로 중앙집권을 추진한다. 세조는 육조직계제를 실시하고 세종대의 의정부서사제를 폐지했다. 세조는 관제 개편과 신하들의 기강 확립을 통해 중앙 집권제를 확립했으며, 또한 호패법을 다시 복원하였다. 국방력 신장에도 힘써서, 각 읍의 군사를 5위에 분속토록 하여 군제(軍制)를 확정, 각 역로를 개정하여 찰방(察訪)을 신설, 예문관의 장서를 간행했고, 각 도의 거진(巨鎭 : 중간 규모의 군진)을 설치했다.
각지의 수령을 국왕이 직접 임명하되, 백성들에게 수령을 탄핵할 수 있는 권한을 부여하였다. 8도의 관찰사가 일부 작은 현의 현감, 현령을 임명할 수 있었으나 현령과 현감은 왕이 직접 임명하는 것으로 바꾼다. 또한 영의정, 좌의정, 우의정 등의 삼정승과 좌찬성, 우찬성이 육조판서들의 정무를 결재하는 의정부서사제에서 왕이 직접 육조판서들의 서류를 결재하고 정무를 주관하는 6조 직계제로의 개정을 추진하였다. 그러나 예조참판인 하위지가 이를 정면으로 반대하였다.
이때 세조는 내가 나이가 어려 국정을 처리 못하겠는가 하며 하위지를 참형에 처하라는 지시를 했다. 사관은 이 사건을 두고 정변후임을 알지 못하고 하위지가 어리석은 의견을 개진했다고 평했다(당일 조선왕조실록 참고)
세조는 하위지의 재주와 신념을 아껴 그에게 여러번 교서를 내려 부름을 받아 예조 참판에 임명하였다. 그러나 그의 본 뜻은 진실로 단종을 위하는 일에 있었기 때문에 세조의 녹(祿)을 먹는 것을 부끄럽게 여겨 세조가 즉위한 해부터의 봉록은 따로 한 방에 쌓아 두고 먹지를 않았다 한다. 그러나 하위지는 세조의 강권정치에 맞서다가 왕의 노여움을 사서 추국의 명을 받기도 하였다.
즉, 세조가 즉위하자 왕권 강화책으로 종전부터 시행하던 의정부 서사제(署事制)를 대신하여 육조가 관장사무를 의정부를 거치지 않고 직접 왕에게 상계하는 육조 직계제(六曹直啓制)를 다시금 시행하여 의정부의 권한을 축소시켰다.
이러한 세조의 조처에 반대하고 고대 주나라 제도를 들어 의정부 서사제의 유지를 강력히 주장하였던 것이다.
하위지는 즉위 초 세조가 역대병요와 병서 편찬을 도운 사람들을 승진시키려 한 것을 반대하였다. 단종 즉위 초, 수양대군이 앞장서서 《역대병요》 병서(兵書)의 편찬에 참여했던 집현전 학사의 품계를 승진시키려 하였다. 역대병요와 병서의 책임자가 수양대군이었기 때문이다. 그러나 그는 서적의 편찬 사업은 집현전 본래의 업무이므로 품계를 올려야 할 하등의 이유가 없음을 들어 단종에게 상소를 올려 자신의 품계를 올리는 것에 반대하였다. 또한, 이 일을 수양대군이 나서서 처리하는 데 대해서도 반대하였다. 즉, 관직을 내리고 상을 주는 것은 국가의 공기(公器)이므로 경솔히 시행할 수가 없고, 그리고 종신(宗臣)의 신분으로 사은(私恩)을 베풀려는 수양대군의 처사는 매우 부당하다는 것이다. 그는 자신의 직책이 의리상 불가하다고 청해 집현전 직제학에 전보되었다.
한명회를 시켜서 행정기관의 개편을 추진하고 향소부곡 제도를 폐지한다. 한명회는 5가구를 1개의 통으로 묵는 오가작통법과 다시 5개의 통을 1개 리로 하고, 몇개의 리를 면(面)으로 하는 면리제를 창안하여 세조에게 건의한다. 오가작통법으로 세금의 납부가 수월해졌고 세금납부를 피하여 달아난 자들에게는 같은 통과 리에 사는 주민들에게 세금을 거두게 된다. 오가작통법은 조선 말기까지 유지되었으나 면리제는 대한제국이 멸망한 후에도 계속 유지된다.

두 번의 단종 복위 사건과 대숙청
1455년 7월 25일(윤 6월 11일)에 승천체도열문영무(承天體道烈文英武)의 존호를 받았다.
1453년 10월 25일 함길도 종성에서 일어난 이징옥의 난이 발생했으나 부하들이 이징옥을 배신하는 내분으로 쉽게 토벌했다.
1456년 2월 단종을 복위시킬 목적으로 성삼문 등이 거사를 도모하다가 세조의 측근인 정창손의 사위 김질의 밀고로 일망타진되었다.
세조가 즉위한 이듬해 (1456년) 에 성삼문·박팽년·유성원·하위지·이개·김문기 등을 비롯한 집현전 학사 출신 관료들과 유응부, 성승 무인들은 연회때 별운검을 설치한 뒤 세조 3부자를 제거하고 단종의 복위를 꾀하려 계획을 수립하였다. 그러나 가담자의 한명인 김질이 자신의 장인 정창손에게 이를 말하고, 정창손의 설득에 의해 사육신의 정변 기도를 폭로한다. 1456년 6월 성삼문 등이 단종의 복위를 꾀했다는 사실을 알게 된 세조는 단종을 노산군으로 강봉한 후 강원도 영월로 유배보내고, 집현전을 폐지하였다. 세조는 사육신을 직접 국문하였다. 하위지 등은 그의 편에 서면 용서해주겠다는 제의를 거절했고, 박팽년은 세조에게 신(臣)이라 말하기를 거부하고, 거(巨)자로 썼으며, 세조 즉위 이후에 받은 월급은 받지 않고, 한 창고에 쌓아두었다. 세조는 사육신과 관련자들을 비롯한 그 남성 일족 6백여 명을 처형하고, 유배보냈으며 사육신 가문의 여성들은 공신의 노비와 관비로 충군하였으며, 4촌 이상의 친척들은 노비로 삼거나 외지로 유배를 보내는 등의 대숙청을 감행한다.
그 후 1457년 9월에, 세종의 여섯째 아들이자 세조의 넷째 동생 금성대군이 다시 한번 단종 복위계획을 세운다. 이렇게 금성대군, 순흥부사 이보흠 등이 또다시 단종 복위 사건을 일으키자 금성대군과 관련자들을 모두 처형하였다. 또한 사육신과 관계된 여인과 재산을 공신의 노비로 분배하여 멸문시켰다. 이후 세조의 조정에 출사하지 않고 야인으로 일생을 보내는 이들도 있었다. 이를 단종복위사건으로 숙청된 사육신에 대비하여 생육신이라 한다. 결국 이러한 일련의 사건은 세조로 하여금 의심을 더욱 부추기는 원인이 됐고, 조카인 단종을 죽이게 하는 결정적인 계기로 작용하였다. 세조는 결국 신하들의 간언에 따라 단종에게 죽음을 내렸고, 단종은 17세의 나이로 사약을 받게 되었다.(정확하지 않다. 세조실록은 단종을 후히 장사지내주었다로 기술되어 있으나 시신을 수습
하지 않아 호장 엄흥도가 시신을 매장하고 달아난 것은 노산군에서 단종으로 복위때 실록에 기술되어 있는 사실이다).

사림파의 등용
한편 사육신과 관련자들, 집현전 학사들의 대대적 숙청과 함께 생육신 등의 문사들 조차 그에게 등을 돌리고 낙향, 시골과 야산에 은거한다. 사육신 등을 처형한 뒤 문사들을 억압, 탄압한다는 비판에 직면하자 그는 정몽주의 후손들과 문도들을 발굴해서 등용한다. 이때 김숙자와 김종직 역시 등용되는데, 이들의 정계 진출 이후 향촌에 은거하던 사림파가 중앙 정계에 진출하게 된다. 처음에 어떤 대신이 김종직(金宗直)을 천거하자 세조는 친히 만나보고는 면전에서 '완고하여 쓸모 없는 선비다. 등용할 것 없다.'고 하였다. 그러나 훈구파의 발호를 두려워한 그는 훈구파를 숙청하지 못하는 대신, 김종직을 청요직에 기용한다.
김종직은 세조에 의해 등용되었으면서도 후일 조의제문을 지어 세조의 반정을 조롱했고, 김종직의 제자들과 그의 학파는 세조의 반정을 찬탈로 규정하고 조롱하였으며, 이는 훗날 김일손이 무오사화 때 처형당한 원인이 되었다. 세조 즉위 중반에는 사림의 세력은 미약하였으나 손자인 성종대에 사림은 본격적으로 정계에 진출하여 하나의 정파세력을 형성하게 된다.

내정과 외치
세조는 먼저 신하들의 권력을 제한하고, 왕권을 강화하는 정책을 폈다. 세조는 관제 개편과 신하들의 기강 확립을 통해 중앙 집권제를 확립했으며, 또한 호패법을 다시 복원하였다. 국방력 신장에도 힘써서, 각 읍의 군사를 5위에 분속토록 하여 군제(軍制)를 확정, 각 역로를 개정하여 찰방(察訪)을 신설, 예문관의 장서를 간행했고, 각 도의 거진(巨鎭 : 중간 규모의 군진)을 설치했다.
1457년에는 《동국통감》, 《국조보감》 등의 편찬을 시작하는 등 법전 편찬과 서적 편찬 등의 사업을 벌였으며, 원구제(圜丘祭)를 실시하는 등의 문화 사업을 펼쳐 사회를 새롭게 바꾸어 나갔다.
1459년 신숙주(申淑舟)를 파견하여 여진족을 타이르게 했고, 경고를 듣지 않자 토포사를 보냈다. 또한, 이 해에 아버지 세종대왕과 장남 의경세자의 명복을 빌기 위해 《월인석보》를 간행하였다.

이듬해 《경국대전》의 편찬을 시작하였다. 1461년에는 간경도감(刊經都監)을 신설하여 불경을 간행했으며, 불교를 숭상하여 《원각경》(圓覺經)을 편찬하게 하고 원각사(圓覺寺)를 창건했다. 또한 과전(科田)을 폐지하고 직전제(職田制)를 실시토록 하였다. 규형(窺衡)·인지의(印地儀)를 친히 제작하여 토지 측량을 용이하게 하였다.
한편 그가 며느리인 귀인 권씨(貴人 權氏)와 소훈 윤씨(昭訓 尹氏)를 범하려 했다는 추문이 돌았다. 권귀인과 윤소훈은 세조의 장남 의경세자의 후궁들이었다. 김일손은 이 사실을 그대로 사초에 실었다가 사화의 원인이 되었고 김일손 자신도 희생되었다.김일손은 귀인권씨의 조카이자 양자 허반(許磐)에게서 들은 것을 사초에 기록하였는데 연산군은 사초 기사 중 권귀인은 바로 덕종의 후궁이온데 세조께서 일찍이 부르셨는데도 분부를 받들지 아니했다'는 구절과 '세조는 소훈 윤씨(昭訓 尹氏)에게 많은 전민과 가사를 내렸고 항상 어가가 따랐다'는 사초의 내용을 구실삼았다.

서적 간행 지원
세종 사후 세조 때 다시 활판 인쇄술이 활기를 띠고 서적의 보급이 재확산되는데, 활자를 주조, 보급하여 활판 인쇄와 서적 출간을 장려하기도 했다. 그런데 그의 출판 사업 중에는 <법화경> <금강경> 등 대장경을 인쇄하여 유포함으로써 불교발전에 이바지한 업적도 특기할 만하다.
또한 역사 관련 서적을 편찬, 재간행, 중수하고 이를 반포하여 사대부와 일반 백성들에게도 필독을 권고하여 국가의식, 민족의식을 고양시켰다. 〈국조보감 國朝寶鑑〉의 편수, 〈동국통감 東國通鑑〉의 편찬, 〈경제육전 經濟六典〉의 정비 등의 일련의 편수·편찬 작업이 이루어졌다. 이밖에도 〈오륜록 五倫錄〉·〈역학계몽도해 易學啓蒙圖解〉·〈주역구결 周易口訣〉·〈대명률강해 大明律講解〉·〈금강경언해 金剛經諺解〉·〈동국지도 東國地圖〉·〈해동성씨록 海東姓氏錄〉 등의 편찬사업을 적극 추진하였다.
1461년(세조 7년)에는 자신의 친필로 《대불정여래밀인수증요의제보살만행수능엄경》을 간행하였다. 주자소에서 세조의 친필과 강희안의 필적을 바탕으로 을해자(乙亥字)와 한글활자로 인출한 책으로, 한글 창제 무렵의 국어의 특징과 조선 초기 활자사 연구에 있어서 귀중한 판본이다. '대불정여래밀인수증요의제보살만행수능엄경'은 후일 보물 제1520호로 지정된다. 불교 경전과 불교 관련 서적들이 시중에 대량으로 유포, 확산되었으며, 훈민정음으로 된 책들 중에는 불경, 불서들이 대량으로 시중에 유통되었다.

말년
현덕왕후 저주 관련
1457년 음력 6월 갑자기 악몽을 꾸고 형수 현덕왕후의 묘를 파헤쳐 폐서인시켰다. 이를 두고 여러 가지 전설과 야사가 나왔고, 세조 사후 희극 작품의 소재의 하나가 되기도 했다. 야사는 1457년 아들 덕종(의경세자)이 일찍 죽자 세조가 아들 단종의 죽음에 한을 품은 문종비 현덕왕후의 혼령이 사주한 것이라 착각하여 현덕왕후의 무덤을 파헤치고 관을 꺼내는 엽기적인 행각을 저질렀다고 전한다. 그러나 음애 이자가 쓴 '음애일기(陰崖日記)'에 의하면 그냥 물가로 이장했다고만 전한다. 음애일기에 의하면 '1457년의 어느 날 세조가 궁궐에서 낮잠을 자다가 가위에 눌리자 소릉(현덕왕후릉)을 파헤치라고 명하였다. 사신이 석실(石室)을 부수고 관을 끌어내려 하였으나, 무거워 들어낼 도리가 없었다. 군민(軍民)이 놀라고 괴상하게 여겨 제사를 지내니 그제서야 관이 움직였다. 이를 평민의 예로 장사지내고 물가에 옮겨 묻었다.'는 것이다. 야사와 달리 의경세자가 사망한 것은 1457년 음력 9월 2일로, 오히려 단종(1457년 음력 10월 21일)보다 한 달 정도 먼저 사망했다. 그러나 시중에는 현덕왕후의 저주로 의경세자가 사망했다는 소문이 시중에 유포되었다.
또한 현덕왕후가 세조 시기인 1457년 음력 6월 26일에 서인(庶人)으로 격하되었지만, 그것 또한 현덕왕후의 어머니와 동생이 단종 복위 운동을 벌이다 발각되어 처형당해 현덕왕후(1457년 음력 6월 26일 폐서인)가 아버지 권전(1456년 음력 7월 7일 폐서인)과 함께 연좌된 것이었다. 폐서인된 왕후의 능은 평민의 격에 맞도록 작게 재조성되었고, 제사 또한 지내지 않게 된다.
이후 중종 때부터 현덕왕후의 연좌제 적용이 합당치 않다는 주장이 제기되었고, 그에 따라 1513년 음력 3월 12일에는 중종이 현덕왕후를, 1699년 음력 7월 15일에는 숙종이 현덕왕후의 아버지 권전을 명예 회복시키게 된다.

문둥병
세조는 피부에 고름이 생기다가 나병으로 이어졌다. 세조가 나병에 걸리게 된 원인은 조선왕조실록에는 기록이 나타나지 않는다. 전설에 의하면 단종의 어머니인 현덕왕후의 원혼이 세조의 꿈에 나타나 내 아들을 죽인 원수라며 침을 뱉은 이후로 병증이 심해졌다 한다.
어의들도 치료를 못하자 그는 그 치료를 위해 온천욕을 즐겨 다녔으며, 아산의 온양온천 등에 행궁하기도 했다. 한번은 강원도 평창군 오대산 상원사 문수보살상 앞에서 100일 기도를 했다. 기도를 마치고 몸이 가려워 혼자 목욕을 하는데, 지나가는 동자승이 있어서 등을 밀어달라고 했다. 그리고 ""네가 나가서 행여나 사람을 만나더라도 상감 옥체에 손을 대고 흉한 종기를 씻어드렸다는 얘기를 해서는 안 된다.""고 하였더니 동자승이 미소를 지으며 ""잘 알겠습니다. 상감께서도 후일에 누구를 보시던지 오대산에 가서 문수동자를 친견했다는 말씀을 하지 마시기를 부탁드립니다.""하는 말과 함께 홀연히 사라져 버렸다는 전설이 있다. 현재 오대산 상원사 문수전에는 세조가 보았다는 목조 문수동자상이 있다.
세조는 상원사에서 백일기도를 드린 뒤, 5만 명의 화공과 5만 명의 목수를 동원, 자신의 기억을 되살려 문수동자상을 조성해 상원사에 봉안했다. 문수동자상은 1466년(세조 12년) 나병이 일시적으로 낫자 이를 기념하여 제작, 봉안한 것이다. 문수동자상은 1984년 10월 15일 국보 221호로 지정된다.
세조의 딸 의숙공주는 세조의 나병이 낫기를 기원한 기도문을 지어 문수동자전에 바쳤다. 의숙공주의 기원문은 1984년 7월 21일 평창군 상원사의 승려들 사리들과 함께 발견되었다. 문수동자상 내에서 속적삼도 발견되었는데, 이 속적삼은 1991년 3월 학자들의 연구 결과 세조의 것으로 밝혀졌다.

불교에 귀의
말년의 세조는 심한 악몽에 시달렸고, 밤에 잠을 이루지 못했다. 악몽과 악몽으로 인한 불면증을 계기로, 세조는 불교에 귀의할 결심을 한다. 시중에는 그의 아들 의경세자가 낮잠을 자다가 가위눌림으로 죽은 것도, 현덕왕후의 원혼이 죽인 것이라는 낭설이 떠돌기도 했다. 세조는 오래 악몽에 시달렸고 병세가 악화되었다. 그의 불교 귀의는 유교 성리학을 국교로 하는 조선의 국가 이념, 개국 이념과 정면 배치되는 것이었다. 그의 불교 귀의에 항의하여 김종직을 비롯한 사림 학자들과, 훈구 유학자들은 연명 상소와 사퇴 등으로 항의의사를 표시하기도 했으나, 세조의 만류로 무마되었다. 그러나 조선건국 당시 금지한 불교 금지령을 완화시켜 양반 사대부들 중에도 불자가 나타나기도 했다.
세조는 훈신 중 김수온(金守溫)의 형인 승려 신미(信眉, 본명은 김수성(金守省))를 왕사(王師)로 받들어 궁궐로 초빙했다. 유학자들은 연명상소와 사퇴를 선언했지만, 세조는 이를 묵살했다. 신미는 세종대왕 당시 세종대왕의 명으로 궁궐 내에 내원당(內願堂)의 건축과 법요(法要)를 주관했으며, 세종대왕의 명으로 복천사(福泉寺)의 중수를 맡아보았다. 문종 즉위 후에 신미는 선종의 지도자인 선교도총섭(禪敎都摠攝)에 임명되기도 했다. 신미는 평창 오대산 상원사의 중건에도 관여하였다.
세조는 여러 불당의 중수와 창건을 지원하였다. 훈구파 공신들과 사림파 신진 관료들의 반대에도 불구하고 궁내에 불당을 지었고, 원각사와 신륵사 등을 지원하였다. 또한 수종사(水鍾寺) 등의 중건을 지원하기도 한다. 강원도의 월정사, 상원사 등에도 적극 시주, 후원하였고 파주 보광사, 남양주의 수종사와 양평 용문사, 합천의 해인사 등도 그가 후원하는 사찰들이었다.
그가 지원하던 사찰 중에는 경기도 양주 송촌리 용진의 운길산 수종사(水鍾寺)도 있었다. 그런데 수종사는 세조가 죽인 자신의 동생 금성대군 유가 시주해 세운 곳이기도 하다. 세조는 수종사를 다시 중건하고 대대적으로 지원하였다.
또한 세조는 유점사를 왕실의 복을 비는 원당으로 정하였으며, 조선의 왕 중에서는 유일하게 직접 금강산에 와서 장안사, 표훈사, 정양사 등을 들러보며 매년 쌀 100섬과 소금 50섬을 금강산의 사찰들에 (시주로) 지급하도록 지시한다. 이를 '세헌'이라고 하는데 뒤에는 200여섬으로까지 늘어나게 된다. 그런가 하면 반역죄로 처형당한 사람의 토지와 노비, 삼림 등을 금강산 사찰들에 나눠주기도 했다.
한편 그의 사후 금강산에 있는 표훈사에 그의 영정이 봉안되기도 했다. 합천 해인사에도 그의 영정이 봉안되었는데, 해인사의 영정은 1458년 7월 28일 윤사로, 조석문 등을 해인사 행향사(行香使)로 임명해 해인사에 파견할 때, 윤사로와 조석문의 건의로 해인사의 무명 승려에 의해 제작되었다. 이 해인사 영정은 2000년대까지도 전하고 있다.
왕자시절부터 불교에 심취했던 그는 불교는 왕실의 안녕과 미래를 보장하는 종교적인 신앙으로서 필요했다. 세조는 불교가 가지고 있는 호국성에 근거한 국가·민족 의식의 고양을 통해 국방력과 집권체제의 강화를 도모하고자 원각사(圓覺寺)를 세우고 〈월인석보 月印釋譜〉를 간행하였다. 1461년에는 간경도감(刊經都監)을 설치해 많은 불경을 국역하도록 명하기도 했다.

최후
나병을 앓던 그는 거듭된 악몽과 불면증에 시달렸고, 정신병적인 망상도 심해졌다. 1467년(세조 13) 5월에 함경도 회령에서 이시애가 반란을 일으켰다. 이시애는 유향소의 불만·불평, 백성의 지역감정 등에 편승하여 거병, 단종 폐위 등은 반역이라는 명분으로 거병했다. 그해 7월 조카 귀성군 준과 강순을 파견하여 평정케 하고, 8월 12일 진압한다. 이어 강순을 파견하여 함길도 너머 건주위(建州衛) 여진족을 토벌하였다. 그는 무장들을 신뢰하여 귀성군 준, 남이, 강순 등을 측근에 두었는데, 이들에 대한 세조의 총애에, 어떤 이유로 반감을 품은 왕세자는 즉위하자마자 이들을 모두 숙청했다.
한편 훈구 공신들의 발호를 우려하던 그는 만년에 길재, 김숙자 등 정몽주의 문하생들과 김종직 등을 중용하였다. 그러나 이들은 성종대에 가서 본격적으로 정치세력화된다.
말년에는 조카 단종을 내쫓다 못해 죽인 것에 대한 죄책감으로 인하여 불교에 귀의했다고도 한다. 왕위를 찬탈한 행위가 유교의 시각으로는 결코 용납되지 않는 만큼, 세조의 불교 융성 정책은 유교적 입지가 약했던 세조 나름의 성리학자 견제수단이었다는 견해도 있다. 그는 자신의 병을 일반적인 역창이나 종기 정도로 여겼지만 그의 병은 피부가 썩어들어가는 나병(癩病)이었다. 악몽과 불면증, 신경쇠약 등으로 병세는 차도를 보이지 않았다. 1468년 세조는 자신의 건강이 점점 악화되어 가고 있음을 깨닫고, 한명회 및 신숙주, 구치관 등을 불러 그들에게 왕세자를 잘 보필해줄 것을 부탁했다. 음력 9월 7일에 왕세자에게 왕위를 물려주고. 다음 날인 8일에 승하하였다. 바로 9월 10일 명나라에 고부사신 황중(黃中)·김계박(金繼朴) 등을 파견하여, 그해 12월 29일 혜장이라는 시호를 받아왔다. 당시 나이 향년 52세였다.

능묘
능은 경기도 양주(楊州)의 광릉(光陵)이다. 후에 정희왕후가 안장될 때 동원이강형의 봉분으로 조성되었다.

묘호 및 시호
묘호는 세조(世祖)이며 빈청에서 세조의 묘호로 신종(神宗), 예종(睿宗), 성종(聖宗)을 추천했으나, 예종이 '나라를 중흥한 공'을 들어 세조를 제안하였고 이대로 정해졌다. 이는 세종과 문종의 치세를 부정한 것으로 해석될 수 있다. 당시 예종은 승천체도라는 시호를 뺀 사실을 신하들에게 추궁했고 공신인 좌의정 박원형은 뜻이 헛된거 같다고 했지만 예종은 듣지 않았다.  존호는 승천체도열문영무(承天體道烈文英武)이고, 시호는 혜장승천체도열문영무지덕융공성신명예흠숙인효대왕(惠莊承天體道烈文英武至德隆功聖神明睿欽肅仁孝大王)이다.
사후 일부 무속인들에 의해 무속의 신으로 숭배되기도 하였다. 그 밖에 여러 사찰에도 봉안되었다. 그를 모신 대표적인 신당으로는 1970년대까지 서울시 마포구 신수동에 있던 복개당이 있다. 이 당제는 조선시대에는 제관이 열 명이 넘을 정도로 규모가 컸으나 일제 시대에 제관이 5~6명으로 줄었다. 1978년 노인정 공사로 철거되었다. 복개당에 보관되오던 영정은 국립중앙박물관에 보관중에 있다.

사상과 신념
육조직계제
그는 왕권이 신권보다 우위에 서야 된다고 확신하였다. 따라서 의정부 서사제나 6조의 판서와 한성부 판윤->의정부 좌,우찬성->삼정승을 거쳐서 왕에게 하달되던 것을 왕이 직접 6조 판서와 한성부 판윤에게 안건에 대한 결재를 받고 직접 인사권과 영향력을 행사하려 하였다.

공신 견제
사육신의 숙청과 생육신생육신: 김시습(金時習)·원호(元昊)·이맹전(李孟專)·조려(趙旅)·성담수(成聃壽)·남효온(南孝溫)·유응부(兪應孚) 을 말한다. 이들은 세조 즉위 후 관직을 그만두거나 아예 관직에 나아가지 않고 세조의 즉위를 부도덕한 찬탈행위로 규정하고 비난하며 지내다 죽었다. 중종반정 후 사림파가 등장, 사육신에 대한 새로운 평가가 나오게 되면서 이들의 절의 또한 새로운 평가를 받게 되었다.등의 축출로 공신들의 권력이 비대해지자 그는 재야에 있던 김종직 등의 사림파를 등용하여 공신들의 월권행위를 견제하려 했다. 그러나 한편으로는 한명회와 신숙주에게 무한한 신뢰를 보이는 것과 홍윤성 처벌에 소극적인 것 등 이중적인 태도를 취했다. 실제로 공신들의 전횡과 양민 수탈에 대해 처벌은 없었다. 자신의 지지기반이기 때문이다.

수종사 복설
세조가 만년에 병을 치료하려 오대산에 갔다 돌아올 때였다. 뱃길로 한강을 따라 환궁하는 도중 밤이 되어 양수리에서 야경을 즐기고 있었다. 이 때 옆에 있는 운길산에서 때 아닌 종소리가 들렸다. 신하를 보내 알아보게 하니 절터가 있고, 바위벽에 18나한상이 줄지어 앉아 있는데 그 바위틈에서 물방울이 떨어지면서 종소리를 내고 있었다.
이 사실을 접한 세조는 매우 감동했고, 마침내 발심하여 절터에 절을 복원케 하고 이름을 수종사라 하도록 했다고 전한다. 수종사는 1459년(세조 5) 왕명에 의해 중창되었다. 종각 밑에는 세조가 직접 심었다는 은행나무가 오랜 세월만큼이나 굵은 나이테를 간직하고 있다.

무속 신봉
유교사회에 속했으면서도 그는 무속과 불교를 신봉하였다. 왕위찬탈을 모의하고 있던 수양 대군이 하루는 시중의 민심의 동태를 살피고 있었다. 그런데 특이하게 글자판, 한자로 판을 놓고 글자로 점을 치는 점쟁이를 만났다. 수양대군은 아무 생각없이 밭전(田)자를 고르자 점장이가 '허허 사공이 많으면 배가 산으로 간다지만 왕이 많은 이 나라는 어디로 가는가?'라고 대답했다고 한다. 놀란 수양대군은 무슨 얘기인지를 물어본 즉, 밭전자는 임금 왕(王)자 두개를 수평과 수직으로 겹쳐놓은 글자라는 것이다. 얼마 후 수양 대군은 다시 점장이를 찾아 똑 같이 밭전자를 골랐다고 합니다. 그러자 점장이가 '첩첩산중'이라고 예언하였다. 다시 궁금증이 생긴 수양대군이 점장이에게 이유를 묻자 뫼산(山)를 사방으로 겹쳐놓은 것과 같은 글자이므로 산중의 산, 첩첩산중이라는 것이다. 점장이가 무엇인가를 알고 있다고 의심한 수양 대군은 바른 말을 하지 않으면 죽여버릴 요량으로 허리에 칼을 차고 다시 점장이를 찾아가 칼 끝으로 다시 밭전(田)자를 골랐다고 한다. 죽음을 느낀 점장이는 말없이 밭전자의 좌우를 치더랍니다. 밭 전(田)자에서 좌우를 없애면 임금 왕(王)자가 된다. 그리고 좌와 우를 치우라고 예언했는데 이에 크게 깨달은 수양대군은 좌와 우를 좌의정과 우의정으로 판단, 좌의정 김종서와 우의정 정분을 제거하고 왕위에 올랐다고 한다.(실록엔 없다, 그가 왕이 될 야심이 있었다고 후세에 생각했다는 방증이 된다)

논란과 의혹
사육신에 대한 가혹한 숙청
사육신의 단종복위 거사에 참여했던 한 사람인 성균관사예(司藝) 김질이 실패의 두려움 또는 장인 정창손의 회유로 장인 정창손에게 거사를 알리고 함께 세조를 찾아와 반역을 고변하였다. 세조는 즉시 성삼문 이하 주모자 6인이 모두 죄인으로 끌려와서 국문을 받았다. 세조는 사육신을 친국하였다.
세조는 사육신 본인과 자녀, 부친, 형제 및 집안 직계 남성 6백여 명을 처형하고, 집안 여성, 4촌 이상은 노비로 보내거나 변방으로 유배보냈다. 그러나 몇번에 걸쳐 공신에게 노비, 관비로 분배된 이들은 세조 말년부터 서서히 석방되었고, 중종 때에 가서는 사림파에 의해 사육신의 복권 여론이 나타나기도 했다.

회유와 박팽년의 조롱
세조는 박팽년의 재주를 사랑하여 자신에게 귀부하여 모의사실을 숨기기만 하면 살려줄 것이라고 은밀히 유시하였다. 하위지에게도 그의 재주를 애석히 여겨 은밀히 사람을 보내 다른 사육신과 함께 정변을 일으킨 것을 시인하고 사죄하면 목숨을 구해주겠다고 약속하였다. 그러나 하위지 역시 그의 회유를 뿌리쳤다.
세조는 여러번 박팽년에게 사람을 보내 회유한다. 그런데도 그는 이미 죽음을 각오한지라 웃음만 지었을 뿐 대답을 하지 않았다. 그는 세조를 가리켜 진사(進賜)라 하고 상감(上監:왕을 높여 부르는 말)이라 부르지 않았다. 세조가 노하여 “그대가 나에게 이미 '신'이라고 칭하였는데도 지금 와서 비록 그렇게 부르지 않는다고 해서 무슨 소용이 있겠느냐?”고 하자, 그는 “나는 상왕(上王:단종)의 신하이지 나으리의 신하는 아니므로 충청감사로 있을 때에 한번도 '신'자를 쓴 일이 없다.”고 대답하였다.
박팽년이 보낸 장계와 상소를 모두 갖다보니 신하 신(臣)이 아니고 클 거(巨)로 되어 있었다. 세조는 그가 충청감사로 있을 때 올린 장계를 실제로 살펴보고 과연 '신'자가 하나도 없자 더욱 노기를 띠어 심한 고문을 가하면서 함께 모의한 자들을 대라고 하였다. 박팽년은 고문을 당하면서도 서슴없이 성삼문·하위지·유성원·이개·김문기(金文起)·성승·박정·권자신(權自愼)·송석동(宋石同)·윤영손(尹令孫)·이휘(李徽)와 자신의 아비 중림이라 대답하였다. 박팽년은 혹독한 형문을 당하면서도 세조에게 상감, 주상이라 하지 않고, 진사(進賜), 나으리(羅阿里)라고 불렀다. 그는 심한 고문으로 그달 7일에 옥중에서 죽었으며, 다음날에는 다른 모의자들도 능지처사(凌遲處死) 당하였다. 그의 아버지도 능지처사되고, 동생 대년(大年)과 아들 헌(憲)·순(珣)·분(奮)이 모두 처형되어 삼대가 참화를 입었다.
하위지 역시 1456년(세조 2) 사예 김질의 고변으로 단종복위운동이 탄로나 그도 주모자의 한 사람으로 국문(鞫)을 받게 되었다. 하위지의 재주와 능력을 높이 산 세조는 여러번 하위지에게 지금이라도 늦지 않았으니 자신을 도와달라고 하지만 하위지는 이를 거절한다.
그는 국문을 받으면서 세조에게 이르기를 “……이미 나에게 반역의 죄명을 씌웠으니 그 죄는 마땅히 주살(誅殺)하면 될 텐데, 다시 무엇을 묻겠단 말이오.” 하였다. 세조는 국문장에서 그에게 자신의 편으로 올 것을 요청하였지만 하위지는 거절한다. 그는 국문과정에서 성삼문(成三問) 등이 당한 작형(灼形, 불에 달군 쇠로 죄인의 맨살에 지지는 형벌)은 당하지 않았으나, 사육신 등 여러 절신과 함께 거열형(車裂刑)을 당하였다. 그가 처형되자 선산에 있던 두 아들 호(琥)와 박(珀)도 연좌(連坐)되어 사형을 받았다. 이때 하위지의 작은 아들 박은 어린 나이였으나 죽음 앞에서 조금도 두려워하는 기색이 없었다 한다. 그는 금부도사에게 어머니와 결별하기를 청하여 이를 허락하자 어머니에게 “……죽는 것은 두렵지 않습니다. 아버님이 이미 살해되셨으니 제가 홀로 살 수는 없습니다. 다만 시집갈 누이동생은 비록 천비(賤婢)가 되더라도 어머님은 부인의 의를 지켜 한 남편만을 섬겨야 될 줄로 압니다……”고 하직한 뒤 죽음을 받자 세상 사람들이 “그 아버지에 그 아들이라!”고 하면서 감탄하였다 한다. 다른 사육신은 아들, 아버지, 형제, 조카들까지 처형하였으나 하위지에게만은 예외를 두어 그의 어린 조카들인 하포, 하원은 사형에 처하지 않고 변방으로 유배를 보낸다.

사육신의 유래
단종복위운동이 있을 때 나이가 어렸던 남효온이 성장한 뒤에 이 사건의 많은 피화자 중 충절과 인품이 뛰어난 성삼문·박팽년·하위지·이개·유성원·김문기 등 여섯 사람을 골라 그 행적을 소상히 적어 후세에 남기니, 이것이 《추강집 秋江集》의 사육신전(死六臣傳)이다. 그 뒤 사육신은 조선시대의 대표적인 충신으로 꼽혀왔으며, 그들의 신원(伸寃)을 위하여 많은 사람들이 노력해오다가 마침내 1691년(숙종 17)에 이르러 이들의 관작이 회복되게 되었다.

평가와 비판
긍정적 평가
글씨에 뛰어났다는 평이 있다.
왕권을 강화했고 국방을 튼튼히 했으며, 또 비록 그의 집권을 죽음으로써 막으려 했던 이른바 사육신 문제로 그들의 아지트였던 집현전은 폐지했으나, 법전이라든지 역사서 같은 공익적 편찬 사업을 주도하는 등, 학문을 발전시킨 공적이 높이 평가되기도 한다. 그밖에 호불(護佛)의 군주였다는 평도 있다.
세조의 치세 동안 신권이 감히 넘보지 못할 정도로 왕권은 조선 역사상 최고로 강화되었다. 그러나 세조는 인의예지신(仁義禮智信)이 아닌 강압적인 철권 통치로 나라를 다스렸으며, 새로운 인재들을 과감히 발탁하기 보다는 한명회, 신숙주 등의 측근을 중심으로 나라를 다스렸다.

부정적 평가
계유정난을 명목으로 조카 단종을 축출하고 상왕이 된 자신의 조카의 작위를 노산군으로 격하시킨 뒤 다시 그를 죽여서 큰 도덕적 결함을 가지고 있었다. 이는 그에 의해 등용된 사림파에 의해 오랫동안 비판과 지탄의 대상이 되었다. 그런데 근래에는 세조가 문종의 사망 이전부터 왕권을 탈취하려 했으며 그 결과 자신의 형인 문종을 독살했다는 의혹도 제기되고 있다. 문종의 의관 전순의(全循義)를 시켜 문종의 병을 고의로 악화시켜 빨리 죽게 만들었다는 것이다. 왕이 사망할 경우 큰 벌을 받는게 일반적이었으나 의관 전순의는 작은 형벌에 그쳤다가 다시 복귀받았으며 수양이 왕이 된 이후에 일개 의관 신분으로 일등공신으로까지 책봉을 받는다는 점에서 매우 큰 의혹을 주고 있으며 조선왕조실록에 여러 가지 정황들이 나타나고 있다. 또한 자신이 악몽을 꾸었다는 이유로 형수인 현덕왕후 권씨(단종의 어머니. 단종을 낳은지 3일만에 24세의 젊은 나이에 세상을 떠남)의 능을 파헤치고 부관참시하는 점도 비판의 대상이 된다.
또한 자신의 정통성이 약하다보니 지나치게 공신에 의존하는 정치를 펼쳐 공신들의 무법천지가 이루어지게 된다. 남의 재산을 빼앗고 온갖 횡포를 일삼아도 처벌받는 공신은 없었고 세조가 죽을 때까지 공신 견제에 실패한다. 또 자신을 조금이라도 비판하거나 반대하는 세력은 양정이나 남용신처럼 무조건 가차없이 죽여 버리기도 하였다. 홍윤성의 경우 자신의 숙부를 살해하였으므로 세조는 기회를 봐서 그를 처벌하려 하였으나, 공신들의 강한 반대에 부딛쳐 홍윤성의 노비들을 잡아다가 곤장을 치고 투옥시키는 것으로 무마시킨다. 자신이 왕위에 오르는데 큰 기여를 한 공신들을 대부분 토사구팽하여 죽인 할아버지 조선 태종에 반해, 세조는 공신들을 내치지 않았으며 내칠 수도 없었다. 오히려 우대하여 결국 훈구파 세력을 형성하는 원인이 되기도 하였다. 토지측량 기기 의상(儀象)을 스스로 제작하기도 해 15세기 과학 발달에 크게 이바지했다는 평가도 있다.
국방과 관련해서 치적도 있지만 실책도 많다. 대표적으로 의흥 삼군부를 오위 도총부로 개편하면서 갑사를 오위 중 하나인 의흥위로 몰아버리면서 부사관에 해당하는 군 계층을 사실상 없애버린 것, 지나치게 궁시 위주로 고과를 편성해서 백병전을 취약하게 만든 것, 보법으로 정군 1명당 보인이 3명으로 편성된 것을 보인 2명으로 줄어들게 해서 보인들이 대거 이탈하게 만들고 조호를 지급하는 기준을 호 기준에서 인정 기준으로 바꿔서 군인층 붕괴를 유발한 것, 총통위를 없애버린 것 등이 있다. 이러한 세조의 실책은 조선군을 약화시키는 원인이 되었다.

시
기타
안평대군과 이현로(李賢老)의 집에 있던 글과 작품들이 많았는데, 세조는 이들을 숙청한 후에 괴상한 글과 작품이라는 이유로 모두 불태워 버렸다. 안평대군은 당시 조선 최고의 명필이었다.
고모인 정선공주의 손자 남이와, 동생 임영대군의 아들인 귀성군 준을 총애하였다. 그러나 이들의 세력 확장을 경계한 예종에 의해 예종 즉위 후 남이와 귀성군은 숙청되었다.
단종의 죽음을 소재로 한 《단종애사》를 지은 소설가 춘원 이광수는 다시 그의 일대기를 소재로 한 《세조대왕》이라는 작품을 남기기도 했다.

생애
출생과 가계
그의 초기 생애는 문헌에는 나타나지 않으며, 그의 가문에 일부 전한다. 오첨(吳瞻)은 오(吳)나라 태백왕의 25세손인 오기(吳起; 초나라 재상)의 45대손이다.  서기 500년(지증왕 1년)에 중국에서 신라로 건너온 중국인 무혜공(武惠公) 오첨은 김종지(金宗之)의 딸을 아내로 맞이하여 함양에서 2남 1녀를 두고 22년간 살다가 다시 중국으로 건너갔다. 그 때 두 아들 중에 둘째 아들 오응(吳應)이 그대로 신라에 남아서 살았다고 한다. 그 후 오응의 12대손 오광우가 족질 오우경과 980년에 중국 송나라에 들어가 사천성 성도 임앙에 살았는데 다시 4대손인 오연총이 1076년(고려 문종 30년)에 다시 고려에 들어와 정착하여 살았다고 한다.

관료 생활 초반
학문에 힘써 문과에 급제했다. 1079년(문종 33년) 문과(文科)에 장원급제(壯元及第)였다.
1096년(숙종 원년) 10월 요나라에 사신으로 가서 천안절(天安節)을 하례하고 귀국했다. 1098년(숙종 3) 기거랑(起居郎)에 임명되었다가 병부낭중(兵部郎中)을 거쳐 시랑(侍郞)으로 승진했다.
1100년(숙종 5) 7월 상서(尙書) 왕하(王嘏)와 함께 송에 사신으로 가서 휘종(徽宗)의 즉위를 축하하고 이듬해 6월 귀국했는데, 이 때 송 사람들이 구입을 허락하지 않던 희귀 서적인 《태평어람》을 황제의 허락으로 구입하는 데 성공했다. 송나라 황제가 숙종에게 《태평어람(太平御覽 송 나라 때에 편찬한 백과사전 유의 책)》 1천 권을 하사하였다. 연총이 아뢰기를 ""신들이 송 나라에 있을 때에 관반(館伴) 중서사인 사문관(謝文瓘)이 신에게 말하기를, '국왕께서 글을 좋아하여 근래에 해동(海東)에 문물이 크게 일어난다는 소문이 들리고 올린 표장(表章)의 문장이 매우 아름다워 조정에서 아주 탄미한다.' 하였습니다."" 하니 숙종이, “《태평어람》은 문종(文宗)께서 일찍이 구하였으나 얻지 못했던 것이고, 《신의보구방(神醫普救方)》은 세상에 구제하는 요긴한 의서인데, 이제 짐이 두 가지를 모두 얻었으니 이것은 사신의 능력이로다. 등극을 축하하려고 갔던 사신과 봉위사(奉慰使)로 갔던 정ㆍ부 사신과 수행원의 관작을 모두 올려 주라."" 하였다.
이 공으로 중서사인(中書舍人)에 발탁되었으나, 외직으로 나가기를 자원했으므로 왕이 그를 전주목사(全州牧使)로 내보냈는데, 정사를 행하는 것이 너그럽고 공평하며 가혹하지 않으니 관리와 백성들이 안락을 누렸다.
그의 근무 고과 성적이 가장 높자, 1104년(숙종 9) 3월 소환되어 추밀원좌승선(左承宣)·형부시랑(刑部侍郞)·지어사대사(知御史臺事)에 임명되었고, 3달도 되지 않아 상서좌승(尙書左丞)·한림시독학사(翰林侍讀學士)로 승진했다. 오연총은 정사를 너그럽고 공정하게 처리하고 가혹하지 않아서 관원과 백성들이 그를 편하게 여겼다고 한다. 그러나 왕의 시험이었다는 견해도 있다. 그에 의하면 왕이 그의 장상(將相)의 재질(才質)이 있다 하여 장차 크게 쓰고자 임민(臨民)함을 시험할 목적으로 전주목사로 보냈다는 것이다.

관료 생활
같은 해 왕이 남경(南京)에 행차했을 때, 권지추밀원부사(權知樞密院副使)로서 평장사(平章事) 이오·참지정사(參知政事) 오수증(吳壽增)·판어사대사(判御史臺事) 임의(任懿) 등과 함께 호종했고, 다음 달 추밀원부사(樞密院副使)·한림학사(翰林學士), 이듬해 동지추밀원사(同知樞密院事)·비서감(秘書監)·한림학사승지(翰林學士承旨) 지추밀원사(知樞密院事)·어사대부(御史大夫)·한림학사승지, 동북면병마사(東北面兵馬使)·지행영병마사(知行營兵馬事), 동계행영병마사(東界行營兵馬使)를 차례로 거쳤다.
1106년(예종 원년) 신기군(神騎軍)의 징발 조건 완화를 건의하여 허락받았다. 같은 해 왕이 서경(西京)의 용언(龍堰)에 궁궐을 짓고 순행하는 일을 신하들에게 의논하게 했는데, 술사(術士)가 참서(讖書)를 이용해 이를 권했기 때문이었다.
이 때 오연총은 남경의 공사가 막 끝나 백성들이 피로하고 재정이 고갈되었음을 이유로 들어 반대했으나, 왕은 받아들이지 않았다.
이듬해 평장사(平章事) 최홍사(崔弘嗣) 등의 상주로 서경 궁궐 창건이 다시 거론되자, 역시 세 가지 이유를 들어 반대했으나 왕은 끝내 최홍사 등의 말을 들었고, 여론이 이를 애석하게 여겼다고 한다.

여진 정벌
같은 해 여진(女眞) 정벌이 결정되자, 오연총은 윤관(尹瓘)의 부원수(副元帥)로 임명되었고, 9성을 쌓은 후인 1108년(예종 3) 협모동덕치원공신(協謀同德致遠功臣)에 책록되고, 좌복야(左僕射)·참지정사로 옮겼다.
같은 해 웅주(雄州)에 재침입한 여진을 물리치고 개선하여, 양구진국(攘寇鎭國)의 공신호와 수사도(守司徒)·연영전대학사(延英殿大學士) 관직이 더해졌다.
그러나, 이듬해에도 여진이 재침입해 길주(吉州)를 포위해 함락될 위기에 처했다.
이에 오연총은 윤관과 함께 출정했으나, 길목인 공험진(公嶮鎭)에서 여진에게 기습을 당해 대패했다.
고려군은 다시 길주로 진군하려던 차에 여진 쪽에서 청한 화친을 받아들이게 되었고, 이를 이유로 윤관과 함께 재신(宰臣)들의 계속되는 탄핵을 받은 끝에, 1110년(예종 5) 관직과 공신호를 박탈당했다.
같은 해 표문을 올려 사양했음에도 불구하고, 수사공(守司空)·중서시랑평장사(中書侍郞平章事)·판삼사사(判三司事)로 복직되었다.

3차 여진족 토벌 출정
1107년(예종 2년)에 별무반 17만 명을 거느리고 북상, 여진촌락 129개를 쳐서 포로 1030명, 사살 4940명 등 큰 공을 세웠다. 당시 여진족은 우리 나라 동북부에서 만주에 걸쳐 살면서 북부 국경지대인 함흥 지방을 위협하자 고려의 북진 정책에 역행이 되었던 여진족을 소탕하려고 출정하였으나 누차 실패하고 심려 끝에 그 원인이 여진족의 기병임을 깨닫고 왕명을 받아 오연총은 도원수 윤관과 함께 병력을 이끌고 동북면의 여진족에게 총공격령을 내린다. 여진족 5천을 사살하고 130여 명을 생포한 뒤 이 곳에 9개의 성을 쌓아 국경을 튼튼하게 하고 돌아오니 왕은 윤관, 오연총 등의 공을 치하하고 공신에 녹훈하였다.

1107년 (고려 예종2년) 여진 정벌에 대한 조의(朝議)가 결정되어 왕은 순천관(順天館)에 출어(出御)하여 열병한 후 그와 윤관에게 은포주식(恩布酒食)을 분사(分賜)하고 공에게 고려군 부원수(副元帥)를 제수하고 윤관에게는 고려군 원수(元帥)를 제수하여 30만 대군을 주어 여진정벌(女眞征伐)의 장도(壯途)에 오르게 하였다. 그러나 그는 부원수직을 사양하였으나 윤관의 권고로 받아들인다. 윤관이 개연(慨然)하여 말하기를『오공이 아니면 누가 같이 출정하여 나라를 구하리까?』하다. 출전 할 때 왕은 경영전(景靈殿)에서 친히 부철(斧鐵:철도끼)를 내리다. 그해 여진족과 싸워 대승을 거둔다. 이어 여진족(女眞族) 조을내(兆乙乃)등 3280명이 투항(投降)하다.
여진 원정을 승리로 이끈 뒤 제장(諸將)으로 하여금 지계(地界)를 정하고 웅주(雄州).영주(英州).복주(福州).길주(吉州)등 4성을 축성(築城)하였다. 그리고 두만강 건너 선춘령(先春嶺)에 고려국 정계비(定界碑)를 세우는 것을 감독하였다.

4차 여진족 토벌 전쟁
그러나 여진족은 다시 변경을 쳐들어왔고, 1108년 (고려 예종 3년) 1월 윤관, 척준경, 왕자지 등과 함께 별무반을 이끌고 출정하였다. 그러나 가한촌(加漢村) 전투 중 험곡에서 윤관과 함께 여진족에게 포위당하고 포로로 잡히게 되었다. 그러나 척준경(拓俊京)이 후발대를 이끌고 급습하여 구하여 극적으로 살아났다. 3월 30일 포로 346명, 말 96필, 소 300두를 노획하여 포로와 전리품을 가지고 윤관 등과 함께 개경으로 개선하였다.
고려의 정벌과 9성 설치로 삶의 터전을 잃게 된 여진족은 완옌부를 중심으로 모여 무력항쟁을 계속하였고, 사자를 보내 9성을 돌려주고 생업을 편안히 해주면 자손 대대로 배반하지 않고 조공을 바치겠다고 하면서 9성을 되돌려달라고 애걸하였다. 이에 일부 주화파들은 9성을 되돌려주자고 주장하였고, 윤관과 오연총은 9성을 지킬 것을 주장하였으나 당시 고려는 여진족의 공세 앞에 9성을 지키는 것도 어려운 형편이었다. 또 9성 사이의 거리가 너무 멀어 지키기가 어려울 뿐 아니라 무리한 군사동원으로 백성들의 원망이 일어나서 조정에서도 화평론이 대세를 이루게 되었다.
1109년 9월 동덕치원공신(同德致遠功臣)의 훈호(勳號)를 내리고 상서좌복야 참지정사(尙書左僕射參知政事)가 되었으며 자수안구(紫繡鞍具)와 구마(廐馬)한 필을 하사받았다. 그러나 여진이 재침입하여 웅주를 포위하자 부원수로 병력을 이끌고 출정하여 격파하고 되돌아왔다. 9월 다시 양구진국공신(攘寇鎭國功臣)에 수사도 연영전대학사(守司徒延英殿大學士)가 되었다.

패전과 삭탈, 복직
이후 윤관과 함께 군대를 정비하던 중, 1109년 10월 여진족이 길주성을 함락시키자 동계병마부원수(東界兵馬副元帥)로서 윤관과 함께 출정, 길주성을 포위한 여진족을 다시 치려다가 공험진에서 기습공격을 당하였다. 병력을 잃고 토벌에 실패하여 화친을 맺고 돌아왔다. 그러나 11월 화친을 이유로 평장사 최홍사(崔弘嗣) 등의 탄핵을 받아 한때 관직과 공신의 자격이 박탈되고 파면되었으나 예종의 특별 배려로 다시 복직시켰다.
이후 이부상서를 거쳐 문하시랑 평장사를 지내고 1110년 중서시랑평장사 판삼사사(中書侍郎平章事判三司事)를 거쳐 1112년 수사도 판상서병부사 감수국사(守司徒判尙書兵部事監修國史), 수태위 감수국사(守司徒守太尉監修國史)를 거쳐 1113년 수태위 판예병부사(守太尉判禮兵部事)가 되고 상주국(上柱國)의 훈위를 받았으며 이어 판이부사(判吏部事)가 되었다.

말년
1112년(예종 7) 2월 27일 수사도(守司徒)·판병부사(判兵部事)·감수국사(監修國史)가 더해졌고, 같은 해 9월 12일 문하시랑 동 중서문하평장사(門下侍郞 同中書門下平章事)로 승진했으며, 이듬해 12월 다시 수태위(守太尉)·판예병부사(判禮兵部事)·상주국(上柱國), 1114년(예종 9) 판이부사(判吏部事)가 더해졌다. 1114년 추충공신(推忠功臣)에 녹훈되었다. 1114년 이후 여러 벼슬을 거쳐 수사도, 수태위, 삼수국사 상주국 판이부, 예부, 병부판사(兵部判事)를 지내고 스스로 퇴직을 청하였다. 그러나 예종은 그가 유명한 학자이자 지략을 두루 갖춘 군인임을 들어 끝까지 그의 조언을 받고자 퇴직을 윤허하지 않았다.
이후 병 때문에 여러 차례 글을 올려 사직을 청했으나, 왕은 원로인 그에게서 계속 도움을 받고 싶었으므로 이를 허락하지 않았다. 1116년 수사도(守司徒)를 거쳐 수태위 감수국사 상주국(守太尉監修國史上柱國)이 되었다.
1116년 3월 문하시중평장사(門下侍中平章事)에 제수되었다. 1116년(예종 11) 5월 향년 62세로 졸하자, 문양(文襄)이라는 시호를 받았다. 왕은 그의 장례 때 모든 신하들이 참석하도록 했다.
아들이 없던 그는 조카뻘 되는 친척 오익(吳翊)을 양자로 입계(入系)하고 딸 1명은 윤관의 아들에게 출가하였다.

사후
사후 함경남도에 사우(祠宇)가 세워졌다. 그 뒤 1441년(세종 23년) 함경북도 북청 안북사(按北祠)에 배향되었고, 1925년 전남 곡성군 오곡면 덕산리에 덕산사(德山祠)가 건립되어 제향되었다. 1925년 3월 함경남도에 있던 문양공 사우에서 영정을 복사하여 덕산사에 봉안했으며, 덕산사는 남한 땅에 단 한곳 밖에 없는 유일한 오연총의 사당이다. 그의 후손과 유림들이 매년 음력 3월 3일 제를 올리고 있다.

평가
《고려사》에서는 오연총에 대해 그의 열전에서 이렇게 평했다.

여진족을 토벌하고 강동 6주와 동북 9성을 쌓아 북방의 방어력을 높인 점을 높이 평가받는다. 평화시에는 문신으로 임금을 모셨고 전시에는 장군으로 나라를 지키고 국가에 충성을 다하는 문무를 겸비했다는 시각도 있다.

가족 관계
딸 : 오씨, 윤관의 며느리
아들 : 오익(吳翊)

영정
원래의 영정은 조선시대 초기에 제작되었으나 한국전쟁 도중 실전되었고, 현재 전하는 것은 1925년 3월 그의 후손이 함경남도 산천군에 있는 사당에서 그림을 모사해온 모사본이다.
무속의 신의 한사람으로도 숭배되었다.

기타
사돈의 유래
고려 예종 때 여진을 함께 정벌한 도원수 윤관과 부원수 오연총은 아들과 딸의 혼인으로 맺어진 관계이기도 했다. 어느 봄날 술이 잘 빚어진 것을 본 윤관은 하인에게 술동이를 지게하고 오연총의 집으로 향했다. 그런데 전일 밤에 내린 소낙비로 물이 불어나 개울을 건널 수가 없었다. 안타까움에 발을 구르고 있는데 개울 건너편을 바라보니 오연총도 술통을 옆에 두고 발을 구르고 있는 것이다. 잠시 후 두 사람은 개울을 사이에 두고 등걸나무 조각을 구해 걸터앉았다. 먼저 윤관이 술잔을 비운 뒤 개울 건너 오연총에게 잔 권하는 시늉을 했다. 오연총도 머리를 숙여 술잔을 받는 예를 표시한 뒤 스스로 채운 술잔을 비웠다. 이렇게 둘은 등걸나무(査)에 걸터앉아 서로 머리를 숙이며 술잔을 주고받는 시늉을 하며 풍류를 즐겼다. 이때부터 자식 사이의 혼인을 제안할 때는 '사돈 하자'라는 말이 유래하게 되었다 한다. 사돈의 뜻은 등걸나무(査)에 머리를 숙이다는 뜻의 돈수(頓首)의 합성으로 등걸나무에 앉아 머리를 조아린다는 뜻이다.

동명이인 오연총
중국에서 건너온 일족인 오인유(吳仁裕)의 후손 중에 고려 후기의 문신인 오연총(吳延寵)있다. 그의 시호는 양평공(良平公)이며 다른 이름은 오정총이다. 250년의 연대 차이가 나며 이 둘을 구별하기 위해 시호를 앞에 붙여 문양공 오연총과 양평공 오연총으로 부른다.
문양공 오연총의 6대손 오현보는 1216년(고려 고종 3년) 거란족의 침략을 격퇴하였다. 양평공 오연총의 5촌 당조카인 오선경(吳先敬)은 조선 정종 때의 인물로, 1399년(정종 1년) 식년 문과에 병과로 급제했다. 그러나 간혹 조선시대부터 양평공 오연총(오정총)과 문양공인 그를 헷갈리는 문헌도 존재한다.

출생
출생과 어린 시절
그의 어머니 조씨가 그를 수태했을 때, 꿈에 유성(流星)이 품속으로 드는 것을 보고 원효를 임신하였으며 만삭(滿朔)이 된 몸으로 집근처인 상주(湘州) 경산현 압량군(押梁郡)의 망이 끈어졋음. 
조씨는 남편의 털옷을 밤나무에 걸고 원효를 낳았는데 이 나무를 사라수(娑羅樹)라 불렀다. 그곳 밤나무의 밤은 크기도 크고 굵으며 맛이 특이하여 사라율(裟羅栗)이라 불렀다.
원효는 나면서부터 총명하고 남보다 뛰어났으며, 기억력이 뛰어났다. 그는 일찍이 고향에서 한학을 배우다가 유교를 가르치는 태학에 입학하였다. 원효는 스승을 따라 배울 것이 없었다. 그는 어려서부터 부친 담날과 조부 잉피공의 기대를 받으며 화랑으로 활동하였다.

출가와 수행
15세 때 또는 28세 때 어머니 조씨의 죽음에 충격을 받고, 삶과 죽음에 대해 오래 고민하다가 출가하여 승려가 되었다. 황룡사에 들어갈 때 집을 희사하여 초개사(初開寺)를 세우게 했으며, 자신이 태어난 사라수 옆에도 절을 세워 사라사(裟羅寺)라 하였다.
그가 출가를 결심했을 때 아버지 설담날과 할아버지 잉피공의 실망이 대단하였다 하며, 그에게는 형 설을신이 있었으므로 처음에는 출가를 반대하였으나, 그의 뜻이 확고하자 허락하였다.

영취산의 낭지(郎智), 흥륜사의 연기(緣起)와 고구려 반룡산(盤龍山)의 보덕(普德) 등을 찾아다니며 불도를 닦으니 뛰어난 자질과 총명이 드러났다.고려 大覺國師 義天이 남긴 詩에 의하면 원효는 義湘과 함께 고구려 고승으로서 백제 땅 전주 孤大山으로 옮겨 간 普德和尙의 講下에서 「열반경」과 「유마경」 등을 배웠다고 한다. 「삼국유사」智來雲條에는 원효가 좌高寺에 있을 때 靈山 都木匠의 智가 그로 하여금「初章觀文」과 「安身事心論」을 쓰게 하였으므로, 원효가 그 글을 지어 智에게 전달하면서 그 글 끝에 ‘西谷沙彌稽首禮 東岳上德高岩前……' 이라 하여 자신을 사미라 낮추고 상대방인 낭지를 上德으로 높이고 있으니, 이로 보아 원효가 낭지에게 師事하였거나 단순히 學德높은 老和尙으로 존경하였던 것으로 짐작된다. 또「삼국유사』의 釋惠空傳에는 원효가 혜공에게 問學한 사실을 보이고 있다. 즉 당대의 神 혜공이 그 만년 恒沙寺에 있을 때, 원효가 諸經疏를 찬술하면서 어려운 문제가 있을 때에는 언제나 혜공에게 가서 질의하였다는 것이다.

당나라 유학 시도와 깨달음
원효는 당시의 지식인들과 마찬가지로 선진 문물을 배우기 위해 34세와 45세 때 의상과 함께 두 번에 걸쳐 당나라 유학을 시도했다.
원효는 34세 때인 650년(진덕여왕 4년) 의상과 함께 당나라 고승 현장에게 불법을 배우러 가다가 요동 근처에서 고구려 순라군(국경경비대)에게 잡혀 첩자로 오인받았다가 풀려났다.

그는 661년(문무왕 1년) 다시 의상과 함께 당나라로 유학을 가던 길에 당항성 근처의 한 무덤에서 잠이 들었다. 그는 잠결에 목이 말라 달게 마신 물이 다음날 아침에 깨어나 다시 보니 해골바가지에 담긴 더러운 물이었음을 알고 급히 토하다가 삼계유심(三界唯心)의 원리, 일체유심조의 진리를 깨달아 유학을 포기한다.“곧 마음이 일어나므로 갖가지 현상이 일어나고, 마음이 멸하니 땅막과 무덤이 둘이 아님을 알았다”
그 뒤 원효는 분황사에 있으면서 독자적으로 통불교(通佛敎)를 제창하며 민중 속에 불교를 보급하기에 노력했다. 그는 분황사에 주석하면서 화엄경소(華嚴經疏)를 저술하다가 화엄경소의 제4 십회향품(十廻向品)에서 절필(絶筆)했다.(삼국유사4)

혼인과 아들 설총
하루는 마음이 들떠 거리에 나가 노래하기를 ""누가 자루 없는 도끼를 내게 주겠느냐, 내 하늘을 받칠 기둥을 깎으리로다(誰許沒柯斧 我斫支天柱).""라고 하니 사람들이 듣고 그 뜻을 몰랐으나, 태종무열왕이 이를 듣고 ""대사가 귀부인을 얻어 슬기로운 아들을 낳고자 하는구나. 나라에 큰 현인이 있으면 이보다 더 좋은 일이 없을 것이다.(此師殆欲得 貴婦産賢子之謂 爾國有大賢 利莫大焉)""라 했다. 요석궁에는 과부가 된 무열왕의 둘째 딸인 요석공주가 있었는데, 왕이 궁리(宮吏)에게 명하여 금성시내에서 춤추며 노래부르는 원효를 찾아 데려가라 했다. 궁리가 명령을 받들어 시내로 나가 원효를 찾자, 그는 이미 남산(南山)에서 내려와 문천교(蚊川橋)를 지나다가 관리를 만났는데, 그가 자발적으로 혹은 관리가 떠밀어서 일부러 물에 빠져서 옷을 적셨다. 이후 무열왕은 공주에게 옷을 말리고 쉬게 하도록 명을 내려 원효와 공주를 맺어주었다.
요석공주는 설총을 낳았는데, 고려의 승려 일연은 설총이 한국 유교의 시조라 하여 '지금(일연이 살던 당시)도 우리 나라에서 명경(明經)을 업(業)으로 하는 사람이 이를 전수(傳受)해서 끊이지 않는다.'고 하였다.

입적(죽음)
수많은 저서를 남기고 70세 되던 해 혈사(穴寺/경주시 양북면 소재 골굴사)에서 입적에 들었다.

사상
원효는 한국은 물론이고 중국과 일본의 승려들에게도 많은 영향을 미쳤다. 특히 유식학(唯識學)이나 불교논리학 등에 있어서 그의 영향력은 매우 크다.

화쟁(和諍)사상과 일심(一心)사상
그는 불교 사상을 연구함에 있어 어느 一宗,一派에 구애됨이 없이 “萬法이 一佛乘에 총섭되어야 하는 것은 마치 大海 중에 일체 衆流가 들어가지 않음이 없는 것과 같다”(금강삼매경론)고 하여 大·小승, 性·相,頓·漸의 상호대립적인 교의를 다 융회하여 一佛乘에로 귀결시키려 하였다. 이러한 그의 사상은 “뭇 경전의 부분적인 면을 통합하여 온갖 물줄기를 한 맛의 진리 바다로 돌아가게 하고, 불교의 지극히 공변된 뜻을 열어 모든 사상가들의 서로 다른 유論들을 和會시킨다”(열반경종요)라는 말로 요약할 수 있는 和諍 바로 그것이라 할 수 있다.
그런데 원효의 이 화쟁 방법 내지 사상은 근원적으로는 석가 이전 인도의 베다 사상(Vedism)에서 찾아볼 수 있다. 인도 철학의 碩學 라다크리슈난 (Radhakrishnan, S.)에 의하면 인도 원주민을 정복한 아리안 (Aryans)의 종교는 처음부터 광범하고, 자기 발전적이고, 관대하여 성장해 감에 따라 그가 만나는 새로운 힘들은 자기 안으로 융화시키고, 보다 낮은 종교를 무시하거나 그 존재를 말살하기 위하여 싸우거나 하지 않았다는 것이다. 즉 그들의 것만이 유일하고 참된 종교라는 광신은 없었다고 말하고 있다. 이러한 인도인들의 사유 경향이 印度佛敎에서 和의 사상을 있게 한 것이라 볼 수 있다. 석가는 당시 수많은 사상체계들이 서로 대립, 충돌을 일으키는 形而上學的 문제에 대한 논쟁에 끼어든 적이 없었다. 왜냐하면 형이상학적 문제에 대한 논의는 진실한 실천적 인식에는 아무런 도움이 되지 않기 때문이었다. 그는 진실하게 살아가는 길과 진실에 대한 실천적 인식을 사람들에게 가르치려 했을 뿐, 베다의 권위를 배척하고 모든 형이상학적 논의를 무의미한 것으로 간주했다. 거시적이고 객관적인 관점에서 본다면 이러한 형이상학적 주장들은 모두가 상대적이고 일반적인 것이기 때문이었다. 불교에 있어서의 和의 원리는 이처럼 실천 원리를 중시하는 석가에서 그 싹이 나타난 셈이고, 이는 대중 교화에 뜻을 두어 眞俗一如를 주장한 대승 불교 후기에까지 면면히 지속된 정신이라 할 수 있다. 석가 이후 1200여 년 만에 신라통일기에 나타난 원효가 실천을 중시하면서 和諍 사상의 기치를 높이 든 것은 바로 석가 이후 대승에 이르기까지의 和의 정신의 시대적 재현 내지 재창조라 보아야 할 것이다.
원효의 수많은 저서 가운데 이 화쟁의 방법에 의하여 眞俗不二의 사상을 나타내려 한 대표적인 것으로 「대승기신론 소」 「대승기신론 별기」를 들 수 있다.
「대승기신론」은 산스크리트 원본이 없는 탓으로 印度撰述인가 中國撰述인가가 논란되어 오기도 하지만, 대승불교 시대의 후기에 나타난 불교사상서중 가장 뛰어난 논서로 알려져 있다. 「대승기신론」은 인도에서 그 당시 대립되고 있던 양대 불교 사상, 즉 中觀派와 伽(唯識)派의 사상을 지양 · 화합시켜 眞과 俗이 전혀 별개의 것이 아니라 우리 인간들이 迷汚한 현실생활(俗) 가운데에서 깨달음의 세계로 끊임없이 추구하고 수행함에 의하여 완성된 人格(眞)을 이루어 갈 수 있으며, 한편 깨달음의 단계(眞)에 이른 사람은 아직 染汚한 단계(俗)에 있는 중생을 이끌어 갈 의무가 있는 것임을 주장함으로써 眞俗一如의 사상을 잘 나타낸 논서이다.
원효는 이 「대승기신론」을 만나자마자 바로 자신의 구도적 학문과 삶의 자세와 너무도 일치함에 크게 감명을 느꼈던 것으로 보인다. 그러기에 그는 「대승기신론」에 대하여 무려 7種의 연구서를 냈고, 특히 그의 「대승기신론 소」 「대승기신론 별기」는 일찍부터 중국의 불교 학계에서까지 높이 평가되어 마지 않았던 것이다.
「대승기신론」(이하 「기신론」이라 약칭함)에 대한 연구로는 일찍부터 慧遠, 元曉, 法藏의 주석서를 三大流로 지칭하고 있으나 혜원의 것은 僞撰이라는 說과 함께 質로나 量으로 보아 원효의 것에 훨씬 미치지 못한다. 법장의 것은 원효의 것을 그 分科와 語句解釋에 있어 거의 그대로 답습하고 있어 원효의 「기신론 소」 「기신론 별기」야말로 최고의 기신론 연구서라 할 수 있다.
원효의 기신론관을 논하기 전에 먼저 기신론 本文의 구조와 내용을 소개하기로 하자.
기신론은 因緣分, 立義分, 解釋, 修行信心分, 勸修利益分 등의 다섯 부분으로 구성되어 있다. 因緣分에서는 이 논을 짓게 된 이유를 말하였고, 立義分에서는 이 논의 대의, 즉 一心, 二門, 三大를 제시하였다. 解釋分은 앞서의 입의분에서 제시한 一心, 二門을 구체적으로 논술한 것으로 기신론 중에서 가장 핵심적인 부분이다. 이 부분은 다시 顯示正義, 對治邪執, 分別發趣道相의 셋으로 나뉜다. 우선 正義를 드러냄에 있어서 -心(衆生心)을 心眞如門과 心生滅門의 둘로 크게 구분하였다. 心眞如門에서는 如實空, 如實不空 등을 말하여 마음의 淸淨한 面을 묘사하였으며, 心生波門에서는 阿黎耶識의 覺과 不覺의 二義와 薰習 등을 말하여 마음의 染淨緣起를 밝혔다. 다음으로 邪執을 對治함에 있어, 人·法 二執의 對治를 말하고, 마지막으로 發心 修行하여 道에 나아감을 분별하는 상에서는 信成就發心, 解行發心, 證發心의 세 가지 발심을 말한다. 修行信心分에서는 앞서의 해석분 중의 발취도상이 不定聚衆生중의 勝人을 위한 설명임에 비하여 여기서는 부정취중생 중의 人을 위하여 四信, 五行 및 他力念佛을 설한다. 마지막 勸修利益分에서는 이 논을 믿고 닦으면 막대한 이익이 있으리라는 것을 말하였다. 이상의 것을 도표로 나타내면 다음과 같다.
이제 원효의 기신론관에서 특징적인 것 몇가지를 들고자 한다.
첫째, 원효는 그의 「기신론 소」 「기신론 별기」에서 기신론의 성격을 中觀思想과 唯識思想의 止揚·綜合이라고 판석한다. 즉 「기신론」은 마음의 청정한 면만을 주로 찬탄하고 강조해 온 中觀사상과 마음의 염오한 면을 주로 밝혀 은 유가사상을 잘 조화시켜 眞俗不二의 뜻을 밝힌 것이라 본 것이다. 이는 「기신론」이 一心을 心眞如門과 心生滅門의 둘로 크게 나눈 후, 심진여문에서는 마음의 청정한 면을 묘사하고 심생멸문에서는 마음의 염정연기를 밝히고 있는 데서 매우 타당한 견해라 할 수 있다. 더욱이 원효의 이러한 해석은 「기신론」 출현의 시기에 인도 불교 사상계에서 중관파와 유가파가 서로 첨예하게 대립되고 있었던 역사적 사실에도 부응하는 것이다.
원효를 거의 그대로 답습한 법장은 이점에 있어서는 견해를 달리하여 「기신론」을 如來藏緣起宗이라 판석하였다. 원래 여래장 사상은 중국 화엄종의 선구인 地論宗 南道派들에 의하여 성하게 연구되어 왔던 것으로, 화엄종의 第3祖인 법장은 이들 지론종 남도파의 영향에 의하여 「기신론」을 여래장 연기종이라 판정한 것이다. 또한 「기신론」을 연구하는 대부분의 일본 학자들은 법장설을 무비판적으로 추종하여 「기신론」을 여래장 연기종설로만 알고 있고, 심지어는 법장설에서 일보 나아가 여래장 연기 종파가 역사상 실재했다고까지 주장하는 학자(勝又俊敎)도 있다. 그러나 漢字를 모르는 인도의 불교 학자나 歐美의 학자들은 여래장 연기종이라는 이름조차 모르며(高崎直道), 또 일부 일본 학자중에는 중국 화엄가들의 「기신론」이해를 재검토해야 한다는 입장을 취하고 있기도 하다(柏木弘雄).
勝又 등 일본 학자들의 여래장 연기 종설은 재론할 가치도 없거니와 「기신론」을 화엄가의 管見으로 본 法藏의 여래장 연기 종설 또한 원효의 판석보다 보편성이 적은 견해라 하지 않을 수 없다.
둘째, 원효는 그의 「기신론 소」와 「기신론 별기」에서 우리의 迷妄한 마음, 즉 無明이 본래의 청정한 마음 즉 진여를 훈습하여 不覺心이 처음으로 일어난 無明業相, 이 무명업상 즉 極微한 動念에 의하여 所緣境相을 볼 수 있게 되는 轉相, 그리고 이 전상에 의하여 境界를 나타내는 現相 등 세 가지 미세한 마음, 곧 三細識이 아라야식 (Ãlayavijñāna)位에 해당된다고 주장하였다. 원효의 이 三細·아라야식설은 「기신론」 본문에 직접적으로는 明示되어 있지 않지만 주의깊게 精讀한다면 「기신론」 자체의 논술에서 충분히 입증할 수 있는 것으로(拙稿, 원효의 三和·아라야식설의 創案 참조) 이는 법장에 의하여 그대로 답습되었고 그 뒤 일본학자들이 이에 대하여 찬·반의 두 가지 입장을 취하고 있는 터이다.
원효는 「기신론」의 기본구조인 一心 二門에서 먼저 二門 중 心眞如門을 中觀學派의 주장으로, 心生滅門을 유가학파의 주장으로 보았다고 할 수 있으며, 이 二門이 一心으로 귀결되는 데서 「기신론」의 성격을 중관·유식의 지양·조화 내지 眞·俗을 別體로 보려는 고집을 꺾는 것이라 단정한 것 같다. 다음, 「기신론」에 心生滅門내에서 自性淸淨한 如來藏의 不生滅心이 生滅心과 和合하여 같은 것도 아니고 다른 것도 아닌(非一非異) 아라야식이 존재하게 되며, 따라서 이 아라야식에는 覺義와 不覺義의 義가 있게 된다고 한 것에서 원효는 이 아라야식의 二義性을 앞서 一心二門의 구체적 표현으로 보았다고 할 수 있다. 원효가 이러한 二義和合識으로서의 아라야식에 三細라는 미세한 마음들을 배대한 것은 唯識家에서의 아라야식이 막연한 潛在心으로 묘사되고 있는 것에 비하여 「기신론」의 아라야식은 세 가지의 미세한 마음으로 구체화되었음을 밝혀 놓은 것이다. 또 유식가의 아라야식은 異熟識으로서 輪廻의 주체일 뿐, 깨달음의 淨法을 낼 수 없는 生滅識일 뿐이지만, 「기신론」의 아라야식은 和合識으로서 그 중의 不覺 즉 生滅分인 業相, 轉相, 現相이 除滅되면 바로 그 자리가 不生不滅分 즉 自性淸淨心이 되어 覺의 상태가 되는 것이다.
이처럼 원효가 三細라고 하는 還滅의 구체적 단계를 제시한 것은 心源 즉 깨달음의 경지로 환멸해 가는 修行面에 있어 보다 실천적인 입장을 취한 것이라 할 수 있으며, 그리하여 이 三細·아라야식설은 중관·유식학파의 양대 주장의 조화라는 「기신론」의 성격을 더욱 극명하게 드러낸 것이라 하겠다.
셋째, 원효는 아라야식의 覺義에 의하여 자성청정한 覺의 상태로 환멸한 후의 本覺의 성격 즉 智淨相과 不思議業相에 대하여 自利와 利他의 두 가지 면으로 배대시킴으로써 心源에 도달한 覺者는 깨달은 상태(自利)에 安住하지 말고 중생의 이익을 위하여 적극 노력해야 함(利他)을 역설한다. 이것은 俗 가운데에서 眞으로 향해 가는 길(上求菩提)을 명시했던 앞서의 三細·아라야식설에 비하여 이제는 眞으로부터 俗으로 돌아와 중생과 더불어 호흡을 같이함을 의미하는 것이니 바로 下化衆生이다. 그의 이러한 自利·利他의 兼修 즉 眞俗不二의 사상은 그의 力著이며, 「기신론」의 이론을 많이 인용하고 있는 저「金剛三味經論」의 全篇에서도 누누이 강조하고 있는 不住涅槃 바로 그것이라 할 수 있다.

결국 원효가 「기신론 소」와 「기신론 별기」에서 강조하고자 한 것은, 眞俗一如, 不住涅槃의 사상이었으니, 이는 出世間的 自利만이 불교의 진의가 아니고 모든 사람들이 다 함께 깨달음의 세계를 이룩해야 한다(利他)는 대승불교의 정신이 아닐 수 없다. 또 그는 여기에서 더 나아가 彌陀淨土說과 「十念論」 등을 통하여 일반 대중들이 보다 쉽게 깨달음의 세계로 갈 수 있는 길을 제시하려 하였고, 종국에는 집필의 붓을 꺾고 下化衆生을 위한 실천의 길로 뛰어들었다. 이에서 이론면에서나 실천면에서 上求菩提,下化衆生의 정신을 누구보다 강력하게 구현한 한국의 뛰어난 求道者 원효의 모습을 볼 수 있는 것이다.

대중 교화를 통한 실천
스스로 실계한 원효는 소성거사(小性居士)라 자칭하면서 속세의 복장을 하고 마을에 나다니다가 우연히 한 광대가 괴상한 박을 가지고 춤과 만담을 벌이는 것을 보고, 그와 같은 물건을 만들어 《화엄경》의 '일체무애인(一切無碍人) 일도출생사(一道出生死)'에서 '무애'를 따라가 박의 이름을 짓고 〈무애가(無碍歌)〉라는 노래를 지어 춤추고 노래하며 여러 마을을 돌아다녔다. 이에 세상 사람 중 염불을 할 줄 모르는 사람이 없게 되었으니 원효의 교화가 그렇게 컸다. 그러나 원효의 춤과 노래에 많은 사람들이 몰려들어 광대들이 생계에 지장있음을 호소하자 그는 이를 그만두었다.원효는 淨無二, 眞俗一如라는 그의 학문적 이론을 당시의 신라 사회에서 대중과 함께 몸소 실행에 옮겼던 드문 실천가였다. 당시 신라 사회는 圓光과 慈藏의 교화에 큰 영향을 입었으나, 불교의 受容面에서 왕실을 中心으로 하는 귀족층과 일반 서민층 사이에는 아직도 괴리가 있었다. 이러한 때에 惠空, 惠宿, 大安 등이 대중 속으로 깊이 파고들어가 대중들에게까지 불교를 일상생활화시킴으로써 유익한 의지처가 되게 하였다.
원효 역시 이들의 뒤를 이어 당시의 승려들이 대개 성내의 대사원에서 귀족생활을 하고 있었던 것에 반하여, 지방의 촌락, 街巷 등을 두루 돌아다니며 無得박을 두드리고 “모든 것에 걸림없는 사람이 한 길로 生死를 벗어났도다”라는 구절로 노래를 지어 부르면서 가무와 잡담 중에 佛法을 널리 알려 일반 서민들의 교화에 힘을 기울였다. 그가 이처럼 서민 대중의 교화에 나선 것은 입당 포기 후 心法을 깨달은 후이며, 요석 공주와의 失戒로 스스로 小姓居士라 자칭하던 때 이후로 보여진다. 또 그가 스스로 小姓居士라 부른 것은, 失成로 인한 속죄의 한 방법이었다기보다는 오히려 대중 교화의 방편이었던 것으로 짐작된다. 이는 대중 교화의 선구자인 惠空이 등에 삼태기를 지고 街卷에서 大醉 歌舞한 것이나, 大安이 특이한 옷차림으로 장판에서 銅鉢을 치면서 “大安,大安”외친 경우와 같은 것으로 볼 수 있기 때문이다. 그러기에 그는 대중 교화의 행각을 마친 뒤에는 다시 소성거사 아닌 원효 화상으로 돌아가 穴寺에서 생애를 마쳤던 것이다.

유교와 경학
원효는 불교뿐만 아니라 도가와 유가에도 밝았고, 한비자와 상앙의 법가 사상에도 지식이 많았다. 특정한 스승 없이 영취산의 낭지, 고구려의 보덕, 항사사(현 오어사)의 혜공 등에게서 배웠다고 한다. 그의 저술에 나타나는 인용문을 통하여 그가 불교학 전반에 걸쳐 서뿐만 아니라, 「논어」나 「노자」, 「장자」 등 유가서와 도가서에도 정통하고 있음을 볼 때, 광범위한 분야에 걸친 그의 修學經歷을 짐작할 수 있다.

명상법
7세기 원효는 3세기 용수가 만든 대승불교의 승려였다. 그러나 12세기 중국 대혜종고가 간화선을 개발한 것이기에, 원효는 전통적인 불교 명상법인 수식관을 익혔을 것이다. 또한, 화랑이었기 때문에 도교의 조식법을 익혔을 것이다.
오늘날 간화선이 지배하는 한국 불교에서 원효가 별로 논의대상이 아닌 것은, 명상법이 달라서라고 할 수도 있다. 대한불교 조계종은 7세기 당나라 육조혜능을 헌법에 명시하여 중요시하는데, 7세기 신라의 원효는 오조 홍인대사 때의 승려이다.

삼국통일에 미친 영향
원효는 불교를 대중화시키고, 분열된 국민정신을 통합하기 위해 많은 노력을 기울였다. 고구려, 신라, 백제에서 당대 가장 고승이었던 원효대사가 신라에서 살았고 고구려, 백제를 멸망시키고 삼국을 통일했다. 삼국통일에는 당나라가 큰 역할을 하였는데, 원효는 당시 많이들 읽는 모든 불경에 대해 각각 해설서를 편찬할 정도로 불교에 자유자재했고 통달해 당시 당나라 고승들이 원효대사를 매우 존경하고 좋아했다. 당시 동북아 국가들의 왕은 최고의 고승을 국사, 왕사로 두어 각종 정책결정에 권고를 받았었다. 오늘날, 의상이 당나라로부터 수입해 한국화 한 화엄사상과 더불어 원효의 화쟁사상과 일심사상은 삼국통일의 사상적 토대를 마련했다 평가 받는다.

저서
그 연구 범위도 小·大승, 경·율·론 등 거의 모든 부문을 다 망라하고 있어 그야말로 초인간적인 學解와 저술활동이라 아니할 수 없다. 더욱이 그의 대표적 저술이라 할 수 있는 「大乘起信論疏」와「金剛三味經論」에서 보인 탁월한 이해와 견해는 중국의 석학들마저 찬탄과 경이를 아끼지 않을 정도였다.원효는 100여 종의 240여 권 (또는 85종의 170여 권)의 저술을 한 것으로 알려져 있지만, 현존하는 것은 20부 22권뿐이다. 이 중 《대승기신론소》 2권, 《금강삼매경론》 3권, 《십문화쟁론》 2권 등은 원효의 대표작이라 할 수 있는데, 원효 사상의 핵심인 일심(一心)사상과 화쟁(和諍)사상이 잘 나타나 있다. 현존하는 것 중 일부는 다음과 같다.
《(十門和評論)십문화쟁론》
《열반경종요(涅築經宗要)》 1권
《대승기신론소(大乘起信論疏)》 2권
《대승기신론별기(大乘起信論別記)》 1권
《대해도경종요(大慧度經宗要)》 1권
《금강삼매경론(金剛三味經論)》 3권
《발심수행장 / 대승육정참회》
《중변분별론소(中邊分別論疏)》 第2 권
《무량수경종요(無量壽經宗要)》 1권
《이장의(二障義)》 1권
《법화경종요(法華經宗要)》 1권
《화엄경소(華嚴經疏)》 第3권

가계
원효는 신라의 개국공신이자 박혁거세를 추대한 사로 6촌의 촌장 중의 한사람인 설거백 또는 설호진의 후손 으로, 설곡(薛嚳)의 4대손이다.
원효는 잉피공의 손자이자 내말(奈末, 육두품 출신이 맡는 제11등급 관직) 설담날(薛談捺)과 조씨(趙氏)의 둘째 아들이다.
원효의 조부인 잉피공의 집이 금성에 있었으므로 원효를 금성 사람이라고도 한다.
잉피공(仍皮公)은 또는 적대공(赤大公)이라고도 하는데, 고려시대 중기 김부식과 일연이 살던 시대까지도 경주 적대연(赤大淵) 옆에 잉피공의 사당이 존재하고 있었다.
원효에게는 형제가 몇 있었는데, 경주 설씨와 순창 설씨의 족보에는 그의 형 중 1명인 설을신(薛乙臣)의 이름이 현재 전한다.
원효는 경주 설씨와 순창 설씨의 중시조인 설총의 생부다.

원효가 등장하는 작품

《삼국기》 (KBS 1TV, 1992년, 배우: 서학)

관계
신라의 고승 의상(義湘)을 사제(師弟)로 삼아 사형제지간(師兄弟之間)을 이루었다.

기타
그가 탄생한 마을 이름을 불지촌(佛地村)이라 하고 처음으로 중창한 법당의 이름을 초개사(初開寺)라 하였으며 법명을 스스로 원효라 한 것은 모두 불교의 빛이 널리 퍼진다는 뜻이다. 또한 불교사상을 통한 한국 사상사의 새벽을 연 것으로 볼 수 있다.
원효대사의 아들 설총은 중국 한자를 한국식 발음에 맞춘 이두의 창시자이자 이두 문학의 창시자였다. 설총은 최치원·강수 등과 함께 신라 3대 문장가로 꼽힌다. 그는 9경(주역·시경·서경·예기·춘추·논어·맹자·주례 등)을 처음 우리말로 해석하여 유교 사상을 널리 전파하였다.
후일 고려시대에 인종때 원효대사의 18대손 설자승(薛子升)은 이자겸의 난 당시 화를 피해, 순창으로 옮겨가 순창 설씨의 시조가 되었다. 다른 후손인 설귀창의 후손들은 그대로 경주 설씨로 이어갔다.

각승 일화
바다 용(龍) 또는 임금의 부탁을 받은 원효는 노상에서 조서(詔書)를 받아 <삼매경소(三昧經疏)>를 지었는데, 삼매경소를 다 지은 뒤 원효는 붓과 벼루를 소의 두 뿔 위에 놓아 이를 각승(角乘)이라 했다. 이를 들은 대안법사(大安法師)가 구경온 사람들의 인파를 헤치고 와서, 소뿔위에 서 있는 붓과 벼루에 종이를 붙였는데 후일 일연은 '이것은 또한 지음(知音)하여 서로 창화(唱和)한 것'이라고 평하였다.

대처승
원효를 한국 최초의 대처승이라 보는 관점이 있다. 일본 제국주의의 강점과 사찰령을 통한 한국 전통 불교의 파괴 이후 한국에는 대처승이 유행하였다. 한국불교에서 일제를 찬양하는 왜색을 몰아내고 전통을 복원한 역할을 한 이승만의 불교정화운동 당시 대처승들의 승직이 박탈되었으나, 이후에도 대처승은 계속 존재하고 있다. 일제의 영향이 빠져나간지 오래인 현대 한국에서 대처승에 대한 다양한 관점이 존재한다. 고려시대에 대처승이 고려에서 일본으로 전래되기도 하였다.

민간신앙
원효는 한국의 무속신의 하나로도 숭배되는데, 그의 사상적 영향과 함께 서민 대중에게 친근하게 다가갔음을 생각하면 그러한 숭배가 이해된다 볼 수 있다. 숭배의 기제로 해골의 물을 마신 것을 죽음을 극복한 것으로 보는 것이 작동한다 추정할 수도 있다.

생애
출생과 가계
윤관은 파평현(坡平縣)에서 검교소부소감(檢校少府少監) 윤집형의 아들로 출생하였다.
윤관의 아버지 윤집형은 삼한공신(三韓功臣) 윤신달의 증손자로 벼슬은 검교소부소감을 지냈다. 그의 가계는 고려 삼한공신 윤신달의 후손으로 윤신달 이전의 가계는 미상이다. 그가 공신이 되고 명장으로 이름을 날렸기에 그를 중심으로 고조부까지만 기록된 것으로 전한다.
부인 경원 이씨는 이성간(李成幹)의 딸로, 슬하에 윤언이(尹彦頤)·윤언순(尹彦純)·윤언식(尹彦植)·윤언이(尹彦頤)·윤언민(尹彦旼)을 두었으며, 이 중 두 사람은 승려가 되었다.
윤언이는 『고려사(高麗史)』에 열전이 수록되었고, 윤언순은 예종(睿宗) 때 시어사(侍御史)를 거쳐 남원부사(南原府使)에 이르렀으며, 윤언식은 타고난 자질이 고상하고 우아하여 빈객을 좋아하였는데, 벼슬은 수사공 좌복야(守司空 左僕射)에 이르렀다. 윤언민은 다른 사람보다 총명하고 서화(書晝)를 잘하였으며, 인종(仁宗) 때에 상식봉어(尙食奉御)가 되었다. 이와 같이 그의 가문은 상당히 번성하여, 이후 왕실과 혼인을 하는 등 당대의 명문으로 거듭났다.

초기 관직 생활
과거 급제와 관료생활 초반
윤관은 문종 때에 문과에 급제하여 습유(拾遺)· 보궐(補闕) 등을 지냈고, 1087년(선종 4) 합문지후(閤門祗候)가 되었다. 그해 합문지후로서 출추사(出推使)가 되어 광주(廣州), 충주, 청주를 시찰하고 되돌아왔다.
1095년(숙종 즉위) 좌사낭중(佐司郞中)이 되었으며, 그해 숙종(肅宗)이 즉위하자 바로 형부시랑 임의(任懿)와 함께 국신사(國信使)로 요나라에 사절로 파견되어 숙종의 즉위를 알렸다. 1098년(숙종 3) 중서사인(中書舍人)을 거쳐 동궁시학사(東宮侍學士)가 되었으며, 동궁시학사로 재직 중 조규(趙珪)와 함께 송나라에 다시 사절단으로 파견되어 숙종의 즉위를 알리고 귀국하였다.
1099년 우간의대부·한림시강학사(右諫議大夫翰林侍講學士)가 되었으나 당시 좌간의대부(左諫議大夫) 임의와 인척이어서 간원(諫院)인 어사대(御史臺)에 같이 있을 수 없다는 중서성(中書省)의 건의로 따라 스스로 물러났다. 1101년 추밀원지주사(樞密院知奏事)가 되었고, 9월에 남경개창도감을 설치되자, 평장사(平章事) 최사추(崔思諏)등과 양주에 파견퇴어 궁궐터를 물색하는 등 남경건설사업을 활발히 추진했다. 그리하여 1104년 5월 지금의 서울지역에 남경궁(南京宮)을 건설되었다.
1102년 지공거(知貢擧)가 되어 이굉(李宏) 등과 함께 진사시험(進士試驗)을 주관했고, 이어 어사대부, 추밀원부사 등을 지냈다. 1103년 이부상서(吏部尙書) 겸 동지추밀원사(同知樞密院事)를 거쳐 지추밀원사 겸 한림학사승지(知樞密院事兼翰林學士承旨)에 올랐다.

개혁 정책
숙종 때에 여러 벼슬을 지내고 동궁시강·어사대부·이부상서·한림학사 승지 등을 지냈다.
숙종 재위기간 중 그는 대각국사 의천과 함께 숙종의 측근으로 활동하였다. 동시에 의천과 함께 시정개혁을 담당하여 왕권을 강화하기 위해 남경 건설, 금속화폐 유통책 실시와 신법(新法)을 제정, 실시했다. 또 기존의 호족들을 억압하고 과거 시험과 추천제로 신진 관료들을 선발하였다.
고려의 동북면과 연결된 갈라전(曷懶甸) 일대에 거주하던 여진 부족들은 고려의 국경지대를 왕래하며 그들의 토산물을 부족한 생필품과 무역하고 있었다. 또한 이들 부락의 추장들 중 일부는 고려를 종주국으로 삼고 입조하였는데, 고려는 그들 추장들에게 무산계(武散階)나 향직(鄕職)을 주어 회유하기도 하고, 투항해오는 여진족에게는 투화전(投化田)을 주어 정착시키기도 했다. 숙종 즉위 초, 그는 여진족 추장들을 만나 왕의 대리인으로서 여진족 추장들에게 관직을 하사하고 추장들을 면담하였다. 그러나 여진족 추장들은 1106년을 전후해 우야소(烏雅束)를 중심으로 통일부락을 건설하면서 고려를 공격할 계획을 세운다.
1103년(숙종 8)에 우야소의 세력은 함흥부근까지 들어와 주둔하게 되었다. 고려군과 우야소의 여진군은 충돌 직전에 들어갔으며 이듬해 완안부의 기병이 정주관(定州關) 밖에 쳐들어오게 되었다. 1103년경부터 여진족 정벌 여론이 나오면서 여진족을 토벌해야 된다는 입장을 고수하였다. 숙종대 후반에 제기되는 여진정벌론에는 여진족의 흥기와 고려 동북면 침입이라는 객관적 정세 변화 외에 국내의 정치상황도 한 요인으로 작용했다.

여진족 정벌
별무반 조직과 3차 여진족 토벌전쟁
1107년(예종 2년)에 여진족의 동태가 심상하지 않다는 한 변장(邊將)의 긴급보고를 접하자 여진족 토벌을 주청하였다. 이에 왕명으로 여진 정벌군의 원수(元帥)가 되어 별무반이라는 특수 부대를 이끌고 부원수에 임명된 지추밀원사 오연총(吳延寵)과 17만 대군을 거느리고 여진족 정벌에 출정하였다. 당시 여진족은 우리 나라 동북부에서 만주에 걸쳐 살면서 북부 국경지대인 함흥 지방을 위협하자 고려의 북진 정책에 역행이 되었던 여진족을 소탕하려고 출정하였으나 누차 실패하고 심려 끝에 그 원인이 여진족의 기병임을 깨닫고 왕명을 받아 윤관은 오연총과 특수부대 17만을 거느리고 여진촌락 135개를 쳐서 포로 1030명, 사살 4940명 등 큰 공을 세웠다.
1107년 12월 원수가 되어 오연총(吳延寵)과 17만 명의 군사를 중·좌·우의 3군으로 편성했으며 수군(水軍)까지 동원해 여진정벌에 나섰다. 고려군은 일거에 쳐들어가 여진족을 쫓아내고 9성을 쌓았다. 처음 여진족을 공격하는 척 하다가 후퇴한 뒤, 여진추장에게 사자를 보내 고려가 앞서 잡아둔 여진족 허정(許貞)· 나불(羅弗) 등을 돌려보내겠다고 거짓통보를 하자, 여진족 추장은 400여명의 호송 병력을 보내왔는데, 이때 윤관과 오연총은 이들을 유인하여 거의 섬멸시키고 사로잡았다. 이들을 미끼로 여진족을 유인하게 하고, 이후 윤관은 따로 5만3,000명을 편성하여 거느리고 정주에 도착한 뒤 중군(中軍)은 김한충(金漢忠), 좌군(左軍)은 문관(文冠), 우군(右軍)은 김덕진(金德珍)으로 하여금 군사를 지휘하게 하였으며, 수군(水軍)은 선병별감(船兵別監) 양유송(梁惟) 등이 2,600명으로 도린포(都鱗浦)의 바다로부터 공격하였다.
윤관군의 기습공격에 눌린 여진이 퇴각하여 동음성(冬音城)으로 숨자 정예부대를 편성하여 추격, 여진족이 재기할 틈을 주지 않고 바로 격파하였으며, 다른 여진군이 숨은 석성(石城)은 척준경(拓俊京)을 시켜 공격, 패주하게 하여 섬멸하였다.

승전과 동북9성 수축
여진족의 전략적인 거점을 무찌른 곳은 135개처, 적의 전사자 4,940명, 포로 130명을 생포하였다. 이후 조정에 전승의 보고를 올리고 탈환한 각지에 장수를 보내 국토를 획정하고 오연총과 함께 9성의 축조를 감독하였다. 현재 9성의 확실한 위치는 밝혀져 있지 않으나 흔히 함주(咸州)·영주(英州)·웅주(雄州)·길주(吉州)·복주(福州)·공험진(公鎭)·통태진(通泰鎭)·진양진(眞陽鎭)·숭녕진(崇寧鎭)으로 비정되고 있다. 학자에 따라서는 진양진·숭녕진 대신 의주(宜州)·평융진(平戎鎭)을 꼽기도 한다. 윤관은 남쪽지방의 민호(民戶)를 이곳으로 옮겨 살게 했다. 〈고려사〉 윤관전에 기록되어 있는 영주청벽기(英州廳壁記)에 의하면 당시 이주한 가구의 수는 함주·영주·웅주·길주·복주·공험진에 병민(兵民) 6,466정호(丁戶)였다.
9성을 쌓은 뒤 예종에게 건의하여 남쪽으로부터 백성을 이주시켜 남도지방의 이주민들이 이곳을 개척하여 살게 되었다. 남도의 이주민으로 6성을 쌓은 뒤 별도의 군대를 편성하여 지키게 하였고, 이 6성 외에 1108년 초 숭녕(崇寧)·통태(通泰)·진양(眞陽)의 3성의 수축을 명하여 감독, 9성을 설치하였다.
특히 함흥평야의 함주에 대도독부(大都督府)를 두어 이곳이 가장 요충이 되었다. 9성을 완공한 뒤 재침하는 여진을 평정하고 1108년(예종 3년) 출발, 회군하였다. 오연총과 함께 9개의 성벽을 쌓아 국경을 튼튼하게 하고 개선하자 예종은 그와 오연총에게 공신호를 내렸다.여진족을 몰아내고 북진 정책을 완수한 공으로 영평(파평)백에 봉해져 후손들이 본관을 파평으로 하였다. 그러나 고려가 9성을 개척하게 되자 그곳을 근거지로 웅거하던 완안부의 우야소는 반발하여 1108년초에 군사를 이끌고 함경북도 지역을 재침략하여 정면대결을 하게 된다.

4차 여진족 토벌 전쟁
그러나 여진족은 다시 변경을 쳐들어왔고, 1108년 (고려 예종 3년) 1월 오연총, 척준경, 왕자지 등과 함께 별무반을 이끌고 다시 출정하였다. 그러나 가한촌(加漢村) 전투 중 험곡에서 윤관은 오연총과 함께 여진족에게 포위당하게 되었다. 그러나 척준경(拓後京)이 후발대를 이끌고 급습하여 구출되었다.
영주성 공략에서는 왕자지가 이끄는 군대가 패퇴하였으나 역시 척준경의 용맹과 기지로써 왕자지를 구출하고 여진군을 겨우 물리치게 되었다. 그는 숙종대 왕권강화시책의 한 주역이었고, 예종 즉위 초기의 정책 수행과 여진정벌 추진에서도 중심세력으로 활약했다. 그러나 우야소는 다시 여진군 수만명을 이끌고 쳐들어와 웅주성을 포위하였다. 역시 척준경의 지략과 용기로써 적을 패주시켰다. 1108년 3월 30일 포로 346명, 말 96필, 소 300두를 노획하여 포로와 전리품을 가지고 개경으로 개선하여 추충좌리평융 척지진국공신(推忠佐理平戎 拓地鎭國功臣)에 책록되고, 문하시중(門下侍中) 겸 판상서이부사 지군국중사(判尙書吏部事 知軍國重事)에 임명되었다. 이어 영평현개국백(鈴平縣開國伯) 식읍(食邑) 2,000호, 식실봉(食實封) 300호에 봉해졌다.

생애 후반
여진족과의 화전과 동북9성 반환
한편, 윤관이 예종에게 신임을 받는 것을 부정적으로 보던 관리들이 윤관을 비방하였으나 왕이 듣지 않았다. 고려의 정벌과 9성 설치로 삶의 터전을 잃게 된 여진족은 완안부를 중심으로 모여 무력항쟁을 계속하였고, 사자를 보내 9성을 돌려주고 생업을 편안히 해주면 자손 대대로 배반하지 않고 조공을 바치겠다고 하면서 9성을 되돌려달라고 애걸하였다. 이에 일부 주화파들은 9성을 되돌려주자고 주장하였고, 윤관과 오연총은 9성을 지킬 것을 주장하였으나 당시 고려는 여진족의 공세 앞에 9성을 지키는 것도 어려운 형편이었다. 또 9성 사이의 거리가 너무 멀어 지키기가 어려울 뿐 아니라 무리한 군사동원으로 백성들의 원망이 일어나서 조정에서도 화평론이 대세를 이루게 되었다.
서쪽에 강력한 요나라와 접경하고 있던 여진은 고려와 평화를 회복하는 것이 매우 필요하게 되었으나, 윤관의 9성 축조와 농업이주민으로 말미암아 농경지를 빼앗긴 토착 여진족으로서는 강력히 반발할 수 밖에 없었다.
드디어 여진은 적극적인 강화교섭을 개시하였으며 7월 3일 예종은 육부를 소집, 회의를 열고 9성을 동여진 우야소에 되돌여주는 것을 논의하기에 이르렀다. 평장사 최홍사(崔弘嗣) 등 28명은 찬성하고, 윤관과 오연총, 예부낭중(禮部郎中) 한상(韓相)은 반대하였으나 당시 조정은 화평으로 기울어 있었고, 결국 9성을 여진족에게 돌려주기로 결정하고 7월 18일부터 9성에서 철수하기 시작했다.
뒤에 금나라 태조 아골타(阿骨打)가 금나라를 세워 강대한 국가가 된 기반에는 그들이 9성을 다시 되찾은 데 그 원인이 있었다고 보는 시각도 있다.

공신호 삭탈과 생애 말년
1109년 5월 길주성이 여진족에게 함락될 위기에 처하자 동계병마부원수(東界兵馬副元帥) 오연총과 함께 출정하였다. 그러나 길주성을 포위한 여진족을 다시 치려다가 공험진에서 기습공격을 당하고 공략에 실패, 화친을 맺고 돌아왔다. 11월 여진족의 계속된 침범을 막지 못한 책임으로 재상 최홍사(崔弘嗣) 등의 탄핵을 받아 한때 관직과 공신의 자격이 박탈되고 파면되었다. 명분 없는 전쟁으로 국력을 탕진했다 하여 처벌하자는 주장도 대두되었다. 회군해서는 왕을 만나지도 못하고 집으로 되돌아갔다. 그러나 그는 숙종대를 이어 예종대에도 왕권강화를 위한 정책을 충실히 수행한 정치세력이었으므로, 흔히 패군한 장수가 영구히 관직을 삭탈당하는 것과는 달리 예종의 특별 배려로 다시 복직하였다.
예종 5년(1110년) 복관되었고, 오히려 예종은 윤관에게 문하시랑 평장사를 주고 가까이 있도록 하였다. 그러나 윤관은 나이가 많고, 제대로 일을 할 수 없기 때문에 곧 사직했고, 그 뒤 독서에 몰입하던 중 그 해 수태보 문하시중(守太保門下侍中) 겸 판병부사 상주국 감수국사(判兵部事上柱國監修國史)에 임명되자 윤관은 표문을 올려 사직을 청하였으나 예종은 허락하지 않았다. 윤관이 다시 사퇴하려 하였으나 예종은 역시 받아들이지 않았다. 1111년에 세상을 떠났다고 한다.

사후호
시호는 문숙(文肅)이다. 시호는 당초에 문경(文敬)이었으나 인종때 문경왕태후(文敬王太后)로 추존 된 예종비의 휘호를 피하기 위해 문숙(文肅)으로 고쳤다. 1130년(인종 8년) 예종의 묘정(廟廷)에 배향되었다. 사후 무속에서 신으로 숭배되기도 했다. 묘는 경기도 파주군 광탄면(현 파주시 광탄면)에 있다. 윤관의 묘는 사적 제323호로 지정되었다.

윤관 장군 묘를 둘러싼 산송
경기도 파주시 광탄면 분수리 산 4-1에 위치한 윤관 장군 묘역(사적 제323호)은 조선시대부터 400여 년 동안 계속된 산송으로도 유명하다.
1614년 영의정을 지낸 심지원이 윤관 장군 묘를 파헤치고 부친 등 일가의 묘를 잇따라 조성하자, 이에 반발한 파평 윤씨가 1763년에 심지원의 묘 일부를 파헤치고 청송 심씨에 대한 처벌을 요구하였다. 다툼이 발생한 고양 지역의 군수는 명문가의 다툼에 개입하기를 꺼려 이 문제를 조정에 넘겼다. 결국 당시 임금이었던 영조는 윤관의 묘와 심지원의 묘를 그대로 두고 양 가문이 합의하도록 종용했다. 파평 윤씨와 청송 심씨가 조선시대에 왕비를 각각 4명, 3명씩 배출한 외척 가문이었기 때문에 영조도 섣불리 한쪽의 손을 들어주기 어려웠기 때문이다. 그러나 파평 윤씨 가문에서 이에 불복하여 심지원의 묘를 이장해야 한다고 주장하다가 오히려 곤장을 맞고 귀양가다 병사(病死)하는 등, 두 가문의 불화는 더욱 깊어졌다. 오늘날에 이르러서도 이 문제를 해결하기 위해 여러 노력이 있어 왔으나 번번이 실패했다.
2006년 음력 4월 10일, 파평 윤씨 대종회와 청송 심씨 대종회는 파평 윤씨 측이 이장에 필요한 부지를 제공하고 청송 심씨 측이 윤관 장군 묘역에 조성된 청송 심씨 조상 묘 19기를 이장하기로 합의하면서 조선시대부터 392년 동안 이어진 묘지 다툼을 끝내기로 하였다.

기타
숙종대에 고위직으로 진급하고 출세한 데에는 며느리(윤언영尹彦榮 = 윤언식으로 추정됨)가 숙종비인 명의태후(明懿太后)의 동생이었던 사실이 작용했던 듯하다는 시각도 있다.

전승
전승에 따르면, 윤관이 함흥 선덕진 광포(廣浦)에서 거란군에게 쫓길 때 잉어가 도와서 강을 건넜다는 전승이 있어서, 지금도 파평 윤씨 가문에서는 잉어를 먹지 않는다고 한다.

김부식과 윤언이
글씨를 잘 써서 여러 글과 묘비명, 작품 등을 남겼으나 상당수 실전되었다. 그가 쓴 대각국사 의천의 묘갈명을 김부식이 임의로 수정하고 내용을 바꾸어버리자 이를 불쾌하게 여긴 그의 아들 윤언이는 김부식과 앙숙이 되었다.

평가와 비판
여진족을 토벌하고 동북 9성을 쌓아 북방의 방어력을 높인 점을 높이 평가받는다. 또한 만년에 공신호를 삭탈당하고 불우한 최후를 맞이한 것에 대한 동정 여론도 있다.

사돈의 유래
고려 예종 때 여진을 함께 정벌한 도원수 윤관과 부원수 오연총은 아들과 딸의 혼인으로 맺어진 관계이기도 했다. 어느 봄날 술이 잘 빚어진 것을 본 윤관은 하인에게 술동이를 지게하고 오연총의 집으로 향했다. 그런데 전일 밤에 내린 소낙비로 물이 불어나 개울을 건널 수가 없었다. 안타까움에 발을 구르고 있는데 개울 건너편을 바라보니 오연총도 술통을 옆에 두고 발을 구르고 있는 것이다. 잠시 후 두 사람은 개울을 사이에 두고 등걸나무 조각을 구해 걸터앉았다. 먼저 윤관이 술잔을 비운 뒤 개울 건너 오연총에게 잔 권하는 시늉을 했다. 오연총도 머리를 숙여 술잔을 받는 예를 표시한 뒤 스스로 채운 술잔을 비웠다. 이렇게 둘은 등걸나무(査)에 걸터앉아 서로 머리를 숙이며 술잔을 주고받는 흉내를 내며 거나하게 마셨다. 이때부터 자식 사이의 혼인을 제안할 때는 '사돈 하자'라는 말이 유래하게 되었다 한다. 사돈의 뜻은 등걸나무(査)에 머리를 숙이다는 뜻의 돈수(頓首)의 합성으로 등걸나무에 앉아 머리를 조아린다는 뜻이다.

생애
유학과 교육
20세에 출가하여 650년(진덕여왕 4년)에 사형(師兄)인 원효(元曉)와 함께 당나라에 가던 도중에 난을 당해 당항성의 어느 동굴에서 유숙하게 되었다. 이때 해골에 괸 물을 마신 원효는 도의 길이 따로 있지 않다는 일체유심조의 진리를 깨닫고 당나라 유학을 포기하고 그와 헤어진다.
그 후 신라의 삼국통일 전쟁의 혼란을 피하여 661년(문무왕 1년)에 당나라 사신의 배편을 빌려 타고 건너가 중난산(終南山) 지상사(至相寺)에서 지엄(至嚴: 중국 화엄종의 제2대 조사)의 문하에 현수(賢首: 법장)와 같이 화엄의 깊은 이치를 깨달았다. 현수는 지엄의 뒤를 이어 중국 화엄종의 제3조가 되고, 의상은 귀국 후 한국 화엄종의 시조가 된다.

당나라에 체류 중 그의 설법에 참석하던 여성 중 그를 사모하는 선묘라는 이름의 여성이 있었다고 한다. 의상은 그녀의 마음을 알고 있었음에도 불구하고 그녀의 마음을 받아들이지 않고, 대신 자신의 제자로 삼았다. 의상이 신라로 귀국하던 날, 선묘의 집에 찾아갔지만, 선묘가 집을 비워서 만나지 못하고 돌아갔다. 의상의 귀국 소식을 접한 이 선묘는 자신이 죽어 그를 지켜주겠다며 황해바다에 몸을 던져 죽었다. 후에 의상이 영주 봉황산에 산사를 지을 때, 지역 주민들이 와서 집단으로 들고 일어서자 어느 날 사람 수백 명의 머리를 덮고도 남을 크기의 바위가 공중에 떠다니면서 주민들을 따라다녔다. 겁에 질린 주민들은 자발적으로 해산하였고, 의상은 사찰을 준공하였다고 한다.

수행과 정진
의상은 670년(문무왕 10)에 귀국하여 관음굴(觀音窟: 낙산사)에서 백일을 기도하고 676년에 왕의 뜻을 받아 봉황산에 부석사를 창건하고 화엄교학을 강술하여 화엄종(해동 화엄종)의 시조가 되었다.
692년(효소왕 1)에 현수는 승전(勝詮)이 귀국할 때 그의 저술 《화엄경탐현기》와 그 비판을 구하는 서신을 의상에게 보냈는데, 그 친필 서신이 오늘날까지 전하고 있다. 의상은 문하에게 이것을 나누어 강술하면서 전교(傳敎)에 전심하다 죽었다. 사망 당시 향년 78세였다.

사후
후일 고려 숙종은 해동화엄시조원교국사(海東華嚴始祖圓敎國師)라 시호하였다. 의상의 문인으로 뛰어난 10대덕과 전교(傳敎)의 10대찰이 있었다.

철학세계
화엄경의 무애 사상등으로 잘 알려진 신라의 고승 원효(元曉)와 동문수학하여 연배인 원효와 사형제지간(師兄弟之間)인것으로 알려져있다. 또한 의상의 철학세계에 대해 ' 세계는 하나의 거대한 그물이고 씨줄 날줄이 교차되는 곳에 살아 있는 것들이 있는데, 그중 하나가 죽으면 전체 세계가 다 울려서 내 마음도 아파온다'라는 표현으로 강신주 철학교수는 이를 언급한바있다.

일화
의상의 귀국에 관하여 다음과 같은 이야기가 전해지고 있다. 즉 당나라는 삼국 통일을 원조하였음에도 불구하고, 신라가 여제(麗濟) 양국을 공취한 것에 노하여 신라 승상 김흠순(金欽純)을 잡아 가두었다. 당 고종(高宗)이 신라에 대거 출병코자 한 기미를 김흠순 등에게 들은 의상은 급히 귀국하여 왕께 고하고 명랑(明朗)이 밀단법(密壇法)을 베풀어 화를 면했다고 한다.
범어사의 전설에 따르면, 흥덕왕 때에 왜병이 내침한다는 소식을 듣고 금정산(金井山)에 빌어서 미연에 방지하였다고 하나 근거 있는 것은 아니다.

의상이 등장하는 작품
《원효대사》 (KBS, 1986년~1986년, 배우 : 안승훈)

기타
의상은 영주의 부석사, 양양의 낙산사 등 화엄 10찰을 건립하였다. 토에 정통한 승려로서 신라와 고려에서는 국사로 추존되었으며, 민간 신앙에서도 무속의 신 중 한 사람으로 경상북도의 일부 무당들로부터 숭배되었다.

생애 전반
어린 시절
한성 건천동(현재의 서울특별시 중구 을지로18길 19 신도빌딩)에서  이정(李貞)과 초계 변씨(草溪 卞氏)의 셋째 아들로 1545년 4월 28일 태어났다. 어린 시절의 대부분을 건천동에서 보냈고, 외가인 아산에서 소년기를 보냈다. 이정은 자신의 네 아들에게 고대 중국의 성인으로 알려진 복희, 요 임금, 순 임금, 우 임금의 이름자를 붙여 첫째부터 이희신(李羲臣), 이요신(李堯臣), 이순신(李舜臣), 이우신(李禹臣)으로 지었다.
고려 때 정5품 신호위 중랑장(中郎將)을 지낸 덕수이씨의 시조 이돈수(李敦守)의 12세손이며, 조선 초 예문관 대제학, 영중추부사(領中樞府事) 등을 역임한 정정공(貞靖公) 이변(李邊)의 후손이다. 증조부 이거(李琚)는 정언, 이조좌랑, 통덕랑 수(守)사헌부장령, 1494년 연산군이 세자시절 세자시강원보덕 등을 지내고, 연산군 즉위 초에는 통훈대부(정3품 당하관)로 승진, 장악원정, 한학교수를 지냈으며, 연산군 초에 춘추관편수관으로 《성종실록》의 편찬에 참여하고, 순천도호부사, 행호군을 거쳐 최종 병조참의에 이르렀다.
조부 이백록(李百祿)은 흔히들 조광조와 가깝게 지내던 중 1519년(중종 14) 조광조의 기묘사화에 연루되어 화를 입고, 이후 생애를 마감할 때까지 관직에 나가지 않았다고 알려져 있지만 사실과 다르다. 조부 이백록(李百祿)은 1522년(중종 17) 생원시에 합격과 동시에 음서로 관직에 오를 수 있었으나 나아가지 않고 오랫동안 성균관 생원으로 있었다. 이후 문과에는 급제하지 못하였으며 1534년(중종 29)과 1540년(중종 35) 사이에 선교랑 평시서 봉사를 지냈다. 아버지 이정(李貞)은 음서로 관직에 올라 1573년(선조 6) 병절교위를 거쳐 1576년(선조 9) 종5품 창신교위를 지냈다. 어머니 초계변씨는 생원 변성의 딸이다.

무과 급제
1565년 이순신은 방씨(方氏)와 혼인하고 보성군수를 지낸 장인 방진의 후원으로 병학을 배우면서 무과(武科)를 준비하였다. 28살이던 1572년(선조 5년) 훈련원 별과(訓錬院 別科)에 응시했으나 시험을 보던 중, 말에서 낙마하여 주변 사람들이 기절한 줄 알았으나 옆에 있던 버드나무 껍질을 벗겨 다리를 동여매고 시험을 끝까지 치렀다. 하지만 결국 시험에서는 낙방하고 만다.
4년 뒤인 1576년(선조 9년) 그의 나이 32살에 식년시(式年試) 무과에 병과(丙科) 제4인로 급제하여 권지훈련원봉사(權知訓練院奉事)(훈련원 봉사 실습생으로, 정식 직책이 아니다.)로 처음 관직에 나섰다. 조선시대 무과 합격자 분석에 의하면 당시 그의 나이는 현대인의 상식과 달리 늦은 나이에 과거에 급제한 것이 아니다. 급제 후 1576년 12월에 동구비보 권관을 거쳐 1579년에는 10개월간 해미에서 훈련원 봉사로 근무하였다. 훈련원 봉사 재직 중 자신의 친구를 훈련원 참군으로 추천하는 병조정랑 서익의 요청을 거절했다. 그 뒤 36세가 되던 1580년 7월에 전라도 발포의 수군만호(水軍萬戶)로 전근되었다. 발포는 현재의 전라남도 고흥군 도화면 발포리이다.
발포수군만호 재직 중 전라좌수영의 오동나무를 베기를 거부하여 전라좌수사 성박(成博)의 미움을 받았다. 성박은 군관을 시켜 거문고를 만들기 위해 관사에 있는 오동나무를 베어오게 했지만 사사로운 목적을 위해 나라의 재산인 나무를 벨 수 없다 하여 이를 거절했다. 그러자 성박은 후임자에게 이순신에 대한 부정적인 평을 남겼고, 후임 전라좌수사 이용은 이순신을 밉게 보았다. 이용은 좌수영 관하의 다섯 포구인 발포, 여도, 사도, 녹도, 방답진을 점검하였다. 이때 다른 4개의 포구 이탈자는 보고하지 않고, 이순신이 지휘하는 포구의 3명만 보고하였다. 이순신은 다른 4개 포구의 결과를 조사하여 보고하려 하자, 이용은 즉시 장계를 회수하였다. 이용은 그의 근무성적을 최하로 매겼는데, 전라도도사(都事)로 재직 중이던 조헌(趙憲)은 고과내용을 보자 부당한 처사라며 항의하여 수정하게 했다. 나중에 이순신의 인물됨을 알아본 이용은 생각을 바꾸어, 함경남도 남병사로 전근한 뒤 1583년 이순신을 자신의 군관으로 추천하기도 했고, 건원보 권관으로 천거하였다.
1582년 1월 발포만호로 재직 중일 때 서익이 군기경차관으로 고흥군에 왔다. 이때 서익은 발포진을 찾아가 군기보수 불량이라는 이유로 그를 파직시켰다. 그러나 곧 복직하였다. 1583년 함경남도병사 이용의 추천을 받아 남병사의 군관이 되었다가, 1583년 8월 건원보 권관으로 천거되어 나갔다.
그 후 북방 국경 지대인 함경도로 가서 여진족 방어를 맡았으며, 1586년(선조 19년)에 사복시 주부가 되었고, 이어 조산만호(造山萬戶) 겸 녹도 둔전사의(鹿島 屯田事宜)가 되었다. 한편 그를 유심히 지켜본 병조판서 김귀영은 1579년 자신의 서녀를 그에게 첩으로 주려 하여 불렀다. 그러나 어찌 권세가의 집에 드나드느냐며 그 제의를 거절하였다.

녹둔도 전투, 첫 번째 백의종군
1587년(선조 20년) 조산보만호 겸 녹도 둔전사의 이순신에게 녹둔도의 둔전을 관리하도록 하였다. 그해 가을에는 풍년이 들었다. 그해 9월 1일 이순신이 경흥부사 이경록과 함께 군대를 인솔하여 녹둔도로 가서 추수를 하는 사이에 추도에 살고 있던 여진족이 사전에 화살과 병기류를 숨겨놓고 있다가, 기습 침입하여 녹둔도 전투가 벌어졌다. 녹둔도 전투에서 조선군 11명이 죽고 160여 명이 잡혀갔으며, 열다섯 필의 말이 약탈당했다. 하지만 이일이 도망치는 와중에 이순신은 이경록과 남아서 싸웠고 그 결과 승리했으며 조선인 백성 60여 명을 구출했다. 이 과정에서 이순신의 무예는 대단했는데 고작 수십명의 병사들로 1,000기의 여진족 기병을 상대로 방어에 성공했으며 반격하여 무찔렀다.
당시 조산만호 이순신은 북방 여진족의 약탈 및 침략을 예상하고 수비를 강화하기 위하여 여러차례 북병사 이일에게 추가 병력을 요청하였으나, 모두 거절 당하였다. 이 패전으로 인해 책임을 지게 된 북병사 이일은 이순신에게 그 책임을 덮어 씌우고 이순신은 죄를 받아 수금되었고 백의종군(白衣從軍)하게 되었다.
전투의 결과를 북병사 이일(李鎰)은 녹둔도 함몰이라고 비판하였다. 처음부터 군사 10명이 피살되고 106명이 포로가 되었으며 말 15필을 빼앗기는 등의 피해가 많았다 하여 이 녹둔도 사건으로 인해서 함경도 북병사 이일(李鎰)의 비판으로 문책받고 그해 10월 해임, 결국 투옥되었다. 북병사 이일은 이경록과 이순신을 투옥한 뒤, 1587년 10월 10일 ""적호(賊胡)가 녹둔도의 목책(木柵)을 포위했을 때 군기를 그르쳤다""고 장계를 올려 이를 보고하였다.
이일은 장계를 올려 사건의 결과에 대한 책임을 물어 이경록과 이순신을 군율로 극형에 처하여야 한다고 이경록과 이순신을 모함했다. 그러나 이때 이경록 등을 변호한 이는 이억기 등 소수였다. 10월 16일 선조는 한번의 실수로 사형은 과하다며, 북병사에게 장형(杖刑)을 집행하게 한 다음 백의종군(白衣從軍)하게 하라고 지시했고, 조정에서는 백의종군하게 하여 입공자속(立功自贖)할 기회를 주라고 권고하였다.
선조는 이일이 이순신을 모함하고 있다는 사실을 눈치챘으나 선조가 당대 조선의 맹장인 신립의 눈치를 보고 있었는데 이일은 정치적으로 신립과 같은 파벌이었으므로 선조는 신립을 분노하게 할 수 없어서 어쩔 수 없이 이경록과 이순신을 처벌은 하되, 참수형이 아닌 백의종군으로 일단락 시켰다. 선조가 이일의 모함을 알고 있었기에 가능한 조치였으며 만약 이일의 모함을 선조가 몰랐더라면 이경록과 이순신을, 이일의 건의대로 참수형에 처했을 것이다. 
명백히 이순신은 싸워 이긴 것이며 모든 잘못이 이일 혼자에게만 있었음에도 불구하고 선조는 이일이 신립과 친분이 깊다는 점 때문에 신립에게 잘 보이기 위해 이일에게 처벌하지 않고 이순신에게 처벌했다. 조선군 11명 전사와 160명이 포로로 잡힌 것은 이일이 그렇게 한 것이며 이순신과 이경록은 이를 뒷수습하기 위해 고군분투를 했을 뿐이다. 실제로도 이순신은 이일에게 지원 병력을 요청했지만 이일이 이를 거절해서 이렇게 된 것이다. 현재도 녹둔도의 일은 용인 이씨 가문에서 계속 왜곡하고 있다.
이후 이순신은 북병사 휘하에서 종군하며 1588년의 2차 녹둔도 정벌에서 여진족 장수 우을기내(于乙其乃)를 꾀어내어 잡은 공으로 사면을 받아 복직되었다.

무관 생활
그 후, 전라도감사 이광(李珖)에 의해 군관으로 발탁되어 전라도 조방장(助防將)·선전관(宣傳官) 등이 되었다. 1589년(선조 22년) 1월에 비변사(備邊司)가 무신들을 다시 불차채용(순서를 따지지 않고 채용)하게 되자 이산해(李山海)와 정언신의 추천을 받았다. 7월에  있어서 선정을 배풀어 백성들로부터 칭찬이 자자하였다. 1590년 8월 조정에서는 그를 종3품의 직책인 고사리진과 만포진의 첨사로 거듭 삼으려 했으나, 지나치게 진급이 빠르다는 이유로 논핵되어 개정되었다.
1591년 2월에 선조는 이천·이억기·양응지·이순신을 남쪽 요해지에 임명하여 공을 세우게 하라는 전교를 내렸다. 선조는 신하들의 반발과 논핵을 피하기 위해 벼슬의 각 단계마다 임명하여 제수하고 승진시키는 방법을 써서 1591년 2월 이순신을 종6품 정읍현감에서 종4품 진도군수(선조가 다시 비변사에 ""이경록과 이순신 등도 채용하려 하니, 아울러 참작해서 의계하라""는 전교를 내렸다. 1589년 12월에 류성룡(柳成龍)이 천거하여 이순신은 정읍현감이 되었다. 관직에 오른 지 14년 만이었다. 고을을 다스리는 데 선정을 베풀어 백성들로부터 칭찬이 자자하였다. 珍島郡守)로 승진시켰고, 그가 부임지에 부임하기도 전에 종3품 가리포첨절제사(加里浦僉節制使)로 전임시켰다. 이어 선조는 이순신이 가리포에 부임하기도 전에 다시 정3품 전라좌수사에 전임하게 하였다. 또한, 선조는 이순신과 같이 백의종군을 하였던 이경록도 전라도의 요지인 나주목사에 제수하였다. 계속되는 대신들의 반대에도 불구하고 선조는 이순신을 수사로 삼으려는 심지를 굳혔다. 그는 이경록의 발탁은 천천히 생각하여 결정하겠다고 하면서도 이순신의 수사 발탁은 개정은 할 수 없다고 하며 밀어붙였다.
1591년 이순신은 47세에 정3품 당상관인 절충장군(折衝將軍) 전라좌도 수군절도사에 발탁되어 임명되었다. 이후에도 부제학 김성일(金誠一) 등 많은 신하가 그의 경험이 모자라다는 것을 이유로 들어 그와 같은 선조의 결정을 반대하였으나, 선조는 이순신을 신임하였다. 한편 이순신은 부임지에 부임하자마자 전쟁에 대비하고자 휘하에 있는 각 부대의 실태를 파악하였으며, 무기와 군량미를 확충하고 거북선을 개발 및 건조하는 등 군비를 강화하였다.
임진왜란 발발 직전인 1592년에 이순신은 일본은 섬이니 일본의 수군이 강할 것이라고 예단해 수군을 육지로 올려 보내 수비를 강화하라는 조정의 명에 대하여 이순신은 “수륙의 전투와 수비 중 어느 하나도 없애서는 아니 되옵니다.”라고 주장하였다. 그 결과 임진왜란이 일어나기 직전 이순신의 감독아래에 있던 전라좌수영은 20여 척(최소 26척 최대 29척)의 판옥선을 보유할 수 있었다.

임진왜란
1592년(선조) 5월 23일(음력 4월 13일)에 고니시 유키나가가 이끌던 일본군 함대 700척이 오후 5시경 부산포를 침략하여 임진왜란이 발발하였다. 당시 선봉군의 병력은 약 16만명이었다. 이순신의 전라좌수영에 일본군의 침략이 알려진 때는 원균(元均)의 파발이 도착한 5월 26일(음력 4월 16일) 밤 10시였다. 이순신은 그 즉시 조정에 장계를 올렸고 아울러 경상, 전라, 충청도에도 왜의 침략을 알리는 파발을 보냈다. 그 뒤 이순신은 휘하의 병력 700여명을 비상 소집하여 방비를 갖추도록 하였다. 이 과정에서 이순신은 도주를 시도한 군졸 황옥현(黄玉玄)을 참수했다. 전열을 정비한 전라좌수영 소속 함대는 6월 8일(음력 4월 29일)까지 수영 앞바다에 총집결하도록 명령이 내려진 상태였다. 그러나 일본군 함대는 이미 전라좌도 앞바다에 도달하고 있었다. 다음날 9일(음력 4월 30일)에 이순신은 전라우도 수군이 도착하면 전투를 벌이겠다는 장계를 조정에 올렸다.
일본군이 부산포에 상륙, 파죽지세로 북진해오자 조정은 보름 만에 한성을 버리고 개성으로 피난했으며, 이어 평양을 거쳐 의주까지 퇴각했다. 선조는 1593년(선조 26) 9월 21일에 한성을 탈환했다는 소식을 듣고서 몇번을 주저하다가 1593년 10월 1일에 도성으로 돌아왔다.

옥포 해전
옥포해전은 이순신의 첫 승전을 알리게 된 해전이다. 6월 16일(음력 5월 7일) 정오 옥포항에서 정박하여 옥포에 침략했던 일본군을 공격하여 모두 26척을 침몰시켰으며, 잡혀있던 포로들을 구해내었다. 같은 날 오후에는 웅천현의 합포 앞바다에서 대선 4척, 소선 1척을 만나 이 또한 격파하였다. 전투는 17일(음력 5월 8일)에도 계속되었으며, 적진포에서 일본군이 보유한 군선 13척을 침몰시켰으나, 전세가 불리하여 육지로 도망간 적들을 쫓지는 못하였다. 이때 조선 조정은 이미 한양에서 파천하여 평안도로 후퇴하고 있었다. 27일(음력 5월 18일)에는 도원수 김명원(金命元)이 임진강 방어에 실패하여 일본군이 황해도까지 진격하는 것을 허용하고 말았다.

사천 해전
전라우수영군의 합류가 늦어지자, 7월 8일(음력 5월 29일)에 이순신은 뱃머리를 돌려 노량으로 향하였다. 그곳에서 원균의 경상우수영군을 만났다. 이날 사천 선창에 있던 일본군을 공격하여 총 적선 13척을 쳐부수었다. 이것이 바로 사천 해전이다. 이 전투에서 이순신은 왼쪽 어깨 위에 관통상을 입었다. 이 해전은 두번째 출동하여 벌어진 첫 번째 전투였고, 또한 거북선이 출전한 첫 번째 전투다.
이순신 함대는 7월 10일(음력 6월 2일)에도 전투를 벌여 승리하였는데, 일본군이 보유하던 화포에 비하여 성능이 우수한 지자총통 등의 화력이 승리의 원인이었다. 이순신의 함대는 계속하여 적을 추격하여 개도로 협공하였으며, 7월 12일(음력 6월 4일)에는 전라우수사와 합류하는 데 성공하였다. 13일(음력 6월 5일) 적 함대를 만나 큰 배 한 척과 중간 크기의 배 0척 작은 크기의 배 100척을 공격하였다. 16일(음력 6월 8일)까지 수색과 공격은 계속되었다.

한산도 대첩
한산도대첩은 임진왜란의 3대 대첩 중 하나로, 1592년(선조 25) 8월 14일(음력 7월 8일) 한산도 앞바다에서 이순신 휘하의 조선 수군이 일본군을 크게 무찌른 해전이다. 이 전투에서 육전에서 사용되던 포위 섬멸 전술 형태인 학익진을 처음으로 펼쳤다.
이순신의 함대는 이억기의 함대와 함께 8월 12일(음력 7월 6일)에 출발하여 당일 노량에 이르렀고, 이곳에서 경상우수사 원균과 합류하였다. 이 때 적선이 출몰하였다는 첩보를 얻어 8월 14일(음력 7월 8일) 큰배 36척, 중간배 24척, 작은배 13척을 만나 전투가 벌어졌다. 조선군 연합함대는 거짓으로 후퇴하는 척하여 적들을 큰 바다로 끌어 낸 다음, 모든 군선들이 일제히 학익진 진형을 갖춰 지자총통, 현자총통, 승자총통을 발포하여 적함선을 궤멸시키는 데 성공하였다. 포격으로 적함을 깨뜨린 뒤 적함의 갑판에서 백병전을 벌여 일본군을 격퇴하였으며, 여러 명의 포로들을 구해내었다. 이날 일본군은 큰 배 한 척, 중간 배 일곱 척, 작은 배 여섯 척만이 후방에 있어 도망을 칠 수 있었다.
8월 15일(음력 7월 9일) 안골포에 적선 40여 척이 정박해 있다는 보고를 받아 8월 16일(음력 7월 10일) 학익진을 펼친채 진격하여 왜선 59척을 침몰시켰다. 한편, 음력 7월 말에 이르러서야 육전에서도 홍의장군 곽재우(郭再祐)가 승리하였으며, 홍계남(洪季男)이 안성에서 승리하였다.

부산 해전
음력 8월 말 이순신의 함대는 전열을 정비하고 부산으로 출정하였다. 당포에서 경상우수사와 합류하였으며, 29일 적들의 동태에 대한 보고를 입수하여 그날부터 전투가 시작되었다. 음력 9월 1일 아침, 화준구미에서 일본군의 큰 배 5척, 다대포 앞바다에서 큰 배 8척, 서평포 앞바다에서 큰 배 9척, 절영도에서 큰 배 2척을 만나 쳐부수었다. 부산 앞바다에 이르러 적의 소굴에 있는 400여 척의 배 중 적선 100여 척을 쳐부수었으며, 2일까지 전투를 벌였다. 이때 배들을 모두 부수면 상륙한 일본군이 몰려 도망갈 방법이 없어지므로 후일 수륙에서 함께 공격하기 위해 함대를 물렸다.
이렇듯, 네 차례의 큰 싸움을 통해 일본군은 수로를 통하여 서해에 대한 해상권을 장악하여 보급로로 사용하려던 계획을 포기할 수 밖에 없었으며, 곡창인 전라도의 침략 또한 포기할 수 밖에 없었다. 이를 계기로 승승장구하던 일본군의 진격은 기세가 꺾이게 되었다. 그러나 네번의 전투를 거치는 중, 이순신이 아끼던 휘하장수 정운이 전사했다.

원균과의 불화
1592년 음력 6월 원균이 이순신과 연명으로 장계를 올리려 하였으나, 이순신이 먼저 단독으로 장계를 올렸다. 이로부터 각각 장계를 올려 조정에 싸움의 결과를 보고하였으며, 이 때문에 두 장군 사이에 골이 깊어지기 시작했다. 이순신은 자신의 일기 난중일기에서 원균의 성품과 인격에 문제가 많으며, 일의 처리에서도 불만인 점을 자주 기록하였다. 1593년 이순신이 삼도수군통제사가 되자 이순신의 명령을 받게 된 원균은 이에 반발하고 명령을 어기는 등 문제를 일으켜 두 사람의 틈이 더욱 더 벌어졌다. 이순신은 조정에 원균과의 불화에 스스로 책임을 지고 자신을 파직시켜 달라고 청하자, 조정에서는 원균을 충청도 병마절도사로 옮겨 제수하였다.
이후 원균은 이순신에 대해 유언비어를 퍼뜨렸으며, 이원익(李元翼)이 체찰사로서 증거를 찾아내려 했으나, 오히려 이순신이 반듯하고 충성심이 강하다는 사실만 확인했다고 한다.
원균과의 대립은 각기 정파적인 입장과 맞물려서 갈등이 심화되었으며, 선조실록과 선조수정실록 조차도 이러한 두 인물에 대한 입장차이가 심하다. 이에 대한 논의는 당시 뿐만 아니라, 임진왜란이 끝나고 논공행상을 하는 자리에서도 진위 및 당부에 대한 논란이 있었다.
미국과 영국 해군 교과서를 쓴 책인 '해전의 모든 것'(휴먼 앤 북스 펴냄)에서 이순신을 전설적인 명장 제독으로 추앙하는 반면, 원균은 조선 수군을 산채로 매장한 최악의 제독으로 평가한다.

웅포 해전
이순신 함대는 1593년 3월 12일(음력 2월 10일) 웅천현 웅포로 진격하였다. 그러나 이전의 경험에 비추어 보아 정면승부로는 승산이 없다고 판단한 일본군은 조선 수군을 왜성 깊숙히 유인하여 격파하려는 유인책을 썼다. 조선 수군은 이에 유의하며 화포등을 이용한 공격을 하였으나, 싸움은 지루한 공방전으로 전개되었다. 이후 일본군은 각지에 왜성을 쌓아 방비를 하며 왜성을 전략적 거점으로 삼아 조선 수군의 부산성 방면으로의 진출을 막음으로써 보급선을 유지하려는 전략을 구사하게 되었다. 웅천에서의 일본군을 소탕하기 위한 전투는 음력 3월까지 계속되었다.
이때 전라도의 수군은 정병 상하번 외에 보인까지 총동원, 4만여 명(충무공 장계)을 웅포 해전과 전라도 해안선 방어에 투입하였다.

삼도수군통제사
음력 6월 이순신은 한산도로 진을 옮겨 전열을 정비하였다. 음력 7월부터는 거제도와 진해(鎭海), 가덕도(加德島) 등지에서 일본군과 대치하는 상황이 계속되었다. 조선 3도 수군은 견내량에 방어선을 설정하였다. 한편, 일본군은 거제도의 영등포와 제포 사이를 방어선으로 삼고 있었다. 음력 8월 1일, 조선 조정은 이순신을 삼도수군통제사에 제수하고 본직은 그대로 겸직하도록 하였다. 이순신은 한산도에서 백성을 모아 소금을 굽고 곡식을 비축하여 든든한 진을 구축하기 시작했다. 한편 김성일 등은 제2차 진주성 전투에서 성은 함락 되었으나, 결과적으로 진주를 지켜 전라도 호남 지방을 방어하는 데 성공하였으며, 이후 이 지역을 통해 조선의 군수 물자와 전쟁 수행 능력이 보장되었다.

두 번째 백의종군
초기 전세가 교착화하고 강화 회담이 별다른 진척을 보이지 않고 대치 상태가 자꾸 길어졌다. 이순신과 원균 사이의 불화가 문제가 되었다. 두 차례의 대첩 이후 이순신이 그 공으로 조선 수군의 총지휘관인 삼도수군통제사가 되었지만, 원균은 자기가 나이도 많고 선배라는 점을 내세워 불만을 가진 것으로 보인다.
교착화한 전세에서 초기의 승전보 이후 별다른 승리가 없자 선조를 비롯한 조선 조정에서는 이순신의 전략을 불신하기 시작했으며 이순신에게 왜군에 대한 적극적인 공격을 강요하게 되었다. 당시 일본군은 남해안 일대에 총집결하여 왜성을 쌓는 등 수비를 강화하였으며 강화 회담의 진행 과정을 지켜보고 있었다. 한편 명나라는 전면적 대결보다는 강화 회담에 기대하고 있었으며, 조선은 자체의 군사력으로 일본군과 육전에서 대등한 전투를 수행할 능력이 부족했다. 그러나 조정의 요청과는 달리 이순신은 일본군의 유인작전에 걸려들 위험이 있다는 이유에서 견내량 전선을 유지하고 공격에 신중하게 임하고자 하였다. 이에 조정에서는 이순신이 지나치게 소극적이라는 비난이 일었다.

결국 정유년인 1597년 4월 11일(음력 2월 25일)에 통제사직에서 해임되어 원균에게 직책을 인계하고 한성으로 압송되어 4월 19일(음력 3월 4일)에 투옥되었다. 그때 우의정 정탁(鄭琢)의 상소로 5월 16일(음력 4월 1일)에 사형을 모면하였으며 이순신은 도원수 권율(權慄) 밑에서 백의종군하라는 명령을 받았다.
당시 권율은 남쪽으로 이동하고 있었는데, 이순신은 권율의 본진을 찾아가는 길에 가족을 만나려고 아산 본가에 잠시 머물렀다. 이순신이 한산도에 있는 동안 그의 가족은 순천 고음(舊 여천시)에 거주하고 있었는데, 아들의 석방 소식을 들은 그의 어머니가 아들을 만나기 위해 배를 타고 먼 길을 올라오고 있었다. 그러나 그의 어머니는 5월 26일(음력 4월 11일) 배 위에서 별세하고 만다. 그러나 이순신은 모친의 임종을 볼 수 없었다. (어머니의 임종소식은 4월 13일에서야 종 순화를 통해 알게 된다.) 이렇게 어머니를 잃은 이순신은 슬픔으로 몸과 마음이 모두 피폐해졌다.

칠천량 해전의 패배와 복직
1597년 8월 28일(음력 7월 16일)에 삼도수군통제사에 오른 원균이 이끄는 조선 함대가 칠천량 해전에서 일본군의 기습을 받아 춘원포로 후퇴, 수군들은 상륙하여 도주하고 판옥선 대부분이 불타거나 왜군에게 노획당해 오사카로 끌려간다. 이를 수습하기 위하여 조선 조정에서는 경림군(慶林君) 김명원(金命元), 병조 판서 이항복(李恒福)의 건의로 이순신을 다시 삼도수군통제사로 임명하였다. 하지만 이순신이 다시 조선 수군을 모아 정비했을 때 함선은 12척밖에 남아 있지 않았다. 조선 정부에서는 이 병력으로 적을 대항키 어렵다 하여 수군을 폐지하라는 명령을 내렸으나, 이순신은 아직도 12척의 배가 남아 있으며 내가 죽지 않는 한 적이 감히 우리의 수군을 업신여기지 못할 것이라는 비장한 결의를 표하였다고 한다. 그 뒤 전열을 재정비하기 위해 10월 9일(음력 8월 29일)에 진도 벽파진으로 진을 옮겼다.

임진왜란 종전과 전사
명량 해전
1597년 10월 26일(음력 9월 16일), 일본군 수백 척의 이동 정보를 접한 이순신은, 명량 해협에서 대적하기 위해 13척의 전선을 이끌고 출전했다. 명량 해협은 ‘울돌목’이라고도 불리었는데, 폭이 294m 밖에 되지못하여 바다 표층의 유속 6.5m/s정도로 굉장히 빠르고, 밀물과 썰물 때에는 급류로 변하는 곳이었다. 이순신은 울돌목의 조류가 싸움에 불리함을 깨닫고 새로 합류한 1척을 추가한 13척의 전선으로 우수영(右水營) 앞바다인 임하도(林下島)로 진을 옮겨 일본 함대를 그곳으로 유인해 최소 130척 이상의 전선을 격파하였다. 난중일기와 선조실록에는 약 30여 척을 격침했다고 기록하였으나 이것은 통제사 이순신이 이끄는 공격부대의 전과일 뿐 임하도의 좁은 목을 막고 있던 수비 부대의 전과나 피해 사항은 기록하지 않은 것이다. 그러나 난중잡록과 선묘중흥지을 통해서 조선 수군은 중.후반부터 화전(火戰)을 했음을 알 수 있다. 통제사가 적의 선봉대중 30여척을 격파하였지만 해남 명량대첩비에는 500척으로 기록되어 있어서 실제 격파된 왜선은 30여척보다 많을것으로 파악된다.

""破賊船五百艘 斬其將馬多時"" ""적군의 배를 쳐부순것이 오백척이며 그 장수 마다시를 베었다""<해남 명량대첩비>

이를 명량 해전이라고 하며 이 해전의 승리로 조선 수군은 나라를 위기에 빠뜨렸던 정유재란의 전세를 역전시켰다. 일본은 곤궁에 빠져 명나라 장군에게 뇌물을 보내어 화의를 꾀하였으나 이순신은 이를 반대하고, 이듬해 1598년 음력 8월 18일 도요토미 히데요시(豐臣秀吉)가 병사하고, 사망 직전 철군하라는 유언을 남기며 일본군이 철수하게 된다.

전사
1598년 음력 11월 18일에 조선 수군 70여 척, 명나라 수군 400척이 노량으로 진군했다. 군사는 1만 6천명이었다. 이순신은 명나라 부총병 진린(陳璘)과 함께 1598년 음력 11월 19일 새벽부터 노량해협에 모여 있는 일본군을 공격하였고, 일본으로 건너갈 준비를 하고 있던 왜군 선단 500여 척 가운데 200여 척을 격파, 150여 척을 파손시켰다. 전투는 정오까지 이어졌고, 관음포로 달아나는 왜군을 추적하던 이순신은 날아온 탄환에 맞아 전사하였다. 죽기 전에 그는 ""지금은 싸움이 급하다. 나의 죽음을 알리지 말라.""는 말을 남겼다고 한다. 향년 54세. 낙안군수 방덕룡(方德龍), 가리포첨사 이영남(李英男)과 명의 장수 등자룡(鄧子龍)도 함께 전사했다.
노량해전을 끝으로 7년의 임진왜란은 끝나게 되었다. 선조실록의 사관은 당시 사람들이 모두 죽은 이순신이 산 왜놈들을 격파하였다고 말했다고 한다.

사후 관직
전사한 직후 1598년 12월에 정1품 우의정에 증직되었다. 1604년 6월에 선조는 그를 권율, 원균과 함께 선무(宣武) 1등 공신 및 덕풍부원군(德豐府院君)으로 추봉하고 그해 7월에 좌의정을 가증했다. 1643년 3월에 인조는 그에게 '충무(忠武)' 시호를 내려 충무공(忠武公)이 되었다. 1659년 효종 때 남해에 그를 기려 충무공 이순신의 비(碑)를 세웠다. 1688년(숙종 14년)에는 해남 명량대첩비가 건립되었고 1705년 현충사가 건립되었으며, 1793년 7월에 정조는 정1품 의정부 영의정을 가증했다.
이순신의 최종 직함은 아래와 같다.

가계
이순신의 조부 품앙공(楓巖公) 이백록(李百綠)은 중종 14년(1519년) 학행이 높고 문장 기절을 지녀 기묘사적에 들어갔다. 중종 17년(1522년) 임오 식년시(式年試) 생원 3등으로 생원이 되었으며 같은해 사마 행검으로 생원 선교랑 참봉에 천제되었으나 기묘사화의 영향으로 나아가지 않았다. 이후 성균관 생원을 거쳤으나 문과에 급제는 하지 못하였고 선교랑 평시서봉사를 지냈다. 중종 35년(1540) 품행의 문제로 탄핵되고 경기도 용인시 수지읍 고기리에서 여생을 보내다 중종 39년(1544) 중종의 국상에 결례를 범한 오해(삼남 이귀(李貴)의 혼사시 주육설판)로 의금부에서 곤장으로 복초(服招) 당한 후 녹안되었으며 회복하지 못하고 별세한 것으로 추정된다.
흔히들 이순신의 조부 품앙공(楓巖公) 이백록(李百綠)이 중종 14년(1519년) 조광조(趙光祖)가 기묘사화(己卯士禍)로 사약을 받아 죽고 주위 인물들도 참형을 당한 뒤 벼슬을 내놓고 조광조의 묘소가 있는 용인 심곡리에서 멀지 않은 고기리에서 은거를 하다가 사망했으며, 이로 인해 아들(즉 이순신의 아버지) 정(貞)은 벼슬을 단념한 채 43세쯤 외가이자 처가에 가까운 충청도 아산 음봉(훗날 상주 방씨(온양 방씨)와 혼인한 이순신이 정착한 곳이기도 한 현충사 자리에서 멀지 않은 곳)으로 이사하였다고 덕수 이씨 집안의 구전으로 전해진다 알려져 있지만 사실과 다르다.
KBS드라마 불멸의 이순신에서 역적 및 가난한 시절을 보내는 줄거리는 허구다. 어머니인 초계 변씨(草溪卞氏)가 1588년 3월 12일 작성한 별급문기를 참고하면 전국에 노비 총 21명(노 12명, 비 9명)과 토지(영광, 나주, 고흥, 영변, 은율 등)를 소유하고 있었다. 슬하에 형제들에게 생전 재산증여가 이루어 졌는데 장남 이희신(李羲臣)과 이우신(李禹臣)에게 명종 19년(1564), 차남 이요신(李堯臣)이 생원이 되었던 선조 6년(1573), 삼남 이순신(李舜臣)이 무과에 급제하였던 선조 9년(1576)이다. 또한 선조 22년에 아내 상주 방씨(온양 방씨)가 4형제에게 준 분재기 기록도 남아있다. 현충사 경내에 있는 고택 역시 이순신이 자신의 할아버지 백록으로부터 받은 것이라고 알려졌다.
이순신의 두 형인 이희신과 이요신은 임진왜란 발발 전 모두 별세하였다. 기록 상 임진왜란에 함께하여 공을 세운 조카들은 이분, 이완, 이봉, 이해이다. 특히 이완은 노량해전에서 숙부인 이순신이 《전방급 신물언아사》를 남기고 죽자 이를 알리지 않고 독전한 인물로 유명하며 이요신의 두 아들인 이봉과 이해는 전쟁이 끝난 후 선무원종공신 2등에 녹훈(1605)되고 무반 생활을 지속한 것으로 보아 임진왜란과 정유재란에서 공이 적지 않은 것으로 사료된다.

충무공 가계
이순신은 한성을 떠나 외가와 처가(온양 방씨)가 있는 충청도 아산으로 이주했다. 조선 중기까지도 남귀녀가혼(男歸女家婚)의 영향으로 남자가 결혼한 뒤 처가에서 상당 기간 거주하는 풍습은 부인과 처가의 위상을 높였다.
이순신의 처가는 상주 방씨(온양 방씨)이다. 장인은 보성군수를 역임한 방진이다. 방진의 할아버지는 평창군수를 지낸 방홍(方弘)이고, 아버지는 영동현감을 지낸 방중규(方中規)이다. 당시 병조판서였던 이준경(1499년~1572년)이 중매를 섰다. 1565년(명종 20) 이순신은 21세의 나이에 방씨에게 청혼하고 결혼하였다. 이순신은 장인의 격려와 경제적 후원으로 무과 시험을 준비하게 되며, 그로부터 활쏘기와 말타기 등을 배우면서 병학을 익혀 11년만인 1576년 2월에 치러진 무과 시험에서 병과로 급제했다. 《충무공이순신전서》의 ‘방부인전’에 방진의 활솜씨에 대한 기록이 있다. 방씨 부인은 슬기롭기로 유명하였고, 친정 집에 들어온 도둑들을 지혜를 이용해 물리치기도 했다. 이순신의 무술 연습을 위해 자신의 패물로 말을 사게 할 만큼 내조도 잘했다. 임진왜란 중에 이순신은 아들들을 통해 충청도 아산 본가에 있던 방씨 소식을 듣기는 했지만 직접 다녀오지는 못했다. 그러나 방씨가 병에 걸려 위독하다는 소식을 듣고는 잠을 설치며 걱정했을 뿐더러 점까지 치며 방씨 부인을 염려하는 내용이 일기에 적혀 있다. 1598년 (선조 31) 노량해전에서 전사한 이순신에게 우의정이 증직된 후 그 처인 방씨를 정경부인으로 봉하면서 내린 이순신처 방씨 고신교지(李舜臣妻方氏告身教旨)는 보물 제1564-8호이다. 정경부인은 경국대전의 규정에 따라 정·종 1품 문무관의 처에게 내리는 명호(名號)로 외명부 부인으로서는 최상급의 품계이다.
이순신은 방씨와의 사이에서 이회(1567년 출생), 이예(1571년 출생), 이면(1577년 출생)의 세 아들과 딸 하나를 두었으며 해주오씨와의 사이에 이훈(1574년 출생), 이신(출생년도 미상)의 두 아들과 두 딸을 두었다. 이순신은 임진왜란과 정유재란에 가문의 절손 위험이 있음에도 위기에 빠진 조선을 구하기 위하여 아들과 조카들을 의병 신분으로 참전시켜 각종 전투에 함께 하였다. 특히 이순신이 전사한 노량해전의 경우 《조선왕조실록》, 《징비록》의 기록을 참고하면 명량해전 직후 전사한 이면(李葂)을 제외하고 대장선에 장자인 이회(李薈), 차남 이예(李䓲), 조카 이완(李莞)이 승선하여 전투에 임하였음을 알 수 있다.
현존하는 이순신의 후손은 서자인 이훈(李薰)의 손을 제외하고 모두 장자인 이회(李薈)의 직계 후손이다.

인물
이순신과 한 동네에서 살았던 벗이기도 한 류성룡은 《징비록》에서 어린 시절의 이순신에 대해, 다른 아이들과 모여 놀 때면 나무를 깎아 활과 화살을 만들어 동리에서 전쟁놀이를 하곤 했으며, 그의 성격을 거슬러 마음에 들지 않는 사람의 눈을 쏘려고 하였으므로 어른들도 그를 꺼려 감히 군문(軍門) 앞을 지나려고 하지 않았다고 적고 있다.
이순신은 완벽주의자로 뭐든지 철저함을 추구했다. 한산도 대첩 하루 전 군무이탈을 감행한 부하 수졸 황옥현을 붙잡자마자 바로 참수하여 효수해 군기를 보존한 반면 부하들에게는 죽음을 각오하고 싸우면 무조건 이긴다, 하지만 도망치려 하면 죽는다(必死則生必生則死)는 것을 강조하여 부하들에게 자신감을 심어주기 위해 많은 노력을 기울였으며 부하들이 잘하면 포상에 아낌이 없었다. 군영 순시 중에 자신이 담당하던 업무에 소홀하였던 일선 지휘관은 곤장을 쳤다는 기록이 몇번 있다.  또한 자신의 군공보다는 아군의 승리에 더 관심이 깊었으며 이 때문에 평소에 친하게 지내던 권율에게 자신이 사용하는 무기의 일부를 제공했으며 권율은 이순신에게 제공받은 이 무기들로 행주대첩을 이룩하게 되었다.
이순신의 용모에 대해서는 이순신 생전에 그려진 초상화가 없고 그의 얼굴을 묘사한 기록만이 남아 있을 뿐이다. 100원 주화에 새겨진 이순신 제독의 복식이나 이순신 제독의 초상화 중 갑옷이나 전립이 아닌 관복 차림의 이순신 초상화는 영의정의 예우를 갖춰 그려졌고 실제로 이순신이 살아생전 그 복장을 입은 적은 없다.
녹둔도 사건으로 알 수 있듯 이순신은 무예가 매우 뛰어났다. 고작 수십명의 보병으로 1천 기에 달하는 여진족 기병을 상대로 이경록과 단 둘이 지휘해서 이겼는데 휘하 병력이 100명 이하인 상황이라면 개인 무예가 반드시 필요한 상황이다. 이런 상황에서 승리를 거둔 이순신은 무예가 매우 뛰어나다는 것을 알 수 있다.

평가
사후부터 대한민국 수립 이후에 걸쳐 이순신은 신분과 시대를 막론하고 존경과 숭모의 대상이 되었다. 각 여론조사에서 존경하는 인물이다.

국내 이순신의 평가
선조

《졸서후사제문(卒逝後賜祭文)》에서도 똑같이 그 잘못을 사죄하는 듯한 말을 남기며 ""인생 한 세상에 한번 죽음 못 면하네. 죽을 데서 죽은 이로 그대 같은 이 드물도다.""라고 추켜세웠다.
류성룡

《징비록》에서 류성룡은 ""이순신은 백 번 싸운 장군으로서 한 손으로 친히 무너지는 하늘을 붙든 사람이었다. 그리고 이순신은 재질을 가지고도 운수가 없어 백 가지 재능을 한 가지도 풀어 보지 못한 사람이었다.""고 평하였다.
효종

효종이 경연 자리에서, ""아침에 이순신(李舜臣)의 비문(碑文)을 보았는데, 죽을 힘을 다하여 싸우다가 순절(殉節)한 일에 이르러서는 눈물이 줄줄 흘러내리는 것을 깨닫지 못하였다. 이는 하늘이 우리 나라를 중흥시키기 위하여 이런 훌륭한 장수를 탄생시킨 것이다. 이순신의 재능은 악비(岳飛)와 같은데, 더욱 작은 병력으로 큰 병력을 공격하는 데 능하였다.""고 하였다.
정조

정조가 신하들에게 말하기를, ""이순신(李舜臣)은 무인(武人)이지만 또한 '선정(先正)'으로 일컬었고 보면 선정을 꼭 유현에게만 사용하지 않는다는 것이 분명하다."" 하였다.
김육

효종 임금에게, ""조정에서 현재 절의를 숭상하고 장려하는 은전을 시행하고 있습니다만, 우리 나라에서 충신으로 드러나 칭송할 만한 이는 고 통제사 이순신(李舜臣)만한 이가 없는데도, 묘소에 아직까지 조그만 표석(表石)조차도 없으니, 이는 자손들이 미약한 소치입니다.""고 아뢰었다.
오윤겸

제문에서 그는 이순신의 죽음을 두고 ""황천에서 다시 일으켜올 수 없음을 생각하고 백 명을 대신 바치고도 몰려올 수 없음을 안타까워한다.""고 평하였다.
홍석주

이순신이 전사한 노량 바닷가에서 멀지 않은 관음포의 이충무공전몰유허(李忠武公戰歿遺墟)에서 홍석주는 이순신을 중국의 제갈량에 빗대어 칭송하고, 제갈량이 병사한 뒤에는 촉한이 위태롭게 된 것과는 달리 이순신은 오히려 그가 남긴 공적 덕분에 지금(홍석주가 살아 있었던 시대)에 이르기까지 사직(社稷)이 남아 있을 수 있다며 이순신의 공적을 치켜세우고 있다.
근현대에 이르러서도 ""충무공은 거의 완전무결한 인물이었다. 그러기에 성자라 하고 영웅이라 일컫는 것이다.""(천관우) 등 이순신에 대한 평가는 아주 높았다.

국외 이순신의 평가
다음은 이순신에 대한 국외의 인물들이 내린 평가다.
참고로 일본어 위키백과 이순신 문서에 의하면 도고 헤이하치로의 발언은 일본에 직접적인 사료가 남아있지 않으며 일제 강점기 조선의 실업가 이영개가 도고 헤이하치로에게 이런 얘기를 들었다고 하면서 퍼트린 얘기라고 기술되어 있다.

충청도 충주에서 출생하여 지난날 한때 평안도 개천에서 잠시 유아기를 보낸 적이 있는 그는 1602년 충청도 충주 향리에 귀향하여 그 후 충청도 충주에서 줄곧 자랐고 1612년(19세 시절) 진사시에 합격 후 1618년(25세 시절) 2살 아래의 친아우 임사업(林嗣業)과 함께 때 무과에 급제하였으며, 1624년(인조 1) 이괄의 난 때에는 반란군을 토벌하여 1등 공신에 책록되었다. 1633년 청북 방어사 겸 영변부사에 등용되어 북방 경비를 튼튼히 하기 위해 의주에 있는 백마 산성을 다시 쌓았다. 당시 누르하치가 만주 대륙을 통일하여 나라 이름을 후금이라 칭하고 명나라와 조선에 싸움을 자주 걸어왔다. 후금의 소규모 부대가 국경을 넘어오자 이를 여러 번 격퇴하여 되돌려보냈다. 시호가 충민(忠愍)이다.
조선 조정 내 친명 인사의 한 사람으로, 명나라는 임진왜란 때 조선을 도와 주었으며, 임경업은 명나라를 위하여 오랑캐를 무찌르는 것으로 보답하여, 명나라와 가까운 사이가 되었다.

생애
병자호란 때까지
임경업의 아버지 임황은 당상관인 절충장군에까지 올랐으나, 임진왜란 이후 여러 번의 귀양살이 끝에 벼슬에서 물러났다. 임경업은 어릴 적부터 기상이 활달하고 용감하여 전쟁놀이를 좋아하였다. 그가 6세 때 골목에서 진을 치고 전쟁놀이를 하고 있는데, 어른들이 그의 진영을 밟고 지나가려고 하자, 임경업은 ""안됩니다. 이 곳은 대장군이 지휘하는 진영이므로 아무도 지나갈 수 없습니다.""라고 눈을 부릅뜨고 말하여 어른들을 놀라게 하였다고 한다. 또한 학문도 비상하여 글재주가 있었다.
어려서부터 용맹하여 말을 잘 타고 활을 잘 쏘아 1618년(광해군 10) 무과에 급제하였고, 1620년 소농보권관, 1622년 중추부첨지사를 거쳐 1624년(인조 2) 〈이괄의 난〉이 일어나자 관군에 응모 출전하여 정충신 휘하에서 머무르다가 안현(鞍峴) 싸움에서 이괄의 군대를 맞아 공을 세워 진무원종공신 1등에 올랐다.
그 후 우림위장·방답진첨절제사 등을 지내고, 1627년 정묘호란 때 좌영장으로 강화에 갔으나 이미 화의가 성립된 후였다. 1630년 평양중군으로 검산성(劒山城)과 용골성(龍骨城)을 수축하는 한편 가도(島)에 주둔한 명나라 도독 유흥치(劉興治)의 군사를 감시, 그 준동을 막았다. 1633년 청북방어사 겸 영변부사로 백마산성과 의주성을 수축했으며, 명나라에 반란을 일으킨 공유덕(孔有德) 등의 무리를 토벌하여 명나라로부터 벼슬을 받기도 하였다.
1634년 의주부윤으로 청북방어사를 겸임할 때 포로를 석방했다는 모함을 받고 파직되었다가 1636년 무혐의로 복직되었다.

대청 투쟁
1636년(인조 14년) 병자호란이 일어나자 의주부윤(義州府尹)으로서 백마산성에서 청나라 군대의 진로를 차단하고 원병을 청했으나, 김자점의 방해로 결국 남한산성까지 포위되었다. 1636년 병자호란 발발 직후 다시 여진족이 침입했다. 이때 그는 백마 산성에서 후금 군사들의 기세를 꺾어 놓았으나 적은 백마 산성을 피하여 서울로 공격해 들어왔기 때문에 조선은 제대로 싸움도 못해 보고 후금에 무릎을 꿇었다. 이 소식을 들은 임경업은 땅을 치며 통곡하였다.
그러나 청나라가 조선에 원병을 청하자, 자신의 뜻과는 달리 명나라와 싸움을 해야 했다. 그리하여 그는 명나라에게 사람을 보내 자신의 본심이 아님을 알리고, 이쪽의 전략을 알려주어 피해가 적도록 했다.(1637년 가도 정벌) 또 의주에 물자가 불안정하자 밀무역을 했는데 이를 계기로 인조는 임경업을 파직시킨다
1640년 안주목사 때 청나라의 명령으로 주사상장으로 금주위에 주둔 중인 명군을 공격하기 위해 출병한다. 어쩔 수 없이 출병하긴 하였으나, 다시 명군과 내통하여 의도적으로 선봉장을 피하고, 청나라 장수 심세괴를 선봉장에 나서게 하고 그 사실을 명군에 알려 섬세괴가 전사하도록 하기도 했다. 그러나 여러 차례 이런 일이 일어나던 중, 가도 주둔 명군의 지휘관인 도독 홍승주가 청나라에 투항하면서 이러한 사실이 알려져 체포되었다. 임경업은 청으로 압송되기 전 황해도 금교역(金郊驛)에서 탈출했고, 이에 청 태종은 임경업을 빌미로 조선 내 반청세력에 대한 소탕령을 내렸다. 조선에 더 머무르기 힘들게 된 임경업은 1643년 명나라로 망명하게 된다.
그러나 그는 청나라에 발각되어 붙잡히게 되자 탈출하여 끝끝내 승려 행세로 변복을 하고 명나라로 건너간다.
1643년 명나라로 망명하여 명나라의 총병이 되어 청나라를 공격하였다. 명나라 등주 도독 황룡을 통해 숭정제에게 부총병의 직위를 하사받고 청나라 정벌을 준비하게 되었다. 그러나 정벌 준비 중 청군이 북경을 함락하고 도르곤이 산해관에 입성하자 황룡은 겁을 먹고 도망쳤고, 중군을 이끌던 마등홍이 대신 전군을 영솔하고 임경업과 함께 석성에 주둔하였다. 그러나 대세는 이미 기울어져 명나라 숭정제가 목매어 자결하였고, 천도한 남경마저 함락되어 정세가 바뀌자 마등홍 역시 청에 항복하였다. 임경업도 도망가려 하였으나 체포되어 북경으로 압송되었다. 청 태종은 임경업을 설득하여 자신의 부하로 삼으려고 했다고 한다. 그러나 임경업은 끝내 이를 거부하였다.

송환과 사형
그는 청나라의 포로가 되어 심양으로 호송되었다. 이때 국내에서 좌의정 심기원의 모반에 임경업이 연루되었다는 소문이 돌았다. 심기원이 자백을 했다는 것이다. 이 보고를 접한 1646년 인조는 임경업을 심문하기 위해 임경업의 환국을 요청했고, 순치제는 그를 내주었다.
조선에 돌아온 그는 친청파 인사인 김자점의 비판과 죄를 주어야 된다는 여론에 의해 죽었다.
1646년 6월 17일(인조 24년 6월 17일) 인조의 친국 과정에서 심기원과는 아무런 관련 사항이 없다는 사실이 점차 분명해지자 임경업을 시기한 김자점이 나라를 배신하고 남의 나라에 들어가 국법을 위반했다며, 형리들을 시켜 장살(杖殺)시켜 버렸다.

사후
사후 그를 죽음으로 몰고 간 김자점도 몰락하고, 북벌론을 주장하던 송시열, 윤휴 등이 집권하였으나 청나라의 비위를 거슬리는 것을 두려워하여 그의 신원, 복권 주장은 번번히 묵살되었다.
1697년(숙종 23) 복관(復官)되었으며, 충주 충렬사(忠烈祠), 선천의 충민사 등에 배향되었다. 1726년(영조 2년)에 호서지방 사람들이 충렬사(忠烈社)를 세웠고, 이듬해(영조 3년)에 조정에서 사액(賜額)을 내리고 관리를 보내어 제사를 지냈다. 1791년(정조 15년)에는 왕이 친히 글을 지어 비석에 새겨 전하게 하였으니 “어제달천충열사비”이다. 1978년 충렬사는 정부의 특별지원으로 성역화되었다.
그의 무용담을 소재로 한 구전 소설 임경업 전 등이 있다. 시호는 충민이다.

일화
임경업은 죽기 직전 “천하의 일이 아직도 끝나지 않았는데 나를 죽이는 것은 큰 일을 그르치는 것이 아니냐?”라고 외치며 한 많은 생을 마쳤으니 그의 나이 53세였다. 이 소식을 들은 왕은 “그대여, 나는 죽이려 하지 않았는데 어찌하여 갑자기 세상을 떠났느냐?”라고 탄식을 금치 못했다 한다.
임경업을 모함하여 때려죽인 김자점도 얼마 못가 역모를 꾸미려다가 발각되어 피살되었다.
임경업이 금교역에서 탈출한 이후 청나라에서는 그의 부인을 심양으로 끌고 가서 고문했다. 그러나, 임경업의 부인은 “우리 주인은 대명(大明)의 충신이요, 나는 그 충신의 아내이다. 오랑캐의 옥중에서 욕을 보며 남편의 충절을 욕보일 수가 있는가?”라고 하며 품에서 칼을 꺼내어 자결을 했다고 전해진다.

설화
임경업의 억울한 죽음에 대한 민중의 보상심리로 영웅의 죽음을 부정하고 민중의 역사인식이 반영하여 전설이나 설화 혹은 민담으로 영웅적인 모습과 신격화에 한 몫을 하고 있다. 민간에서는 임경업 장군신이 흔히 잡귀를 쫓아내고, 병을 낫게 하며, 무병장수와 안과태평을 가져다 준다고 믿으며 무당들의 수호신 역할을 하고 있다. 박수(남자무당)는 무신도 형태로 임경업 장군신을 모시며, 만신(여자무당)은 임경업 장군신의 상징으로 ‘고비전’이라 하여 종이를 오려 만든 것을 신당의 벽에 걸기도 한다.
임경업 설화는 전국적으로 전승되고 있는데, 조선 후기 병자호란 후 연평도를 지나던 임경업 장군이 '살'을 이용한 조기잡이 방법을 전수하였다는 전설이 전해진다.

생애
장보고의 계통과 출신에 대해서는 기록이 알려져 있지 않다. 김부식의 《삼국사기》에는 그의 본명을 궁복(弓福) 또는 궁파(弓巴)라고 적고 있다. 그의 이름은 활과 관련이 있는 것으로 해석되고 있다.
일찍부터 친구 정년과 함께 당나라의 서주(徐州)로 건너가 그곳에서 승마와 창술에 특출난 재주를 보이며 군인으로서 출사해 무령군중소장(武寧軍中小將)의 직책을 받게 되었다. 흥덕왕 3년(828년) 초에 신라로 돌아온 그는 왕에게 신라인들이 해적들에게 납치되어 노예로 팔리고 있는 참상을 전하며, 군사 거점을 세워 이를 금지시켜 줄 것을 청했다. 마침내 승인을 얻어 1만여 명의 군대를 확보한 그는 완도에 청해진을 세우고 대사(大使)가 되었다. 그의 활약으로 827년~835년 이후로 해상에서 신라 노예를 매매하는 일이 사라졌다고 《신당서》 및 《삼국사기》는 평가하고 있다.
장보고는 해적 토벌에 그치지 않고 서남해 해상권을 장악하여 당나라와 일본뿐만 아니라 발해와 탐라, 우산국, 참파, 스리위자야, 마타람 왕국, 크메르 제국, 라보 왕국, 팔라 제국, 라슈트라쿠타 제국, 프라티하라 제국, 아바스 칼리파국 등 여러 나라와의 무역으로 많은 이익을 취하였으며, 아울러 큰 세력을 이루었다. 신라인들이 많이 이주한 산둥성 문등현(文登縣) 적산촌(赤山村)에 신라인들이 법화원(法華院)을 건립하려 하자 그는 이를 적극 지원하였다. 또한 신라인 출신 노예들을 사들이거나 주인에게서 되돌려받아 신라 출신 노예들을 석방시켰으며, 이들은 신라 출신 이민자들이 건너간 산동 주변으로 옮겨가게 된다. 그의 적극적인 지원으로 법화원은 상주하는 승려가 30여 명 이상이 되었으며, 토지를 기부하여 연간 500석을 추수하는 장전(莊田)을 가지고 있었다. 이 지역 신라인의 정신적인 중심지로 성장했고, 법회를 열 때 200~400명까지 인파가 몰려들었다. 골품제와 같은 기존의 신분제에 구애됨이 없이 유능한 인재들을 널리 받아들였고, 또 자신의 진영에 환대하여 신분을 따지지 않고 실력에 따라 대우하여 그들의 능력을 적극 발휘할 수 있게 하였다. 이러한 빈민들을 규합하고, 새로운 활동 무대를 찾아 모여든 인재들을 포용하여, 8세기 이래 왕성하였던 신라인의 해상활동 능력을 적극 활용, 이것들을 묶어 조직화하였다.
838년부터 847년까지 당나라에 머무르며 구법행을 했던 일본의 승려 엔닌은 자신이 당에 체재하는 동안 장보고의 휘하에 있던 현지 신라인들로부터 도움을 받아 구법행을 완수할 수 있었고, 장보고에게 감사하는 내용의 편지를 보내기도 했다. 귀국한 뒤 엔닌은 히에이 산 엔랴쿠지에 자신이 체재했던 등주(登州)의 신라인 사찰 적산법화원을 본떠 적산대명신(赤山大明神, 도교의 신인 태산부군泰山府君)을 모시는 적산선원의 건립을 발원하기도 했다.
흥덕왕이 재위 11년만에 죽고, 신라에서 일어난 왕위 다툼에서 김제륭(희강왕)에게 패하고 피살된 김균정의 아들 김우징이 청해진으로 피신해 오자 장보고는 그를 숨겨주었다. 그러나 김제륭도 재위 3년만인 838년 김명이 일으킨 정변으로 피살되고 김명이 스스로 민애왕으로 즉위하자, 예전 김균정의 편에 섰다가 패하고 달아난 김양이 군사를 모아 청해진으로 찾아와서 김우징을 만나고 장보고에게 도움을 청했다. 이때 김우징은 장보고에게 “나를 도와준다면 내가 왕위에 오른 뒤 당신의 딸을 왕비로 삼겠다”는 약속을 했고, 이에 동의한 장보고는 친구 정년에게 청해진의 군사 5천을 내주어 김양과 함께 왕경으로 진격하게 했다. 장보고와 정년이 이끄는 청해진 군사는 무주와 대구를 거쳐 왕경에 입성, 왕경군을 격퇴한 뒤 민애왕을 죽이고 김우징(신무왕)을 추대한다. 이 공으로 감의군사(感義軍使)의 직책과 식읍 2,000호를 하사받았다. 신무왕이 죽고 문성왕이 즉위한 뒤에는 진해장군에 임명되었으며, 문성왕 2년(840년) 일본에 무역 사절을 파견하고 당에도 견당매물사(遣唐賣物使)를 보내는 등 삼각무역을 실시했다.
그러나 귀족과 신하들이 장보고가 신라 왕을 탐한다며 지속적으로 문성왕에게 경고했고, 결국 문성왕은 예전의 장보고의 부하였던 명을 받은 자객 염장을 보내 장보고를 살해했다. 《삼국사기》 신라본기는 장보고가 사망한 연대를 문성왕 8년(846년)이라고 기록하였으나 《속일본후기》는 조와(貞和) 7년(841년) 11월 중에 죽었다고 하였다. 그뿐만 아니라 동시대의 기록인 《입당구법순례행기》(入唐求法巡禮行記)는 회창(會昌) 5년(845년) 7월에 전 청해진 병마사가 국난을 당하여 중국에 망명하였다는 기록이 보이므로, 교차검증과 전후맥락의 측면에서 보다 설득력이 있다. 현재 대한민국 국사편찬위원회에서도 장보고의 사망 기년을 841년으로 보고 있다.
문성왕 13년(851년) 신라 조정은 청해진을 없애고 그곳 주민을 벽골군(碧骨郡)으로 옮겼다.

평가
장보고와 정년이 원래 지기였고, 당에서 무령군중소장이 된 사실을 소개한 《삼국사기》 장보고열전의 저본은 중국 당나라 두목(杜牧)이 지은 장보고전, 즉 《신당서》권220 신라전이다. 장보고가 먼저 신라로 돌아가 높은 관위(청해진대사)를 얻은 뒤, 반대로 관직에서 물러나 한미하게 지내던 정년이 장보고를 믿고 그를 찾아갔을 때에 정년을 예를 갖추어 환대한 것, 환영 연회를 벌이던 도중에 국왕이 살해당하고 수도가 혼란에 빠진 소식이 전해지자 장보고가 기꺼이 정년에게 군사 5천을 내어 주어 “자네가 아니면, 이 화란을 진압할 수 없다.”며 반란을 토벌하고 새로운 왕을 옹립하게 했으며, 이 공으로 장보고는 재상에 등용되고 정년이 청해진대사를 이어받은 사실 등을 적고 있다. 나아가 두목이 장보고와 정년의 교제를 안녹산의 난 때의 곽분양(郭汾陽, 곽자의) ㆍ 이임회(李臨淮, 이광필)의 교제에 빗대어 인의(仁義)의 사람이라 칭찬한 것을 전하면서, 《신당서》열전을 편찬한 송기(宋祁)의 평으로 국난의 시기에 의(義)를 품고 국가의 우환을 먼저 생각한 사람으로서 진(晉)의 기해(祁奚)와 당의 곽분양, 그리고 장보고를 거론하고 ""어찌 동쪽에는 뛰어난 인물이 없다고 할 수 있겠는가?""라고 칭하고 있다. 이를 다시 《삼국사기》에 기재한 김부식은 신라본기와의 기사와 서로 어긋나는 부분을 지적하는 한편으로 장보고에 대한 두목과 송기의 평가를 지지한다. 또한 김유신전의 말미에서도 김유신의 공적을 뛰어나다고 칭찬하면서도 고구려 을지문덕의 지략과 장보고의 무용을 함께 찬양하고 있다. 이러한 평가는 후대 조선조의 안정복에게까지 이어졌다.

적산다이묘진과 신라다이묘진
장보고가 활약했던 9세기 전반, 산동 반도의 항구도시였던 적산(赤山), 지금의 룽청시(荣成市)에는 장보고와 연계한 당시 많은 신라 상인이 거류하고 있었다. 그는 이곳에 적산법화원(赤山法華院)을 세웠는데, 이 무렵 당 조정의 명령으로 서둘러 귀국해야만 했지만, 당에 남아서 천태종을 배우기로 결의한 일본의 입당청익승(入唐請益僧) 엔닌을 위해, 그를 적산법화원에 머물도록 배려하고, 현지의 중국 관인들과 교섭해, 공험(公驗, 여행허가증)을 얻어내주기도 하는 등~ 엔닌의 9년 6개월에 걸친 구법행(行)을 물심 양면에 걸쳐서 지원했었다.

오늘날 일본 교토시 북쪽 히에이 산에 위치한 적산선원에 모셔져 있는 적산다이묘진(赤山大明神)은 엔닌의 제자가 엔닌의 뜻을 이어 신라인들이 섬기던 신을 모시기 위해 닌나 4년(888년)에 세운 것이다. 흔히 도교의 최고신인 태산부군으로 알려져 있는 이 신에 대해 일각에서는 이 신이 장보고를 모티브로 한 신이 아니냐는 주장이 제기되고 있다. 적산대명신과 함께 엔랴쿠사 경내에 신라다이묘진(新羅大明神)을 모신 신사도 존재하고 있는데, 현재 일본 시가 현 오쓰 시의 온조사(園城寺)에도 마찬가지로 이 신라다이묘진을 모신 신라선신당(新羅善神堂)이 남아 있다. 엔닌과 마찬가지로 당에 유학했다가 돌아오던 승려 엔친(圓珍)이 바다 위에서 풍랑을 만났을 때, ‘붉은 옷을 입고 흰 활을 들고 나타나’ 풍랑을 잠잠하게 가라앉혀 엔친을 무사히 귀국할 수 있도록 도와주고 그가 가지고 돌아오던 경법(經法)을 영원히 수호할 것을 맹세한 신이었다 하여 엔친이 가지고 온 경전과 법구를 이 온조사에 보관하게 된 것이라 한다. 센고쿠 시대 다케다 집안의 시조로 추앙되었던 무장 미나모토노 요시미쓰가 이곳에서 관례를 올리고 신라사부로(新羅三郞)를 칭한 이래 다케다 집안에서도 이 신라대명신을 가신(家神)으로 섬기게 되었다고 한다. 현재의 신라선신당 건물은 조와 3년(1347년)에 아시카가 다카우지가 기부한 것이다.
앞서 엔닌이 당나라에서 오대산의 하나인 북대엽두봉(北台葉頭峰, 해발 3,058미터)에 올랐을 때 얻은 향나무로 만든 문수상을 귀국한 뒤인 죠간 3년(861년) 10월에 엔랴쿠사 경내에 따로 문수루(文殊樓)을 지어 모셨는데, 이 문수루는 훗날 오다 노부나가가 히에이 산을 불태웠을 때 소실되고 현재는 재건된 것이다. 이 문수루 옆에는 현재 장보고기념비가 세워져 있다.

개요
성은 이(李), 이름은 선(愃), 본관은 전주(全州), 자는 윤관(允寬). 호는 의재(毅齋)이다.
영조의 둘째 아들로 생후 1년만에 왕세자로 책봉되었으며 1749년(영조 25년) 어명으로 대리청정을 시작하였으나 노론, 부왕과의 마찰과 정치적 갈등을 빚다가 1762년(영조 38년) 어명으로 뒤주에 갇혀 아사하였다.
사후 지위만 복권되었고, 양주 배봉산에 안장되었다가 다시 아들 정조에 의해 수원 화성 근처 현륭원(융릉)에 안장되었다. 정조 즉위 후 장헌의 존호를 받았다.
정조는 재위 중 그를 왕으로 추존하려는 시도를 하였으나 노론계열의 반발로 무산되고 만다. 한편 부인 헌경왕후는 후일 저서 《한중록》에서 그가 의대증과 정신질환을 앓았다고 진술했고, 실록에도 그의 병이 기록되어 있는 것으로 보아 적어도 우울증이나 화병 같은 병을 앓고 있었던 것은 확실해 보인다.
시호와 존호는 사도수덕돈경홍인경지장윤융범기명창휴찬원헌성계상현희장헌세자였다가 후에 고종 때 국왕으로 추존되면서 장종(莊宗)의 묘호를 더하여 장종신문환무장헌광효대왕(莊宗神文桓武莊獻廣孝大王)이라고 하였다. 대한제국 때 황제로 격상되어 장조의황제(莊祖懿皇帝)로 추존되었다. 비교적 근래의 무속 신으로, 무속 신앙에서 모시는 신의 한 사람으로 숭배되었는데, 이때의 호칭은 뒤주대감이었다.

생애
탄생과 세자 책봉
사도세자 이선은 1735년 2월 13일(음력 1월 21일) 영빈 이씨의 소생인 영조의 서장자(차남)로 창경궁 집복헌(集福軒)에서 태어났다. 이복 형인 효장세자가 일찍 사망하였으므로 그는 생후 1년만에 원자(元子) 정호를 받았다. 그가 태어날 때 부왕 영조는 친히 어머니 영빈의 출산 장면을 지켜보았다. 
영빈 이씨가 원자(元子)를 집복헌(集福軒)에서 낳았다.
그때 나라에서 오랫동안 저사(儲嗣)가 없으니
사람들이 모두 근심하고 두려워하였는데,
이때에 이르러 온 나라에서 기뻐하고 즐거워하였다.
(중략)

여러 신하들이 번갈아 하례하는 말을 올리니,
임금이 말하기를,
""삼종(三宗, 효종 · 현종 · 숙종)의 혈맥이 장차 끊어지려 하다가
 비로소 이어지게 되었으니,
 지금 다행히 돌아가서 열성조(列聖祖)를 뵐 면목이 서게 되었다.
 즐겁고 기뻐하는 마음이 지극하니, 그 감회 또한 깊다."" 하였다.

영조의 둘째 아들이었으나 그는 후궁 출신 서자였다. 태어난 지 100일 만에 영조의 정비 정성왕후의 양자가 되고, 어머니인 영빈 이씨의 곁을 떠나 내시와 나인들 손에서 성장하였다. 그러나 그의 거처는 부왕 영조를 적대시하던 왕대비 선의왕후가 거처하던 저승전(儲承殿) 이었고, 저승전 옆에는 지난 희빈 장씨가 거주하던 취선당(就善堂)이 있었다. 세자는 그들로부터 경종 독살설과 노론에 대한 부정적인 시각을 접하게 된다. 이때 저승전의 나인들 중 한상궁과 이상궁이 주로 세자를 대하였는데, 이들은 각각 자신들의 역할을 분담하여 세자를 훈육하였다.
정비는 후에 영의정을 지낸 홍봉한의 딸 혜경궁 홍씨이다. 1736년 3월 왕세자에 책봉되었다. 그는 영조의 맏아들이며 이복 형인 효장세자가 일찍 죽었고 영조의 나이 40세가 넘었으므로 태어난 지 1년 만에 세자에 책봉되었다.

세자 시절
어려서부터 매우 영특하여 3세 때 〈효경〉을 읽고, 〈소학〉의 예를 실천했다. 8세 때는 직접 친필로 동몽선습 등의 내용을 그대로 따라 베끼기도 했다. 또한 일찍이 높은 정치적 안목을 가지고 있었다. 10세 때 참봉 홍봉한의 딸 홍씨를 간택하여 혼인하였다. 딸이 세자와 가례를 올린 뒤 홍봉한은 과거에 급제하고, 홍봉한은 과거 급제 후 10년도 안돼 종2품으로 승진하여 광주부윤이 되는 등의 출세가도를 달렸다.
부왕 영조는 자신이 무수리의 자식이라 갖게 된 한이 있어 아들 사도세자에게서는 무수리의 자식스러운 모습을 결코 보기 싫어했다고 전해진다. 그는 어렸을때부터 부왕 영조로부터 소학과 학문에만 열중하는게 세자의 도리라고 해서 소학과 학문에만 열중하였다. 그러다가 이상궁과 한상궁이 칼과 칼집을 가지고 와 전쟁놀이도 하였다. 나이 어린 세자가 노는 것은 문제가 없었지만 사도세자는 자기 어머니인 영빈 이씨한테 전쟁놀이를 하였음에도 소학과 학문을 하였다고 거짓을 고하는등 날이가면 갈수록 거짓이 심해졌다. 이를 안 영조는 매우 분노하였으며 몸소 저승전까지 가서 사도세자에게 꾸중을 했다고 한다. 영조는 이상궁과 한상궁을 추궁하는 것을 마치지 않고 호된 형벌을 하여 궐 밖으로 내치라는 어명이 떨어졌고 결국 이상궁과 한상궁은 형벌을 받다 죽었다. 혜경궁 홍씨가 쓴 한중록에 의하면 이 일로 인해 그는 어렸을 때부터 부왕 영조로부터 극심한 불신과 가혹한 꾸중을 들었다고 하며, 이 때문에 그의 마음에는 불안과 공포의 그림자가 드리워졌다고 하고 영조를 두려워하고 무서워했으며 영조 앞에서는 말 한마디도 못했다고 한다.
날이 갈수록 청심환을 먹지 않고서는 영조 앞에 제대로 서 있지도 못하였으며, 그 상태에서 영조가 무슨 말을 하려고만 해도 곧바로 기절해버릴 정도였다고 한다. 혜경궁 홍씨의 한중록에 의하면 이는 공포증과 광증(狂症)으로 표출되었다고 한다.
15세가 되는 1749년(영조 25년) 승명대리(承命代理)로 대리청정(廳政)을 시작했다. 영조는 세자를 심히 못마땅히 여기면서도 마땅한 대안이 없다는 까닭으로 세자에게서 대리청정을 거두지 않았다. 영조로부터 칭찬이나 격려는커녕 호통과 때로는 폭설을 들으면서도 세자는 세자된 책임으로서 대리청정을 수행하였다.
1750년 혜경궁 홍씨로부터 첫 아들인 세손 정(琔)이 태어난다. 세손 정의 출생으로 갈등이 일시적으로 완화되었다. 영조는 새로 태어난 세손에게 각별하였다. 남자가 귀해진 왕실에서 그것도 늘그막에 본 귀한 손자라 퍽 이뻐하였고, 사도세자는 아들인 세손을 방패 삼아 영조의 불호령으로부터 피할 수 있었다라 전해진다. 그러나 세손이 유아임에도 병을 앓았고, 영조는 세자가 세손을 제대로 보양하지 못 함이라며 다시 세자에게 칼날을 세웠고 둘 사이는 다시 어긋나기 시작했다. 결국 세손 정은 생후 3년만에 요절하였고, 세자는 부왕과 갈등으로 극심한 스트레스 속에서 1752년 둘째 아들 산을 출산한다. 한편 세손 정을 각별히 아꼈던 영조는 어린 세손의 장지와 묘비문, 행장을 직접 지어서 남기며 애통해하였고, 둘째 세손 산을 원손이나 세손에 책봉하는 것도 의소세손의 3년상을 마친 뒤에 하도록 했다.
영조가 귀애하던 화평옹주의 상 중에 태어난 터라 영조는 혜경궁 홍씨의 출산을 도운 영빈 이씨에게도 책망 할 정도로 아기를 몹시 싫어했다고 한다. 이에 세자는 나 하나도 버거운데 아이는 어찌하나 한탄했다고 한다. 이 아이가 후일의 정조가 된다.

대리청정 기간
대리청정
1752년(영조 28년) 훗날 정조가 될 세손이 태어난 해 영조가 병석에 눕자 사도세자는 부왕 영조의 명으로 대리청정을 하게 되었다. 세자는 노론의 의견을 일방 듣지 않고 소론도 일부 등용하였다. 이인좌의 난과 관련하여 소론 온건파 이광좌 등의 처벌, 추탈을 요구했지만 세자는 거절하였다. 노론은 영조에게 세자가 잘못된 정치관을 갖고 있다고 고해바쳤다.
영조가 약내를 맡고는 이런 저런 흠을 잡아 면박을 주며 물리치자 세자는 밖에 우두커니 서서 미동도 하지 아니했다. 이에 신하들이 병석의 영조에게 약을 권할 것을 종용하자 이를 거절하고 이것으로 둘째 세손의 탄생으로 인한 화해의 기미는 날라가고 만다. 세자는 영조가 약을 물리치는 것이 자신의 허물 때문이므로 약을 권할 면목조차 없다고 했으나, 영조는 그런 꾸짖음 하나 못 받느냐며 몹시 기분이 상했다.
세자는 대리청정을 하면서 여러 지방의 환곡에 대하여 덜어내고 더 받는 등 형편에 따라 세금을 조정하여 백성들의 짐을 경감시켜 주었고, 가난한 평민들을 괴롭히는 대동(大同)·군포(軍布)의 대전(代錢)·방납(防納)을 금지시켰다. 이런 선정으로 충청남도 아산군 온양의 온양 행궁 때는 백성들로부터 열의와 같은 환호를 받았다.
또한 소론 출신 재상 조현명, 이종성 등은 그를 정치적으로 후원하였고, 노론 중에서도 원칙론자인 유척기, 이천보 등이 그를 지지하였다.
노론에서는 사도세자에게 소론 제거와 이광좌 등에게 추죄를 할 것을 계속 요구했지만 사도세자는 거절하였고, 오히려 소론 4대신에게 우호적인 시각을 드러냈다. 이에 노론에서는 이인좌의 난 등을 언급했지만 세자는 듣지 않았다. 노론은 경계했고, 소론은 도리어 감격하였다. 노론에서는 세자가 자신들과 정견이 다르다고 보고 세자의 제거도 계획하는데, 훗날 벽파로 칭해지는 노론 내 일부 외에, 노론 내의 청명당, 노론시파 등 당내 다른 일부 인사들은 세자 배척에 반대하거나 불참한다.

영조, 노론과의 심각한 갈등과 정신질환
사도세자가 장인에게 보낸 한 편지 사도세자는“내 나이가 금년 15살 봄을 넘긴 지가 오래 됐으나 아직 한 번도 명릉(숙종의 능)에 나아가서 참배하지 못했습니다”라고 적어 아버지 영조와의 갈등을 표현하기도 했다. 그는 자신의 후견세력이자 신뢰할 곳으로 처가인 홍봉한 가문을 선택하였다.

1754년 10월 또는 11월에 홍봉한에게 보냈을 편지에서는 자신의 병을 걱정하고 불안해하는 모습도 드러난다. 특히 “나는 겨우 자고 먹을 뿐, 허황되고 미친 듯합니다”라는 내용은 조금씩 다른 표현으로 네 번 정도 반복됐다
사도세자는 장인에게 국가의 제도와 규칙이 설명된 서적과 지도를 구해 줄 것을 부탁하는 등 나라살림에 대한 관심을 나타내기도 했다.

그가 장인 홍봉한에게 보냈던 편지들 중에는 우울증을 호소하는 대목도 나온다. 1756년 2월 29일, 사도세자는 “나는 한 가지 병이 깊어서 나을 기약이 없으니, 다만 마음을 가라앉히면서 민망해할 따름입니다”라고 썼다. 그가 세상을 떠나기 6년 전 고백이다. 편지에는 아버지 영조에 대한 불만도 자세히 기록돼 있다. 사도세자는 만 14세인 1749년 장인에게 쓴 편지에서 “내 나이 올해로 이미 15세의 봄을 넘긴 지 오래되었습니다만 아직 한번도 숙종대왕의 능에 나아가 참배하지 못했습니다”라고 적었다. 여기에 대해서는'사도세자는 숙종대왕의 능에 참배하지 못하니 자신이 세자인지 자격지심을 느낀 것으로 보인다는 견해가 있다. 아버지의 갈등을 직접적으로 표현한 대목이라는 게 학계의 설명이다. 그러나 홍봉한이나 그의 집안에서는 사도세자의 서신에 응답하지 않았다. 도리어 혜경궁 홍씨 등은 사도세자의 행동을 자신의 친정에 알렸고, 이는 후일 일부 사학자들에 의해 음모론으로 발전하기도 한다.
노론의 대신들 역시 그의 실수와 비행을 영조에게 고해 바쳤다. 정성왕후 생존에는 유화적이었지만, 정성왕후가 죽은 후에는 영조와의 갈등이 더욱 깊어졌다. 세자궁에 있던 관료 조유진은 형수이기도 한 효순 현빈의 친정 조카였는데 사도세자는 그를 통해 자신의 형수의 동기간인 조재호와 연결, 서신을 주고받게 된다. 소론계열이었던 조재호는 좌의정, 판중추 등을 지낸 인물로 정순왕후의 책봉에 반대하다가 관직에서 물러나 춘천으로 은퇴하였다가, 후에 사도세자의 구원요청을 받고 한양으로 돌아온다. 하지만 사도세자를 구원하지 못하고 오히려 역공을 당해 사사된다.
한편 사도세자는 영조 즉위의 의리와 명분에 관련된 신임환국에 대해 부왕과는 다른 의견을 내놓았는데, 이 때문에 대립이 더욱 심화되었다는 의견도 있다. 이 때 김상로, 홍계희, 문성국, 김한구, 김귀주 등은 그를 수시로 탄핵, 비판하였고, 시댁이 소론 계열이었던 화완옹주 역시 그를 공격하는데 가담했다고 한다.(하지만 화완옹주가 사도세자를 모함했다는 증거는 다소 명확하지 않다.) 이에 그를 싫어하는 노론 당원들과 이에 동조하는 정순왕후 김씨(貞純王后 金氏), 숙의 문씨(淑儀 文氏) 등이 영조에게 세자를 무고하여 영조가 수시로 불러 크게 꾸짖었다 한다.
한편 당색으로는 노론이었던 혜경궁 홍씨 역시 세자에 대한 정보를 빼내 홍봉한, 홍인한 등에게 제공했다. 도움을 청할 곳이 없었던 사도세자는 형수인 효순현빈 조씨의 남동생이자, 영조가 탕평파로서 총해하던 조문명의 아들 조재호 등에게 도움을 청했다.

난폭한 행동 문제
한편 1760년 이후로 그는 알 수 없는 행동을 하게 된다. 혜경궁은 '경진년(1760) 이후로 세자가 얼마나 많은 사람을 죽였는지 기억할 수조차 없다고 했다. ‘세자를 폐위시키는 반교’에 따르면, 생모인 영빈이 영조에게 세자의 비행을 말하면서 내관과 나인 백여 명을 죽였고 불에 달궈 지지는 악형을 가했다고 했다. 세자는 주로 만만한 아랫사람들만 죽였다 고 한다.
그런데 가학증의 대상이 점차 확대됐다. 후궁은 물론 아내인 혜경궁 홍씨까지 공격했을 뿐만 아니라 시강원에서 세자를 가르치는 스승을 쫓아가 공격하려고 했다. 영조가 술을 마셨다고 의심했을 때였다. 아마 시강원 스승들이 일러바쳤다고 생각한 듯하다. 죽기 직전에는 생모 영빈까지 죽이려고 했다. 이런 와중에 그는 창덕궁 낙선재 우물에서 자살을 시도하기도 했다. 평양으로 탈출하기도 했다. 일반불안장애, 강박장애, 충동조절장애를 겪던 세자는 1760년부터 정신분열증까지 겪게 된다. 헛것이 보이는 것이다. 그리고 아버지를 욕하기 시작했다. 세손(정조) 등이 생일을 축하하러 왔을 때는 “부모도 모르는 내가 자식을 어찌 알랴”라며 쫓아냈다.
1761년 1월 세자는 자신이 사랑하던 빙애를 죽였다. 옷을 갈아입다가 의대증이 발병해 죽였는데, 얻어맞은 빙애는 세자가 나간 뒤 신음하다가 절명했다. 수칙 박씨는 원래 숙종의 계비 인원왕후 김씨의 나인으로, 그 이름은 빙애였다. 사도세자의 부인 혜경궁 홍씨가 지은 《한중록》에는, 1757년(영조 33년) 음력 11월 11일 사도세자가 빙애를 취한 것으로 기록되어 있다. 그러나 당시의 기준에서 윗사람이 부리는 나인을 건드리는 것은 곧 윗사람의 물건을 취한 것으로 간주하여 일종의 금기사항으로 여겼기 때문에, 영조는 자신의 아들이 법통상 할머니가 되는 인원왕후의 나인을 건드린 것에 대해 매우 분개하였다고 한다. 한편 이 날의 《조선왕조실록》에는, 밤에 대신들이 입시한 상태에서 영조가 사도세자에게 양위를 발표하였다가 사도세자가 기절을 했다고 기록하고 있다 한편 빙애를 구타할 때 세자는 빙애와의 사이에서 낳은, 돌이 갓 지난 왕자 은전군(恩全君)도 칼로 쳤다. 그리고 그는 칼 맞은 은전군을 문밖 연못에 던졌다. 평소 사도세자를 경계하고 미워했던 정순왕후의 측근들 중에 세자의 주변에서 세자의 비행을 지켜보는 이들이 있었다. 이를 알고 영조의 계비 정순왕후는 은전군을 구하여 이름을 하엽생(荷葉生), 곧 '연잎이'라고 불렀다. 영조는 자신의 서손자 은전군의 자(字)를 연재(憐哉), '가련하도다!'로 지어주었다.

생애 후반
나경언의사고변 의문의 관서행
영조 37년 4월 세자는 평안도를 다녀오게 된다. 서명응이나 윤재겸등의 비판상소가 있었으나 장인인 홍봉한과 평안감사이자 화완옹주의 시숙인 정휘량의 도움으로 이일은 영조에게 알려지지 않았다. 당시 약관의 나이이던 정순왕후의 오빠 김귀주는 세자가 평양에 가도록 이를 막지 못하고 영조에게도 알리지 않은 홍봉한과 정휘량을 비판하는 밀봉상소를 영조에게 올렸다가 영조로부터 질책을 듣는다. 이일로 사건발생 5개월후에야 영조는 세자가 평양에 놀러간걸 알게된다. 또한 한중록에 의하면 이때 궁궐 바닥에 땅을 파고 공간을 마련하고 군기붙이를 숨겨두려 했다 한다.
그가 불시에 평안도를 방문한 목적과 단시간 내로 오고 간 방법, 한중록에서 지적하는, 그가 궁궐 밑에 비밀리에 땅을 파고 무기를 숨겨둔 사유에 대한 것은 실록이나 한중록 어디에도 나타나지 않고 있다.
1762년 6월 14일(음력 5월 22일) 영조 38년 나경언(羅景彦)이 세자의 결점과 비행을 10여 조에 걸쳐 열거하였다. 이를 본 영조는 크게 화를 내며 이런 사실들을 자기에게 알리지 않은 신하들을 질책한다. 나경언은 처형되었지만 영조는 세자에 대한 의혹을 거두지 않았다.
1762년(영조 38년) 윤5월 13일, 생모 영빈 이씨가 영조에게 세자를 처분하여 세손을 보호하라며 세자의 비행을 고변한다.

당시 세자를 폐하며 영조가 반포한 폐세자 반교문에는 생모 영빈이씨가 영조에게 고변한 내용이 나온다.
불길함을 예상한 사도세자는 일부러 아들 세손이 쓰던, 크기가 작은 휘항(방한모자)를 쓰고 고의로 학질병에 걸린 것, 혹은 정신질환이 심각해진 것처럼 연기하려 했다가 혜경궁 홍씨의 제지를 받았다. 자신이 죽을 것을 예감한 그는 자신은 폐하고 세손은 효장세자의 아들이 될 것이라 하기도 했다. 한중록에 의하면 혜경궁이 휘항모자를 빼앗자, 일부러 쓰는 것인데 빼앗는다며 나는 죽고 자네는 세손 데리고 오래 살라고 말했다 한다.

최후
임오화변
1762년 7월 4일(윤 5월 13일) 결국 아버지 영조는 세자를 폐하여 서인으로 삼고, 휘령전 앞 쌀 담는 뒤주 속에 세자를 가두었다. 영조가 세자를 뒤주에 들어가라 하자, 당시 무겸선전관 이석문은 어린 세손 산을 도와 입궐하려 했으나, 수문장들이 이를 저지하였다. 윤 5월 13일 설서(設書) 권정침(權正枕)과 사서(司書) 임성(任誠)이 세자의 아들인 세손을 모시고 와서 안으로 들어가고자 했으나 수문장이 이를 거절했다. 무겸선전관 이석문은 세손을 등에 업고 수문장들을 밀친뒤 세손을 궁으로 들여보냈다. 세손이 영조에게 가서 아비를 살려달라고 구원을 청하였다.
세손이 영조에게 아비를 살려달라 하자 영조는 내관을 시켜 세손을 내보냈다. 세자시강원의 사부였던 윤숙과 임덕제가 현장에 달려왔고, 윤숙은 세자의 처벌은 안된다고 거듭 주장하다가 내쳐졌다. 이때 권정침(權正忱), 이이장(李彝章), 임성(任珹), 윤숙(尹塾), 임덕제(林德躋) 등이 땅에 머리를 찧고 울며 세자의 억울함을 간하였다. 화가 난 영조는 권정침을 참형에 처하려 했으나 무겸선전관 이석문, 선전관 홍화보(洪和輔)와 함께 이를 의로운 행동으로 여겨 명을 거부하였다.
어린 세손 산은 곧 끌려나갔고, 이석문은 엎드려 울며 물러나지 않았다. 영조는 이석문에게 뒤주에 큰 돌을 올리라고 명하였지만, 이석문은 죽더라도 못하겠다며 역시 거부하고 실행하지 않았다. 윤숙은 당시 정승이던 홍봉한, 신만이 세자사(世子師)라는 직책까지 가지고 있으면서, 일이 이지경이 되도록 방치했다며 홍봉한, 신만을 현장에서 탄핵하기도 했다.

영조는 곧 여승 가선과 환자 박필수, 평양 기생 5명을 체포하여 추국한 뒤 세자를 타락시킨 죄로 사형에 처했다. 한편 홍봉한, 신만, 김성응 등은 상소를 올려 세자의 스승인 윤숙, 임덕제를 유배했다. 
임금이 창덕궁에 나아가 세자를 폐하여 서인(庶人)으로 삼고,
안에다 엄히 가두었다.
처음에 효장세자(孝章世子)가 훙(薨)하여 임금에게는 오랫동안 후사(後嗣)가 없다가
세자가 탄생하기에 이르렀는데, 타고난 자질이 탁월하여 임금이 매우 사랑하였다.
그러나 10여세 이후에는 점차 학문에 태만하게 되었고,
대리(代理)한 후부터 질병이 생겨 천성을 잃었다.
처음에는 대단치 않았기 때문에 신민(臣民)들이 낫기를 바랐었다.
(중략)

임금이 경희궁으로 이어하자 두 궁(宮) 사이에 점점 의심하는 마음이 생기게 되었고,
또 환관, 기녀와 함께 절도 없이 놀면서 하루 세 차례의 문안 인사를 모두 폐하였으니,
임금의 뜻에 맞지 않았으나 이미 다른 후사가 없었으므로
임금이 매번 나라를 위해 근심하였다.

임금이 세자에게 명하여 땅에 엎드려 관을 벗게 하고,
맨발로 머리를 땅에 조아리게 하고
이어서 차마 들을 수 없는 전교를 내려 자결할 것을 재촉하니,
세자의 조아린 이마에서 피가 나왔다.
(중략)

세손(정조)이 들어와 관(冠)과 포(袍)를 벗고 세자의 뒤에 엎드리니,
임금이 안아다가 시강원으로 보내고 김성응(金聖應) 부자(父子)에게 수위(守衛)하여
세손이 또다시 들어오지 못하게 하라고 명하였다.
임금이 칼을 들고 연달아 차마 들을 수 없는 전교를 내려 동궁의 자결을 재촉하니,
세자가 자결하고자 하였는데 춘방(春坊, 세자궁)의 여러 신하들이 말렸다.
임금이 이어서 폐하여 서인을 삼는다는 명을 내렸다.
(중략)

세자가 곡하면서 다시 들어가 땅에 엎드려 애걸하며 개과천선하기를 청하였다.
임금의 전교는 더욱 엄해지고 영빈이 고한 바를 대략 진술하였는데,
영빈은 바로 세자의 탄생모(誕生母) 이씨(李氏)로서 임금에게 밀고(密告)한 자였다.
도승지 이이장(李彛章)이 말하기를,
""전하께서 깊은 궁궐에 있는 한 여자의 말로 인해서 국본(國本)을 흔들려 하십니까?"" 하니,
임금이 진노하여 빨리 방형(邦刑)을 바루라고 명하였다가 곧 그 명을 중지하였다.
드디어 세자를 깊이 가두라고 명하였는데, 세손(정조)이 황급히 들어왔다.
임금이 빈궁(혜경궁 홍씨)과 세손 및 여러 왕손을 좌의정 홍봉한의 집으로 보내라고 명하였는데,
이때에 밤이 이미 반이 지났었다.

최후
1762년 7월 5일 세손을 들여보낸 일, 뒤주에 큰 돌 올려놓기를 거부했던 선전관 이석문은 항명죄로 삭탈관직당하고 의금부로 끌려갔다. 영조는 의금부에서 이석문을 친히 직접 국문한 뒤, 곤장 50도를 가하고 도성에서 쫓아냈다. 이 일로 이석문은 모든 도구를 버리고(盡散宦具), 도연명(陶淵明)의 귀거래사(歸去來辭)를 지어 바치고 낙향하였다.
그 뒤 동궁의 관료들이 뒤주의 틈으로 세자에게 미음(죽)과 물을 넣어주다가 발각, 영조는 이들의 출입을 금기하였다. 누군가가 세자가 갇힌 뒤주의 틈으로 미음(죽)과 물을 넣어준다는 것을 안 영조는 내관을 시켜 뒤주에 유약을 발라서 틈새, 통풍을 막는다. 영조는 선전관 구선복(具善復)을 시켜 뒤주를 감시하게 했고, 이 일로 세손 산(후일의 정조)은 구선복에게 원한을 품게 됐다. 사도세자는 감시가 엄해지기 전에 이미 소지하고 있던 부채를 반으로 쪼개 그것으로 본인의 오줌을 받아 마셨다. 그로부터 3,4일 만에 세자는 뒤주에서 굶어죽고 만다. 8일 뒤인 윤5월 21일 아사한 세자의 죽음이 확인되자 세자의 위호(位號)를 복구하고 사도(思悼)라는 시호를 내렸다.
이후 정조는 1776년(정조 1년) 장헌세자(莊獻世子)로 아버지의 시호와 원호 영우원을 상시하였다. 당시 세자의 나이 향년 27세였다.
사후 시신은 염습한 직후 홍낙임 등 처가 친정 일족이 관곽을 메고 7월 23일 경기도 양주군 고양주면 남중량포(南中梁浦, 현 서울특별시 동대문구 휘경동 29-1번지) 배봉산 갑좌(甲坐, 동북동쪽) 경향(庚向, 서쪽을 바라보는 자리), 후일의 서울시립대학교 동쪽 언덕에 안장되었다가 아들 정조가 즉위하면서 현위치(경기도 화성시 태안읍 안녕리 산1-1)로 옮겨진다.

금기와 복권
사도세자가 살인을 수시로 한 것은 자신이 직접 반성한 기록이나 죽은 사람들의 이름, 영조의 말 등을 볼 때 일부 사실로 추정된다.

 
정축년(1757년)과 무인년(1758년) 이후부터 병의 증세가 더욱 심해져서
병이 발작할 때에는 궁비(宮婢)와 환시(宦侍)를 죽이고, 죽인 후에는 문득 후회하곤 하였다.
임금이 매양 엄한 하교로 절실하게 책망하니, 세자가 의구심으로 인하여 병이 심하게 되었다.

죽은 지 보름만에 복권되었다. 이때 영조가 사도라는 시호를 내린 것은 종사를 위해 결단을 내린 후 은정을 베푼 것이라고 영조가 말한 바 있다. 사도라는 시호의 뜻은 追悔前過曰思 , 年中早夭曰悼 (자신의 과오를 반성하고 일찍 죽었다는 의미이다)
1764년(영조 40년) 봄 경복궁 서쪽 순화방에 사당인 사도묘(思悼廟)를 지었다가 홍봉한등이 너무 화려하게 지었다는 이유로 허물고 동년 여름, 창경궁 홍화문 밖으로 옮겨서 수은묘(垂恩廟)라 하였다.
영조 40년 음력 2월 20일 세손은 사후 세자의 처분을 뒤집어 추숭할 것을 우려한 영조의 명에 의해 효장세자의 양자로 입적되며 영조에게 다시한번 사도세자를 추숭하지 말것을 다짐받는다.

사후
즉위 후 정조는 장헌세자라는 존호를 올리고 수은묘(垂恩墓)의 이름을 영우원(永祐園)으로, 수은묘(垂恩廟)는 경모궁(景慕宮)으로 올려 국왕의 생부로서 존대했다. 정조는 경모궁안에 자신의 초상화를 걸어두고 항상 아버지의 사당을 바라보게 하였다 한다. 이어 수덕돈경(綏德敦慶)의 존호를 올리고, 1784년 홍인경지(弘仁景祉)의 추가 존호를 올렸다. 1789년 10월 7일 정조는 영우원을 수원의 화산으로 옮긴 뒤 현륭원(顯隆園)이라 하고 국왕의 능묘에 버금가는 규모로 지었다. 정조는 생전 그를 왕으로 추존하려는 시도를 하였으나 노론의 반대와 반발에 부딛쳐 무산되었다. 결국 고종 때 가서야 그는 왕으로 추존된다.
정조는 사도세자를 추존하려 시도했으나 여러번 반발과 반대에 부딛쳤다. 금등 문서를 공개한 뒤에도 사도세자 추존 상소문은 계속 올라왔고, 정조는 사도세자 복권 여론, 사도세자 추존 여론을 청하는 상소에 대해 읽어보고 비통해하면서도, 그들을 처벌하여 영조의 유지를 지켰다. 그러나 정조는 못내 아쉬워하여 서유린(徐有隣) 등에게 사도세자를 추존하고 싶어하는 속마음을 털어놓았고, 이는 서유린의 아들 서준보(徐俊輔)와 증손자 서상조(徐相祖)에게도 전해졌다. 순조 때에 일각에서 사도세자 추존 여론이 나왔다가 오래된 일을 다시 꺼낸다며 거절당하면서 잊혀졌지만, 1855년(철종 6) 서준보가 사도세자의 추존을 청하는 상소를 올렸고 1899년 8월 3일 서상조가 다시 사도세자를 추존할 것을 청하는 상소를 올려 고종이 최종적으로 수락하게 된다.

황제 추존
1899년(광무 3년) 9월 1일 고종 황제는 그를 임금으로 추대하고 11월 13일 묘호는 장종(莊宗)이라고 하였다.
1899년(광무 3년) 10월 17일 , 고종은 개국 시조인 태조와 자신의 4대 조상인 장종(사도세자), 정조, 순조, 익종(효명세자)을 소급하여 황제로 추존하였다. 이때 장종의 묘호를 장조(莊祖)로 개칭하였다. 능호는 융릉(隆陵)이다. 무속에서도 장조를 왕자신(뒤주대감)으로 모신다.

가족 관계
기타
아들 정조는 부왕 영조의 명에 따라 효장세자의 양자로 입양되었다. 그는 영조의 유지에 따라 효장세자를 왕으로 추존하고 청나라에 상주하여 시호까지 받았으나 못내 못마땅해 했다 한다. 그는 사후 아버지 사도세자의 곁에 묻히기를 소원하였는데, 1800년 정조 사후 그의 묘소 아래에 매장되었다가, 현재의 건릉의 위치로 옮겨졌다.
그는 한국 민간과 무속에서 신으로도 숭배되어 군왕신(君王神)의 하나로도 모셔진다. 무속신으로서의 호칭은 뒤주대감이다. 그가 뒤주에 갇혀 죽은 것에서 연원하는 호칭이다.
화완옹주를 근친상간한 것은 사도세자를 모함하기 위해서 화완옹주 자신이 거짓으로 지어내어 영조에게 고했다는 논란이 존재한다.

세종의 왕자 영응대군의 부인 대방군부인 송씨는 그의 고모이자 시숙모이다.

생애
생애 초기
본관은 여산으로 전라북도 정읍군 태인면(현 칠보면)에서 태어났으며, 판돈녕부사 등을 역임하였고 영돈녕부사로 추증된 여량부원군(礪良府院君) 송현수(宋玹壽)의 딸이다. 어려서 아버지 송현수를 따라 한성부로 이사하였다.

왕비 간택과 폐비
성품이 공손하고 검소해 가히 종묘를 영구히 보존할 수 있는 인물이라 하여 간택되었는데, 그 배경에는 고모가 영응대군의 부인이라는 점이 크게 작용하였다. 1454년 2월 19일(음력 1월 22일)에 열넷의 나이로 한 살 연하였던 단종과 혼인하여 왕비에 책봉되었다. 1455년, 단종이 수양대군(세조)에게 왕위를 일임하고 상왕이 되자 왕대비가 되어 의덕(懿德)의 존호를 받았다. 그러나 1457년, 성삼문, 박팽년 등 사육신이 추진하던 단종 복위 운동이 발각되자 상왕 단종은 노산군(魯山君)으로 강봉되어 영월로 유배되었고, 의덕왕대비는 군부인이 되어 궁에서 쫓겨났다.

노비로 전락
친정마저 풍비박산 난 상태였던 그는 동대문 밖 숭인동 청룡사 근처에 초암을 짓고 시녀들과 함께 살았다. 송씨는 시녀들이 동냥해온 것으로 끼니를 잇고 염색업을 하며 어렵게 살았는데, 이를 안 세조가 집과 식량 등을 내렸으나 끝내 받지 않았다. 한편, 그를 가엾게 여긴 동네 아녀자들이 조정의 눈을 피해 그의 집으로 먹을 것을 건네주고자 시장을 조직하는 일도 있었다.
청계천에 있는 영도교(永渡橋)는 귀양 가는 단종과 정순왕후가 마지막으로 헤어진 곳으로 전해지는데, 결국 두 사람은 이승에서는 만날 수 없었다. 단종이 끝내 유배지인 영월에서 생을 마감했기 때문이다. 부군의 죽음을 전해 들은 송씨는 매일 아침 저녁으로 큰 바위를 올라 영월을 향해 통곡을 하며 단종의 명복을 빌었다. 이후 세조는 그에 대해 '신분은 노비이지만 노비로서 사역할 수 없게 하라'는 명을 내려 아무도 범하지 못하도록 정업원(淨業院)으로 보냈다. 정업원은 부군을 잃은 후궁들이 출궁하여 여생을 보냈던 곳이다.
후일, 영조가 친히 동망봉(東望峰)이라는 글씨를 써서 바위에 새기게 하였다. 일제강점기 때 동망봉 근처 지역이 채석장으로 쓰였으며 그 바위는 깨어져나가버렸다. 2011년 현재, 서울 종로구 낙산 근처인 이곳 동망봉 남쪽에는, 동망정이라는 이름의 정자가 들어서 있다.
한편 조선 말의 문장가이자 역사가인 김택영은 자신이 지은 야사에서 ""신숙주가 그를 자신의 종으로 달라고 했다.""라고 주장했는데, 이에 대해서는 반론이 많아 사실 여부는 알 수 없다

죽음과 그 이후
그는 세조의 증손이자 단종의 종손뻘인 중종(中宗) 16년인 1521년 7월 7일(음력 6월 4일), 81세의 나이로 한 많은 생을 마감했다. 중종의 재위 초기, 사림파인 조광조 등에 의해 복위가 주장됐으나 중종은 이를 거부했다. 그 뒤 현종 때부터 송시열과 김수항 등은 단종과 그의 복위를 거듭 건의했다. 그들은 세조의 단종 살해는 측근들의 오도에 휘둘린 것이며 본심은 단종 살해에 있지 않았다고 주장했다. 그 건의로 1698년 12월 7일(숙종 24년 음력 11월 6일), 단종과 그는 복위되어 시호를 받고 종묘 영녕전에 신위가 모셔졌다.
그의 별세 때에는 대군부인의 격에 따라 치러진 장례로 경기도 양주군(楊州) 군장리(群場里, 현재의 남양주시 진건읍 사릉리)에 매장됐다. 단종과 그의 복위로 종묘에 배향되면서 능호를 사릉(思陵)이라 했는데 이는 억울하게 살해된 남편을 사모(思慕)한다는 뜻에서 지은 것이다.
그의 묘소 뒤편에 심은 나무들이 단종의 능인 장릉쪽을 향해 고개숙여 자란다는 전설이 한 때 전해졌다. 무속의 신의 한 명으로 숭배됐는데, 무속에서는 그를 송씨부인 신이라 부른다.

생애
879년 왕이 행차하여 울산 개운포(開雲浦 : 현재 울산화학공단과 온산화학공단 사이 외황강 하구 지역)에 이르렀을 때, 이상한 생김새와 괴이한 의복을 입은 용왕의 아들이라고 자처하는 처용이라는 자가 왕 앞에 나타나 노래하고 춤추며 왕을 따라 서라벌까지 왔다. 처용은 급간이라는 벼슬을 받고 달밤이면 나가 춤추고 노래하다가 마침내는 그 행방을 감추어 버렸다. 《악부(樂府)》에 그의 춤이 “처용무”(處容舞) 또는 “상염무”(想髥舞)라고 전해지고 있다. 1505년 조선 연산군 때는 내관 김처선이 처형당한 것을 연유로 공문서를 비롯한 모든 문서에서 “처(處)”자 사용을 엄금하여 이때는 처용을 풍두(豊頭)라고 하였다.

처용 설화
처용은 한국 민간 전승과 무속 신앙에서 하나의 신으로 숭배한다.
전설에 따르면, 처용이 외부에 출타중인 사이 역신(疫神: 질병을 전파하는 신)이 처용 아내와 동침하였다. 처용은 이를 발견하였으나 분노하지 않고 향가인 〈처용가〉를 노래 부르며 춤을 추었다고 한다. 그 인품에 감격한 역신은 처용이 있는 곳에 다시 나타나지 않겠다고 약조하고 사라졌다고 한다.
고려시대 이후 새해 초나 질병이 돌 때 문 앞에 처용 얼굴을 한 그림을 붙이면 질병이 전파되지 않는다는 믿음이 있었다.

해석
호국룡 신앙
불교 학자로 한국 고대 불교를 연구한 고익진은 자신의 저서 《한국 고대불교 사상사》에서, 처용에 관련된 내용은 신라 상대 말기와 중대 초기의 초전기 불교의 건전한 호국룡(護國龍) 신앙이 신라 하대에서 타락하고 무속화하였음을 보여준다고 해석하였다.

49대 헌강왕을 보좌한 처용은 동해 용의 아들로 자기 처(왕이 주선해 줌)의 미색을 범한 악신을 주술로 물리치고, 왕은 또 용을 위해 망해사(신방사)를 지어주고 있다. “에로티시즘”과 주술이 용신앙 속에 짙게 깔려 있음을 본다. 이것은 초전기 불교의 건전한 “호국룡” 신앙과 비교할 때 타락하고 무속화한 하대 불교의 신앙형태를 보여 주고 있는 것이다.

아랍, 페르시아인
처용을 아랍, 페르시아인이라고 보는 사람들은 처용 설화의 배경인 울산 개운포가 통일 신라 시대 무역항으로 번성하였던 곳이며, 많은 아라비아 사람들이 개운포에 와서 신라와 국제 무역을 하였다고 주장한다. 2010년 발견된 쿠쉬나메 내용을 주장의 근거로 삼기도 한다. 쿠쉬나메는 7세기 사산조 페르시아의 멸망 후의 시대적, 정치적 상황을 광범위하게 다루고 있는 아랍권의 서사시이다. 쿠쉬나메의 내용에 따르면, 사산조 페르시아 멸망 후 페르시아 유민들은 중국, 신라로 망명하게 된다. 삼국유사에는 “개운포에서 자욱한 안개와 함께 헌강왕 앞에 나타난 자들이 동해 용왕과 일곱 아들이고 그 가운데 막내를 경주에 데려와 벼슬을 주고 아름다운 아내를 맞이하도록 했다”라고 기록하고 있다. 이와 같은 내용은 쿠쉬나메에서 아비틴이 페르시아 유민들과 함께 “신라로 기항해 항구에서 신라왕 타이후르의 아들 가람의 영접을 받았으며, 왕정을 보좌하고 왕과의 돈독한 사이를 유지! 신라의 공주 프라랑과 결혼한다”라는 내용과 유사하다. 그 동안 한국에 알려져 있지 않던 쿠쉬나메 자료는 한양대 이희수 교수에 의해 확인됐다. 부적 모양을 보면 외국 사람처럼 생겼는데 오만 문화부 장관은 처용을 오만 사람이라고 주장하였다. 이는 2005년 당시 국무총리 이해찬이 오만을 방문했을 때 오만 문화부 장관의 인삿말에서 나온 주장이다.

처용과 관련된 유적, 흔적
망해사 : 울산 울주군 율리 영취산에는 동해 용왕을 위해 헌강왕이 지었다는 망해사가 지금도 있다. '망해사(望海寺, 바다를 바라보는 절)'의 뜻처럼 망해사에서는 처용암이 있는 외항강 하구와 동해 바다가 보인다.
처용리 : 처용암이 있다고 하여 붙여진 울산 온산읍에 있는 리(理)의 지명
처용암 : 외황강 하구에 있는 바위로 처용이 여기서 났다고 전해진다.

생애
생애 초반
최영은 고려 후기의 학자로서 집현전태학사(集賢殿太學士)를 지낸 최유청(崔惟淸)의 5대손이며 최원직(崔元直)의 아들로 태어났다. 16세 때 최영은 사헌부 간관(司憲府諫官)을 지냈던 그의 부친 최원직으로부터 “너는 마땅히 황금보기를 돌 같이 하라.”라는 유훈(遺訓)을 받은 후 최영은 이를 그대로 평생의 좌우명으로 삼고 실천하였다.
어려서부터 기골이 장대하고 풍채가 늠름했으며 용력이 출중하여 문신 가문에 태어났으면서도 병서를 읽고 무술을 익히어 무장의 길을 걸었다.

관료 생활
변방 수비와 쌍성총관부 공격
처음에는 무인으로서 양광도 도순문사(都巡問使)의 휘하에 있으면서 여러 번 왜구를 토벌하여 공을 세웠으며, 우달치에 임명되었다. 1352년(공민왕 원년) 음력 9월에 조일신의 역모를 안우(安祐)·최원(崔源) 등과 함께 진압하여 호군(護軍)으로서 출세하게 되었다.
당시 고려는 80년 넘게 원나라(元)의 지배를 받고 있었다. 1354년(공민왕 3년) 중국 산동 지역에서 장사성(張士誠) 등의 홍건적이 원 조정에 반기를 들자 원은 고려에 이들을 토벌하기 위한 조정군(助征軍)을 요청했는데, 이때 최영은 대호군(大護軍) 대장군으로서 류탁(柳濯)·염제신(廉悌臣) 등과 함께 병력 2천 명과 함께 출정했다. 이때 그의 나이 39세였고 원에서 대기 중이던 고려인 2만 명을 합류시켜 지휘하였다.
1355년(공민왕 4년)에 원정에서 돌아온 최영은 왕명으로 예전 원에게 침식된 동북면의 쌍성총관부를 수복하고, 서쪽으로 압록강을 넘어 요양에 이르는 실지 회복에 나섰다. 쌍성총관부 전투에서 등장하는 자가 바로 이성계와 그의 아버지 이자춘으로 최영은 이 두 사람의 도움으로 쌍성총관부를 되찾을 수 있었고, 두 사람은 이후 고려의 역사에 등장하게 된다.

홍건적과 왜구 격퇴
원나라도 가만히 있었던 것은 아니었다. 홍건적과 제위 계승을 둘러싸고 내우외환을 겪으면서도 자신들에게 등을 돌린 공민왕을 밀어내고 덕흥군(德興君)을 왕으로 세우고자, 기황후의 지원을 받은 최유가 군사 1만을 이끌고 1364년에 고려로 쳐들어왔다. 그러나 이 침략도 최영이 처리하였다. 그러나 최영과 고려가 맞서 싸워야 했던 적은 원나라만이 아니었다. 북쪽 지방에서는 홍건적이, 남쪽 지방에는 왜구가 창궐하였다.
공민왕 7년(1358년)에는 양광·전라도 왜적 체복사(倭賊體覆使)가 되어 오예포(吾乂浦 : 장연)에 침입한 왜구 4백여 척을 격파하고, 1365년(공민왕 14년)에는 왜구가 교동(喬桐)·강화(江華)를 노략질하자 동서강도지휘사(都指揮使)로 왜구를 대적, 경계하였다. 그러나 공민왕 14년(1365년) 3월 11일 창릉에 침입한 왜구가 세조의 어진을 훔쳐가는 사건이 벌어지고, 직후 동서강도지휘사는 김속명으로 교체되었으며, 이때 세조의 어진을 왜구에게 도난당한 것이 빌미가 되어 신돈에 의해 계림부윤(鷄林府尹)에 좌천되었으나, 1371년(공민왕 20년)에 신돈이 처형되고 그 일파가 몰락하자 곧 소환되어 문하찬성사(門下贊成事)가 되었다.

목호의 난 진압과 왜구와의 교전
그 후로도 1374년(공민왕 23년)에는 제주도에서 일어난 목호(牧胡)의 난을 진압하였으며, 1376년(우왕 2)에는 왜구가 삼남지방을 휩쓸고 원수 박원계(朴元桂)가 참패당하자, 최영은 육군을 이끌고 논산시 연산면의 개태사(開泰寺)로 올라오는 왜구를 홍산(鴻山)에서 크게 무찔러 철원 부원군(鐵原府院君)에 피봉되었다. 이 뒤부터 왜구가 최영을 백수 최만호(白首崔萬戶)라 하여 몹시 무서워하게 되었다 한다. 1377년 서강(西江)에 쳐들어온 왜군을 격퇴한뒤, 1378년(우왕 4년)에는 왜구가 승천부(昇天府 : 풍덕(豊德))에 쳐들어와서 개경까지 위태하여 한때 그 형세가 자못 불리하였으나, 이성계·양백연(楊伯淵) 등과 힘을 합하여 적을 쳐서 섬멸시키고 안사공신(安社功臣)의 호를 받았다. 1380년 왜구의 침략으로 도읍을 철원으로 옮기려 하자 최영은 해도도통사(海道都統使)로서 왜구 때문에 수도를 천도할 수 없다며 계획을 반대하여 철회시켰다.
조정에서 탐라 토벌을 위해 편성된 각 군대의 지휘관은 다음과 같다.

양광전라경상도통사 - 최영(당시 문하찬성사)
도병마사 - 염흥방(당시 밀직제학)
양광도원수 - 이희필(상원수, 당시 삼사좌사), 변안렬(부원수, 당시 판밀직사사)
전라도원수 - 목인길(상원수, 당시 찬성사), 임견미(부원수, 당시 밀직)
경상도원수 - 지윤(상원수, 당시 판숭경부사), 나세(부원수, 당시 동지밀직사사)
삼도조전원수 겸 서해도순문사 - 김유(당시 지문하사)

생애 후반
조반의 난과 권문세족 숙청
우왕이 그의 서녀 영비 최씨를 자신의 비로 삼겠다고 강요하자, 최영은 스스로 죽음을 택하겠다고 거절하였으나 우왕이 끝내 요구하므로 마지못해 승락하였다. 1381년 영삼사사(領三司事) 등을 지내고 벼슬을 사퇴하였다.
우왕 13년(1387) 조정에서 전횡을 일삼던 염흥방(廉興邦, ? ～ 1388)의 종 이광(李光)이 조반(趙胖, 1341년 ~ 1401년)의 땅을 빼앗자 조반은 이광을 죽였다. 그리고 이를 조정에 보고하였는데 염흥방은 오히려 조반이 난을 일으키려한다고 허위보고를 하였다.
1388년(무진년) 정월 초하루 염흥방은 우왕에게 강권하여 조반을 수배하였다. 체포된 조반은 순군옥에서 심문을 받았는데 “6, 7 명의 탐욕스러운 재상들이 사방에 종을 놓아 남의 노비와 토지를 빼앗고 백성들을 해치며 학대하니 이들이 큰 도적이다. 지금 이광을 벤 것은 오직 국가를 돕고 백성을 해치는 도적을 제거하려 한 것인데, 어찌 반란을 꾀한다고 하느냐.” 라고 항변하였다. 그러나 염흥방은 고문을 통해 기어코 반역 사건으로 몰려 했다.
염흥방은 젊어서 학문에 뛰어나 여러 번 동지공거(同知貢擧)가 되었고 개혁을 주창하는 인물이었으나 이인임에게 항거하다 귀양을 다녀온 이후 권문세도가와 친분을 쌓아 탐욕에 찬 간신이 되어 있었다. 우왕은 전횡을 일삼는 것을 더 이상 묵과할 수 없다하여 최영과 이성계에 명하여 병력을 동원, 왕궁을 숙위하게 하고 삼사좌사(三司左使) 염흥방을 비롯하여 영삼사사 임견미, 찬성사 도길부(都吉敷) 체포령을 내렸다.
우왕은 인사 발령을 하여 최영을 문하시중, 이성계를 수문하시중, 이색을 판삼사사, 우현보(禹玄寶)․윤진(尹珍)․안종원(安宗源)을 문하찬성사, 문달한(文達漢)․송광미(宋光美)․안소(安沼)를 문하평리, 성석린을 정당문학, 왕흥(王興)을 지문하사, 인원보(印原寶)를 판밀직사사로 임명하였다. - 『고려사』, 권113,「최영 열전」
오랫동안 전장에서 생활하며 왜구와 야인과의 전쟁에서 승리한 최영은 공로와 경륜과 함께 염흥방의 무고로 발생된 허위 조반의 난을 기회로 1388년에 문하시중의 지위까지 다시 올랐다. 그러나 1388년 2월부터 명나라와의 성 관계가 원활하지 못하던 중, 철령 이북의 땅을 명나라가 차지하겠다는 이른바 철령위 문제를 계기로 최영은 요동 정벌을 주장, 그 계획이 서자 그는 팔도 도통사(八道都統使)가 되어 결국 4월 요동정벌군을 이끌고 이성계, 조민수를 부장으로 삼아 우왕과 함께 평양에까지 출진하게 되었다.

요동정벌 준비
1388년(우왕 14년) 2월 명나라는 철령 이북의 땅이 원래 원나라의 쌍성총관부가 있던 지역으로 그곳을 명나라가 다스려야 한다는 논리를 내세워 철령위를 설치하고 관리를 파견하겠다는 통고를 고려에 보내 왔다. 반발한 최영은 4월, 우왕과 함께 요동을 공격할 것을 주장했다. 또한 이자송(李子松)이 요동정벌의 불가함을 최영에게 따지자 이자송을 임견미 일당으로 몬 후 곤장 107대를 때린 후 전라도 내상(內廂)으로 유배하기로 하였다가 얼마 뒤에 죽였다. 그리고 이성계는 요동 정벌을 반대하면서 그 이유로 4가지를 들었다.

. 소(작은나라)로서 대(큰나라)를 거역할 수는 없다.
. 농사철에 군대를 동원할 수는 없다.
. 모든 군사가 북쪽으로 몰려간 틈에 왜구가 쳐들어올 소지가 있다.
. 여름이라 비가 자주 내리므로 활의 아교가 녹아 쓰기 어렵고 군사들은 전염병에 시달린다.
이것이 이른바 '4불가론'이다. 그러나 요동정벌은 단행되었다. 그러나 이성계 등은 대국을 건드릴 수 없다 하며 위화도에서 회군을 단행하였다.

체포와 최후
5월 선봉대가 압록강 어귀의 작은 섬 위화도에 도착하였다. 최영은 압록강을 건너 진격하라는 명령을 내렸다. 하지만 이성계는 이에 불복, 군대를 돌려 거꾸로 수도 개경으로 향했다. 쿠데타가 시작된 것이다. 그러나 최영이 각별히 신임하여 자신의 가보인 보검까지 하사했던 좌군도통사 조민수는 위화도에서 우군도통사 이성계의 설득으로 회군에 협력하기로 결정, 말머리를 돌려 개경으로 돌아왔다. 당시 개경에 있던 정도전, 조준, 정몽주는 이성계에 대한 반감, 반대 여론을 무마시켰다.

최영은 크게 노했지만 이성계의 편으로 돌아선 장수들에 의해 감금된다. 이성계의 위화도 회군으로 뜻을 이루지 못하고 이를 맞아 싸우다가 이성계 일파에 붙잡혀 이내 투옥, 경기도 고봉(高峰 : 고양)에 유배되었다가 뒤에 개경으로 소환된 뒤 죽임을 당하였다. 이때 그의 나이 향년 73세. 이때 자신에게 탐욕이 있었다면 무덤에 풀이 자랄 것이고, 결백하다면 무덤에 풀이 자라지 않을 것이라 유언하고 최후를 맞이하였다. 실제로 그의 무덤에 풀이 자라지 않아서, 이에 적분(赤墳)이라 하였으며, 최근에는 유가족이 풀을 심어 놓았다.

사후
손쉽게 개경을 손에 넣은 이성계 일파는 최영을 귀양보냈다가 두달 후 죽였다. 이성계는 최영이 역모를 꾸몄다고 우왕에게 고하였고, 그 시신을 길에 내버리도록 하였다. 그러나 그의 최후가 너무도 당당해서 뭇 사람들이 감동한 나머지 시체가 버려진 곳을 지나는 사람마다 경의를 표했다고 한다. 조선 세종 때의 재상 중의 한사람인 맹사성은 그의 손녀사위로, 의정부 우의정과 좌의정을 지냈다.

평가
그의 평가는 크게 두 가지 정도로 엇갈린다. 첫째는, 고려의 만고 불변의 충신이다. 여러 난신적자들이 횡행하는 가운데서도 오직 나라와 백성을 위해서 왜구와 홍건적을
물리치고 왕에 충성하고자 했던 고려의 충신이다. 둘째는, 시대 흐름을 읽지 못한 고집스런 사람이다. 고려는 권문세가의 전횡으로 인하여 이미 그 나라의 명운이 다 하고 있었다. 수술로는 더 이상 살릴 수 없는 환자였던 것이다. 그런데도 불구하고 백성의 진정한 아픔을 해결하기 위하여 고려 대신에 새로운 세상이 생겨나서 자신들의 고단함을 해결하여 줄 것을 기대하는 백성의 마음을 헤아리지 못한 것이다. 그리하여 이성계에게 불운하게 죽었다.
그러나 확실한 것은 그의 나라와 백성을 생각하는 마음은 누구보다도 크고 위대했으며 우리가 본받아야 할 점이라는 것이다.

민간신앙화된 최영
무속에서 ‘최영 장군’은 수명장수, 안과태평의 신으로, 무에서 가장 많이 모시는 신령 가운데 하나이다.
제주도의 추자도에 최영의 사당이 있다. 상추자도 추자초등학교 북서쪽 벼랑위에 위치하고 있는 이 사당은 제주도기념물 제11호로 지정되어 있다. 최영이 1374년(공민왕 23년)에 제주도에 있는 몽고인 목장을 토벌할 목적으로 9월 30일(음력 8월 24일)부터 10월 4일(음력 8월 28일)까지, 또 토벌 종료 후인 10월 28일(음력 9월 23일)부터 11월 14일(음력 10월 10일)까지 추자도에 머물렀는데, 이 사당은 이때 주민을 많이 도와준 최영을 기념하기 위해 세워졌다는 설이 유력하다.

일화
《고려사》에서 ""평생을 군문(軍門)에 종사했지만 아는 얼굴이 두서넛에 불과했다""고까지 평가할 정도로 군대 내의 파벌 싸움과는 거리가 멀었다.
사치와 축재에 부정적인 입장이었다. 김용이 주살되고 얼마 지나지 않아, 김용이 생전에 가지고 있던 묘아안정주(猫兒眼精珠)라는 보옥이 조정에 바쳐져 관인들이 모두 돌아가며 구경하는 것을 보고 ""김용의 그 크던 뜻을 겨우 이까짓 물건이 더럽혀 놓았는데, 뭐가 그리 대단하다고 완상하시는가?"" 라며 비판하기도 했다. 《고려사》열전에는 어떻게 하면 관인이 될 수 있겠느냐고 묻는 사람에게 ""상공(商工)을 배우면 된다.""고 대답하였는데, 이것은 당시의 매관매직 세태를 비꼬아 대답한 것이었다.
《용재총화》와 《임하필기》에는, 당시 고려의 권세 있는 자들은 서로의 저택에 초대해서 성대한 연회를 열어 진기한 음식을 대접하며 사치를 부렸는데, 최영은 언젠가 재상들을 집에 초대해 한낮이 지나도록 아무 음식도 내놓지 않다가 날이 저물어서야 기장쌀을 섞어 지은 밥에다 잡다한 나물만 차려서 가져왔다. 오래 기다리다 지쳐 배가 고팠던 재상들은 마다하지 않고 남김없이 먹고는 ""최영의 집에서 먹은 음식이 (여지껏 먹었던 어떤 산해진미보다) 가장 맛있다""며 칭찬했고, 최영은 웃으며 ""이것도 병사들을 부리는 한 방법입니다.""라고 대답하였다고 한다.
공민왕 13년(1364년) 12월에 공민왕이 풍저창사(豐儲倉使) 정득년(丁得年)에게 ""환관에게 쌀을 내려주라""고 한 명령을 정득년이 양부(兩府)를 경유한 명령이 아니라며 따르지 않았고, 공민왕이 그를 장을 쳐서 귀양보내려 하였을 때 찬성사로써 나서서 ""책임은 신들에게 있고 득년의 죄가 아닙니다.""라고 변호해 풀어주게 했다(《고려사절요》)

최영의 무덤과 적분(赤墳)의 전설
최영의 묘는 풀이 돋지 않는 것으로 유명했는데 이에 따라서 적분(赤墳)이라고 불렸다. 1976년의 사초(莎草)이후부터 풀이 돋아 현재는 무성하다고 한다. 묘역 주변에 최근까지 큰 소나무가 빽빽하게 식재되어 있었는데 이로 인해 그늘이 져서 풀이 자라지 않은 것으로 추정된다. 적분(赤墳)이었을 때 우천 등으로 토사가 흘러내려 묘역이 훼손되었기에 후손들이 무덤에 떼를 입혔다고 한다. 경기도 고양시 덕양구 대자동에 있다. 최영 장군의 묘는 쌍분으로 되어 있는데 윗묘는 아버지 최원직의 묘이며 아랫묘가 최영 장군의 묘이다. 아내 문화 류씨와 합장되었다. 왼쪽에 후손이 세운 묘비가 있고 오른쪽에 충혼비가 있다.
2006년 묘소 주변 묘역이 명승지로 개발되는 계획이 세워졌다.

묘비
묘비 전면에 다음과 같은 묘비명이 새겨져 있다.

묘비명의 의미: 고려의 진충분좌명안사공신이며 판밀직사대장군이자 문하시중 겸 찬성사이며 육도도순찰사인 철원부원군 무민공 동주 최씨로 휘 영의 묘, 삼한대부인 문화유씨와 합장함.
묘비를 세운 이: 묘비 후면에 “18대손인 영태가 비를 세우고 종 19대 손인 종이품 가의대부 규근이 글을 쓰다. 무진 시월”이라고 적혀 있다.
충혼비: 최영 장군 충혼비는 1970년 대한민국 국방대학원과 문화공보부에서 세운 것이다.

가족 관계
우왕의 후궁이 된 영비 최씨는 그의 첩이 낳은 서녀였다. 따라서 우왕이 영비를 후궁으로 삼으려 했을 때 그는 간곡히 만류하였으나 왕이 듣지 않았다.

기타
이성계와의 비교
이성계는 당시 신흥 무인의 대표이자 신진사대부의 일원이었다. 이성계의 조상은 본래 전주에서 살다가 강원도를 거쳐 함경도 지방으로 옮겨가 그 지역의 유력자로 성장했다. 원이 그 자리에 쌍성총관부를 설치하면서 이성계의 아버지 이자춘은 원나라의 다루가치를 지냈다. 그러나 고려 공민왕이 쌍성총관부를 공격 할 때 이에 동조, 왕의 신임을 얻었다. 그리고 아버지 이자춘과 함께 출정하여 여진족 토벌과 고려군을 지원함으로써 이성계는 두각을 나타내기 시작하였다.
최영은 권문세족의 후예였다. 이성계와 비교되던 최영은 유서깊은 가문 출신으로 그 딸은 우왕의 왕비이다. 이성계가 신흥 무인세력의 대표라면 최영은 구세력의 대표라고 할 수 있었다. 한편 요동정벌 실패 후 그의 최후가 너무도 당당해서 뭇 사람들이 감동한 나머지 그의 시체가 버려진 곳을 지나는 사람마다 경의를 표했다고 한다. 또 최영의 의연한 죽음은 무력으로 권력을 장악한 이성계와 좋은 대조를 이루며 하나의 전설이 되었다. 하지만 당시에 조정의 신진사대부들은 충직한 최영을 선택하지 않고 신흥 무인세력인 이성계를 선택함으로써 이미 운명은 예고되어 있었다. 이인임 일파의 전횡에 백성과 신진사대부들은 치를 떨었고 정도전에 의한 정치개혁이 힘을 얻게 되었다.

주요 이력
본관은 경주이고, 초명은 최기남(崔奇男), 자(字)는 찬겸(贊謙), 아호(雅號)는 면암(勉庵)이다. 김기현과 이항로의 문하에서 수학하였으며, 노론 화서학파의 지도자이자 위정척사파의 중심 인물이었고, 흥선대원군의 월권행위를 비판하였다.
1855년 과거에 급제하여 관직에 올랐으며. 이후 여러 벼슬을 거쳐 동부승지, 참의, 돈녕부의 도정 등을 역임했고 안동 김씨 세도정치에 반대, 1863년 흥선대원군의 집권과 개혁 정책을 적극 지지했다. 그러나 1873년 음력 10월과 1874년 음력 11월, 이토록 두 차례씩 흥선대원군을 공격하여 끝내 실각시켰다. 그 뒤 의정부찬성 등을 역임하였다. 그는 고종 즉위 직후부터 나온 정도전, 남곤, 정인홍, 한효순, 윤휴, 이현일 등의 복권 여론을 친구 김평묵과 함께 여러 번 결사 반대하여 좌절시켰다.
1876년 강화도 조약 반대에서 가일층 부각되었다. 도끼를 메고 광화문에 나아가 올린 개항오불가(開港五不可)의 '병자척화소'(丙子斥和疏)를 올린 뒤부터는 개항 반대와 위정척사운동을 전개했고, 을사늑약 이후로는 항일 의병활동을 전개해 나갔다.
1905년 을사늑약 체결을 계기로 그는 공개적으로 의병을 모집하였다. 1906년 임병찬, 임락 등과 함께 전라북도 태인(泰仁)에서 거병하였으나, 곧 관군에게 패하여 체포되었고 대마도에 유배되었다. 유배 당일, 대마도주의 일본식 단발 요구에 대한 항의의 단식을 시작하였으나, 대마도주의 사과 및 왕명으로 단식을 중단을 하였다. 하지만, 3개월 뒤의 발병(풍증)과 단식 후유증으로 74세의 나이로 사망하였다. 그는 개화파를 반대하면서도, 흥선대원군의 월권행위와 남인, 북인 채용 정책에 적대적이었고, 고종의 황제 칭호 격상을 옳지 않게 여겼다. 사후 1928년 시호 없이 종묘 고종의 묘정에 배향되었다. 1962년 3월 1일 대한민국 건국공로훈장이 추서되었다.

생애
생애 초반
경기도 포천 출생으로, 화서 이항로의 제자이다. 1833년 12월 5일 경기도 포천군 내북면 가범리(嘉范里)에서 최대(崔岱)의 둘째 아들로 태어났다. 본관은 경주(慶州)이고 자는 찬겸(贊謙)이며 호는 면암(勉庵)이다. 타고난 자질이 뛰어나서 초명(初名)을 기남(奇男)이라고 하였다가 뒤에 익현으로 고쳤다. 최익현은 집안이 가난하여 4세때 단양(丹陽)으로 옮긴 것을 비롯하여 여러지방으로 옮겨다니며 살아야 했다. 14세때 부친의 명에 따라 성리학의 거두인 화서 이항로의 문인이 되어, 수학하였다.

수학과 소년기
14세 때 경기도 양근군 벽계(蘗溪)에 은퇴한 노론성리학의 거두 이항로의 문하에서 격몽요결, 대학장구(大學章句), 논어집주(論語集註) 등을 통해 성리학의 기본을 습득하였다. 이 과정에서 이항로의 '애군여부 우국여가(愛君如父 憂國如家)'의 정신, 즉 애국과 호국의 정신을 배웠다. 그는 이항로의 제자들 중에서도 수제자로 인정되었고, 나중에는 송시열과 송준길-권상하-한원진, 이간-이항로를 잇는 노론의 정통으로 간주되었다.
스승인 이항로로부터 우국애민(憂國愛民)적인 위정척사의 사상을 이어 받아 그것을 위국여가적(爲國如家的)인 충의사상과 존왕양이(尊王攘夷)의 춘추대의론으로 승화․발전시켜 자주적인 민족사상으로 체계화하였다. 23세 때에 명경과(明經科) 갑과(甲科)에 급제하여 관직생활을 시작하였으나 재임중 꾸준히 부정부패와 구국항일투쟁을 끊임없이 전개하였다. 그의 정치사상은 이항로 계열의 위정척사였으며 공맹(孔孟)의 왕도정치(王道政治) 구현을 이상으로 하였다.
화서는 최익현에게 '면암'(勉菴)이란 호를 지어 주고 '낙경민직'(洛敬민直)이란 글을 주면서 항상 학문을 권면하였다. 이로부터 최익현은 이항로의 학문을 전승받아 위정척사의 '구국부도'(救國扶道)의 의리를 구현시키고자 온 생애를 바쳤다. 이항로의 문하에서 그는 평생의 동지인 유인석, 김평묵 등을 만나게 된다. 1855년(철종 6년) 2월에 춘당대(春塘臺)에서 열린 강경(講經)에서 1등, 바로 생원시나 진사시를 거치지 않고도 그 해의 전시에 응시할 자격이 부여되었다.

관료 생활과 정치 활동
과거 급제와 관료 생활
철종 재위 중인 1855년(철종 6) 과거에 급제하여 승문원정자(承文院正字)를 시작으로 순강원수봉관(順康園守奉官)이 되었으며 이후 성균관과 사헌부, 사간원 등에서 근무했다. 성균관전적(成均館典籍), 사헌부지평(司憲府持平), 사간원정언, 이조정랑(吏曺正郞), 신창현감(新昌縣監) 등 내외직을 두루 거치면서 강직과 선정(善政)으로 칭송되었다. 지방관·언관으로 재직시 불의와 부정을 척결해 강직성을 발휘하였다.
그는 언관 벼슬에 주로 있으면서 일찌감치 조선조 사림의 최대 미덕인 강직한 성품을 드러냈다. 안동 김씨 세도정치에 반대하다가 눈밖에 나는가 하면 1864년 흥선대원군의 집권과 개혁 정책을 적극 지지했다. 그러나 흥선대원군이 세도 가문 축출에서 벗어나 노론을 견제하기 위해 남인, 북인 등도 등용하자 그에게 비판적인 시각을 견지하게 된다. 왕권 강화를 위해 경복궁을 중건하는 흥선대원군의 정책을 반대하여 관직을 빼앗기기도 했다.
그 뒤 다시 내직으로 돌아와 성균관직강이 되었다가 사헌부장령을 거쳐 공조참의, 돈녕부도정 등의 관직을 두루 역임하고 1868년 올린 상소에서 경복궁 재건을 위한 대원군의 비정을 비판, 시정을 건의하였다. 흥선대원군에 대한 상소는 그의 강직성과 그가 표방한 민본주의 성향 우국애민정신의 발로이며 막혔던 언로를 연 계기가 되었다. 1870년(고종 7)에 승전을 지냈다.

대원군 비판
스승인 이항로의 생존 시에 최익현은 스승 이항로가 대원군을 정치적으로 지지하였으므로 대원군에 대한 비판을 자제하였다. 그러나 이항로 사후에는 대원군에게 비판적으로 변하게 된다.
1868년(고종 5년) 경복궁 중건의 중지를 촉구하고, 부역에 동원되는 백성들의 생계 문제와 당백전 발행에 따르는 물가 인상과 재정의 파탄 등을 지적, 흥선대원군의 정책을 실정(失政)이라며 상소하였다. 그는 경복궁 중건의 대규모 공사에 많은 비용과 인력이 동원되어 인적, 물적 자원의 낭비가 심함을 들어 경복궁 중건을 반대하였다. 그해 사헌부장령에 제수되었으나 1868년 10월 다시 경복궁 중건을 무리한 토목공사라며 이를 중지할 것을 청하는 상소를 올렸다.
사간원사간 권종록이 이를 너무도 무례하다며 비판하였으나 오히려 고종은 그를 10월 20일을 기하여 돈녕부 도정(敦寧府 都正)으로 승진시켰다. 그러나 최익현은 10월 28일을 기한즉 직책 승진한지 8일만에 돈녕부 도정직을 사퇴한다. 그 뒤 흥선대원군이 서원철폐령을 내리자 대원군에 대해 더욱 적대적으로 변하였다. 1871년 상소를 올려 대원군의 만동묘(萬東廟)를 비롯한 서원들의 철폐는 존주대의와 면학분위기를 망치는 것이며 철폐령을 취소할 것을 건의하였다.

대원군 축출에 협력
한편 시아버지 흥선대원군을 축출하고자 한 명성황후는 사람을 보내 그와 교섭하였다. 흥선대원군의 서원철폐령이 받아들여지지 않자 1873년(고종 10년) 10월 돈녕부도정으로 재직 중 계유상소(癸酉上疏)를 올려 고종이 성년이며 대원군이 섭정을 할 이유가 없음을 상소하였다. 이 상소를 계기로 대원군의 10년 집권이 무너지고 고종의 친정이 시작되었다. 이때 그의 상소에 민씨 일족과 고종이 적극 지지하였다. 어려서 아버지의 도움으로 즉위한 고종이 성인이 되면서 흥선대원군의 그늘에서 벗어나려는 움직임이 일었고, 여기에는 부인인 명성황후와 여흥 민씨 척족 세력들이 가담했다. 대원군을 비판했던 최익현은 승정원동부승지로 기용되어 반 흥선대원군파의 첨병에 서게된다.
동부승지로 기용되면서 그는 이어 조정 대신들이 일처리를 잘못하여 번잡하다는 것을 지적, 상소한다. 이에 의정부좌의정 강노와 우의정 한계원, 영돈녕부사 홍순목 등이 사직 상소를 올렸고, 삼사에서는 최익현을 규탄하였다. 그러나 고종은 그의 상소를 높이 사서 일약 호조참판에 제수하였다. 그러나 상소문이 무례하다는 비난이 빗발쳤고 대원군계 인사들은 그를 규탄했다.
영의정 이유원 등과 함께 종실 흥선대원군 독점 전횡 체제 비판 작전에 전격 합세를 한 그는 서원을 철폐한 흥선대원군의 정책을 맹렬히 비판하는 등 대원군을 공격하여 결국 실각시켰다. 이후 고종의 신임을 받아 가선대부로 승진, 돈녕부도정을 거쳐 호조참판에 제수되었다. 그러나 그와 영상 이유원이 공동 시행한 흥선대원군 하야 운동은 부자이간의 행위라며 대원군 계열 인사로부터 비판받았다. 그는 임금의 아버지를 비판했다는 이유로 돈녕부도정에 전임되었다가 ＜사호조참판겸진소회소 辭戶曹參判兼陳所懷疏＞를 올려 민씨 일족의 옹폐를 비난하자 상소의 내용이 과격, 방자하다는 이유로 11월 의금부에서 국문을 한 뒤, 다시 제주도에 위리안치되는 형벌을 받았으나 이는 실권을 잡은 민씨 세력의 형식적인 처벌이었다.

윤휴, 이현일 복권 반대
1873년(고종 10) 이현일, 윤휴, 한효순, 목내선, 정인홍, 정도전 등을 복권해야 된다는 신원 상소가 올려졌다. 이에 최익현과 김평묵은 말도 안되는 소리라며 강하게 반발하였다. 그러나 정도전, 이현일, 윤휴 등을 복권해야 된다는 상소가 계속되자 최익현과 김평묵은 이를 막기 위해 줄기차게 노력하였다.
1873년(고종 10)부터 1876년까지 최익현과 김평묵 등은 상소 등을 통해 ""이현일, 한효순, 목내선 등의 신원을 요구한 사람들을 추율(追律, 반역죄)로 처단해야 하며, 남인인 윤휴 이후로 우리 서인(노론)과 남인은 원수가 됐다. 만약 서양과의 조약이 성립된 후에 민암, 목내선, 이인좌, 정희량, 이현일의 후손들이 백성의 불인(不忍)한 마음을 이용하여 창을 들고 도성과 대궐을 침범한다면 올바른 선비들이 일망타진될 것이다""라고 주창하여 이들의 복권 여론을 끝까지 반대하여 무산시켰다. 그 뒤에도 최익현과 김평묵은 남인과 이인좌의 난 관련자들의 복권을 결사 반대하였다. 결국 윤휴, 이현일 등은 김평묵과 최익현이 모두 죽은 뒤 1907년(융희 2년)에 가서야 복권된다.

개항, 개화 반대 운동
민씨 정권과의 갈등
최익현은 곧 외국과의 통상을 논의하기 시작한 민씨 정권과도 곧 마찰을 빚었다. 1876년 강화도조약 반대에서 가일층 부각되었다. 도끼를 메고 광화문에 나아가 개항을 해서는 안되는 다섯가지 이유를 적어 개항오불가(開港五不可)의 5조(條)로 된 '병자척화소'(丙子斥和疏)를 올렸다. 그는 그의 머리를 치고 가야 통상할 수 있다며 반대하였다. 척사소에서 그는 조약체결의 불가함을 역설하였다. 일제의 강압과 정부의 수교방침을 정면으로 반대하는 것으로 그 무렵 모든 개항반대상소 중에서도 가장 잘 지은 내용으로 손꼽힌다. 그러나 이 상소는 외면되었고, 그는 일본과의 통상 조약 체결을 극렬 반대하다가 이번에는 흑산도에 동성애자들과 4년간 위리안치된 것이다.
최익현이 반대한 개항 후의 사태는 개화, 주화파들의 주장과는 달리 근대문물을 앞세운 일제를 비롯한 열강의 침략으로 나타나 그의 예견은 적중한 것이었다. 특히 외국 자본의 침투와 경제적 진출은 농촌경제를 파탄으로 몰아갔고 그에 더하여 정치적, 군사적 침략이 강화되어 경향(京鄕)의 백성이 정부의 개화시책을 비판하는 속에서 위정척사의 배일운동이 정계의 주류를 이루게까지 되었다. 1879년 석방되어 고향으로 되돌아갔다.
이후로 통상 확대와 여러 외세의 유입이 계속되면서 최익현은 이에 결사 저항하는 위정척사론의 거두로 활동하게 된다.1894년 발생한 동학농민운동과 그해 친일 정권 성립과 함께 단행된 갑오개혁에 크게 반발했고, 이듬해 을미사변과 단발령을 계기로 의병을 조직했다가 체포되었다. 이 당시 그가 상소를 올리며 적은 “내 머리는 자를 수 있어도 머리카락은 자를 수 없다.”라는 말은 강제적 단발령에 목숨을 걸고 반발했던 당시 유학자들의 뜻을 함축한 표현이었다.

갑오경장 반대 운동
최익현은 계속 서구 문물의 유입을 나라를 타락시키는 원인으로 규정, 척사운동에 앞장서 국민의 자주의식을 고조시키고 외세의존세력을 규탄하여 마지 않았다. 1894년의 갑오경장이 단행되자 외세의 내정 간섭은 부당하다며 성토하였다. 이어 단발령이 시행되자 '청토역복의제소'(請討逆復衣制疏)를 올려 외세의 내정간섭이라며 규탄하였다. 갑오경장과 을미개혁에 반발하여 각지에서 의병이 궐기하자 그는 고종으로부터 갑오, 을미년의 의병항전에서는 각처에서 봉기한 의병을 해산시키라는 선유위원(宣諭委員)에 임명되었으나, 그는 도리어 '진회대죄소'(陳懷待罪疏)를 올려 의병들을 ""모두 충성과 의리를 앞세운 백성들""이라 일컬어 거의구국의 정당성을 밝혔다. 그리고 이들의 정당한 거병을 해산, 탄압할 이유가 없다며 항거하였다.
1895년 을미사변 때에도 각처에서 의병이 발생, 조정에서는 그에게 선유사의 직책을 내려 의병의 해산을 촉구하게 하였으나 해산 설득을 포기한다.

단발령 반대 운동
1895년 12월 30일(음력 11월 15일) 단발령이 시행되자 '신체발부는 수지부모요 불감훼상'이라는 이유로 단발령에 반대할 것을 호소하였다. 최익현은 유림 거두들과 연명하여 단발령은 야만적인 행태라며 규탄했다.
그러나 당시 내부대신 유길준 등은 단발령을 단행하였다. 1896년 초, 유생들의 단발 반대 상소가 빗발쳤다. 이에 유길준은 유생들의 시위의 배후로 최익현의 체포를 지시한다. 유길준은 유생들의 단발에 앞서, 유림들과의 몸싸움도 불사하고 최익현 체포를 위한 순검 1개 부대를 보냈다. 그는 단발령 반대 여론을 주도하던 최익현을 경기도 포천군 영평에서 체포하여 투옥시켰다. 이후 유길준은 유생들에 대한 단발을 감행하다. 유길준은 직접 최익현에게 고시문을 보이면서 법령대로 단발을 강행하겠다 하자, 최익현은 ""내 머리는 자를 수 있을지언정 머리털은 자를 수 없다.""고 질타하며 몸부림쳤다. 유길준은 가위를 들고 와서 최익현의 머리카락을 삭발하려 했다. 그러나 그가 완강하게 몸부림쳐서 유길준의 삭발 기도는 실패하고 만다.

독립협회, 만민공동회 비판
그는 독립협회, 만민공동회에 대해 정부의 대신들에게 부당한 압력을 행사할 가능성이 있다고 보았다. 어떤 무리들이 자신의 이익을 얻고자, 정부 관료에게 압력을 행사하거나 모함을 할 수 있다고 보았다. 그는 독립협회, 만민공동회를 민권당, 민권지당으로 규정하고 비판했다.
최익현은 1898년 12월 10일의 국내 현안에 대한 상소문 중 7번째 조항에 독립협회, 만민공동회 혁파를 건의했고, 이들을 변란을 조장하는 발판으로 규정했다. 최익현에 의하면 ''민당'을 혁파하여 변란의 발판을 막으소서. 신은 삼가 생각건대, 옛날에는 비방하는 것을 써놓는 나무와 진언(進言)할 때 치는 북이 있었으며, 조선본조(本朝)에 이르러서도 또한 유생들이 대궐문에 엎드리고 성균관(成均館) 유생들이 시위(示威)의 표시로 성균관을 비우고 나가버린 일이 있었으니, 진실로 백성들로 하여금 말을 하지 못하게 한 적은 없었습니다. 그러나 모두 한계가 있고 절제가 있어서, 차라리 정사에 대해 비방은 할지언정 대신을 협박해서 내쫓는 일은 없었으며, 차라리 소장을 올려 호소는 했을지언정 임금을 위협하는 일은 없었습니다.'라 하였다.
그는 독립협회, 만민공동회의 모임에 대해서도 '이른바 '민당'이라는 것은 시정(市井)의 무식한 무리들을 불러 모은 것으로서, 구차하게 패거리를 규합하고 임금에게 충성하고 나라를 사랑한다는 명분을 빌려서 대신(大臣)들을 멋대로 명하여 오라 가라 하고 임금을 지적하여 탓하며 나라의 정승을 능욕하였습니다. 밤낮으로 저들끼리 결탁하여 고함을 지르며 위엄을 보이고 생색을 내는 것이 굉장하여 그 기세가 무서울 정도입니다'라고 지적했다. 최익현은 집회가 폭력시위로 변질할 우려가 있다는 점도 같이 지적하였다.
그는 또 '더욱 심한 자 몇 사람을 다스리고 나머지는 법사(法司)로 하여금 해산시켜 보내도록 하며, 서둘러 정사와 형벌을 밝히고 교화를 힘껏 시행해서 백성들로 하여금 ‘임금이 과연 우리를 속이지 않고 진실한 마음과 실질적인 정사로 시종여일하는구나.’라고 분명히 알게 한다면, 무엇 때문에 백성들이 안정되지 않을까 근심하겠습니까'라 하였다. 최익현은 이권단체가 사사로이 이익을 챙기는데 정부 관리들에게 압력을 행사할 수 있다는 점과, 이권단체가 국민들의 눈과 귀를 가리고 속일수 있다고 보았다.
최익현은 1898년 12월 10일의 현안 상소의 7번째 조항에서, 고종에게 다른 이들을 시켜서 독립협회, 만민공동회를 해산할 것을 같이 진언한다. '지금 듣건대, 성상께서 분발하시고 큰 결단을 내리시어 모두 제거하신다고 하니, 진실로 더할 나위 없는 다행입니다. 그러나 그 뒤를 잘 처리하지 못하여 여러 사람의 마음을 복종시키지 못할까 두렵다'며 고종이 직접 독립협회, 만민공동회를 해산하지 말고, 다른 사람을 시켜서 악역으로 내세워 이들을 해산시킬 것을 강조했다.
백정 박성춘의 연설을 그는 못마땅히 여겨 패거리들의 작당으로 규정, 비판하였다.

대한제국 수립 이후
1898년(광무 1년) 궁내부특진관(宮內府特進官)에 제수되어 입궐하고, 이어 중추원의관(中樞院議官)을 거쳐 의정부찬정(贊政)이 되었다. 그해 경기도관찰사에 임명되었으나 사퇴하고 고향으로 내려가 후진교육에 진력하였다.
그는 학문 연구와 후학 양성을 통해 위정척사론의 전파를 추진했다. 세상이 혼란한 것은 인륜과 도덕이 땅에 떨어졌기 때문이라 굳게 확신하고 정론과 정학의 수호를 위해서 그는 교육의 중요성을 역설하였다. 그 뒤 러일전쟁의 발발과 일제의 군사적 국권침탈을 보고서는 '궐외대명소'(闕外待命疏)를 올려 외세의 척결과 국권수호의 방책을 역진하였다.
1904년 러일전쟁이 터지고 일본의 침략이 노골화되자 고종의 밀지를 받고 상경, 왕의 자문에 응하였고 일본으로부터의 차관(借款) 금지, 외국에 대한 의부심(倚附心) 금지 등을 상소하고, 한성부 거리에서 당시 내각 담당자들을 규탄, 이들의 파면과 처단을 강력히 요구하다가 두 차례나 일본 헌병들에 의해 향리로 압송당하였다.

을사늑약 반대 운동
1905년 을사늑약이 체결되었다. 그는 이를 늑약으로 간주, 반대 운동을 전개하였다. 최익현은 을사늑약의 늑결을 나라의 멸망으로 간주, 조약 체결 당사자 5명의 처단을 주장, '청토오적소'(請討五賊疏)와 '창의토적소'(倡義討賊疏)를 올려 불법 조약의 폐기, 취소와 의병항일전을 천명하였다. 또한 8도 사민(士民)에게 포고문을 발표하여 항일투쟁을 호소하였으며, 포고문과 신문을 통해 납세 거부, 철도 이용 안 하기, 일체의 일본상품 불매운동 등을 촉구하였다.
그러나 상소가 받아들여지지 않자 그는 충남 홍주의 유학자 민종식(閔宗植)이 구성한 의병진과 연대, 공동항쟁할 호남의병진의 편성으로 나타났다. 최익현은 1906년 1월에 충청남도 노성(魯城) 궐리사(闕里祠)에서 원근의 유림을 모아 강연을 열고 시국의 절박함을 알리며 일치 단결해서 국권회복에 동참해 줄 것을 촉구하였다. 이때의 모임에는 1896년 진주의병진에서 활약했던 경남 합천의 명유 애산(艾山) 정재규(鄭載圭)가 10여명의 지사들과 함께 참석하기도 하였다. 제천에서는 유인석 등도 거병하였다.
1906년 2월, 자신의 문하생이자 이미 독립하여 전북 태인의 종석산(鍾石山) 밑에 우거하며 후학을 양성하던 임병찬(林炳瓚)을 찾아가 구체적인 거사 계획을 수립하였다. 거사 장소는 태인의 무성서원(武城書院)으로 정한뒤, 최익현은 담양의 용추사(龍湫寺)로 내려가 기우만(奇宇萬), 이항선(李恒善), 장제세(張濟世), 조안국(趙安國) 등 호남의 명유지사 50여명을 소집, 이들과 회동하여 항전 방책을 논의하고 113명에 달하는 지사들의 연명부인 '동맹록(同盟錄)'을 작성하는 한편, 순천, 낙안(樂安), 흥양, 여수, 돌산, 광양, 장흥, 보성, 강진, 해남, 완도 등 호남 고을마다 격문을 보내 외세를 척결하고, 부패한 관료들을 처단할 목적으로 거병함을 밝히고 양심적인 지사들은 동참할 것을 촉구하였다. 한편 의병의 군율(軍律), 의복제도(衣服制度), 규칙(規則) 등을 작성하고, 임병찬이 주관이 되어 무기를 비롯한 각종 군비를 마련하였다.

의병 활동과 최후
의병 봉기
1905년 을사조약 체결을 계기로 그는 공개적으로 의병을 모집하였다. 임병찬, 임락 등과 함께 전라북도 정읍에서 거병하였으나, 곧 관군에게 패하여 체포되었고 대마도에 유배된다. 1906년 6월 4일 아침 최익현은 최제학(崔濟學), 고석진(高石鎭) 등 문인 수십명을 거느리고 무성서원에 도착, 강회를 연 뒤 거사를 일으켰다. 그때 그는 비통한 눈물을 흘리면서 사생을 맹세하였다.

1906년 6월 4일 최익현의 호남의병진이 무성서원에서 거의한 당일에 태인 본읍으로 진군한 뒤 향교에서 잠시 유진할 때에 발표된 최익현의 <기일본정부서(奇日本政府書)>를 발표하였다.

이어 그는 강화도 조약이 불법임을 선언하고, 강화도조약 체결 이래 조선에 대해 '기의배신'(棄義背信)한 일제의 죄상을 16가지로 나누어 조목조목 논술하여 한일 양국을 위해, 나아가서는 동양평화를 위해 일제의 각성을 촉구하였던 것이다.
그의 거병에 제자 문인들과 이날 모인 모든 회중(會衆)이 흔연히 사생을 맹세하니, 최익현은 죽음으로써 국가의 은혜를 갚을 것을 천명하였다. 그 즉시로 80여명이 대오를 편성한 뒤 태인 본읍을 향해 행군을 개시하였다.

의병 전쟁
1906년 6월 중순 최익현 의병진이 태인 본읍으로 진군해 오자, 군수 손병호(孫秉浩)는 저항은 엄두도 못내고 도망쳤다. 따라서 의병은 무혈로 태인을 점령하였고, 최익현은 향교로 들어가 명륜당에 좌정하고 향장(鄕長)과 수서기(首書記)를 불러 관아의 무기를 접수하는 한편, 군사들을 모아 의병진의 전력을 강화시켰다. 태인읍을 출발한 의병진은 30여리를 행군, 당일 하오 정읍에 당도하였다. 이어 정읍군 관군과 대결, 결국 정읍군수 송종면(宋鍾冕)의 항복을 받은 의병진은 이곳에서 소총 등의 무기류와 병력을 확보한 다음 다시 행군, 30여 리 떨어진 내장사(內藏寺)로 들어갔다. 이때 흥덕(興德) 선비 고석진(高石鎭)이 김재구(金在龜), 강종회(姜鍾會) 등과 함께 전투력이 뛰어난 포군 30여명을 거느리고 합류하였다.
이튿날 아침 내장사 뜰에서 좌, 우익을 갈라 잠시 군사를 조련한 다음 30여 리를 행군, 지세가 험해 천연의 요새를 이루고 있던 구암사(龜岩寺)로 들어가 다시 진영을 정비하였다. 구암사에서 그날 밤을 지낸 의병진은 다음날 첫새벽에 빗속을 행군, 정오경에 순창읍으로 들어갔다. 많은 주민들과 이속들이 나와 의병들을 환영하였으며, 군수 이건용(李建鎔)은 최익현 앞에 나아가 항복했다. 이를 전후해서 채영찬(蔡永贊), 황균창(黃均昌), 김갑술(金甲述), 양윤숙(楊允淑) 등이 인근 각지에서 포군을 거느리고 합류해와 의병진의 전력은 더욱 강화되었다.
최익현은 여기서 의병진을 재정비하고 부서를 정해 임병찬을 참모장으로 하고 김기술(金箕述), 유종규(柳鍾奎), 강종회(姜鍾會), 이동주(李東柱), 이용길(李容吉), 손종궁(孫鍾弓), 정시해(鄭時海) 등을 부장으로 각기 임명, 전열을 가다듬었다. 이때 전주경무고문지부(全州警務顧問支部) 소속 경찰대가 의병을 진압하기 위해 출동하기도 하였으나 의병은 산골짝에서 이들을 일거에 격퇴시켰다. 그 후 의병진은 그곳 순창에서 하룻밤을 지낸 뒤인 6월 8일 남원으로 진출코자 행군, 정오 무렵 50여 리 떨어진 곡성에 당도, 일제 관공서를 철거하고 세전(稅錢), 양곡 등을 접수하였다. 그곳 군수 송진옥(宋振玉) 역시 의병진을 영접하였고, 또 주민들도 적극 협조해 왔다. 그러나, 남원에는 이미 의병의 공격에 대비, 방어태세가 견고하여 후일을 기약하고 이튿날 의병진은 다시 순창으로 회군하였다. 의병에 합세하려는 삼방(三坊)포군 1백여명이 구암사와 백양사(白羊寺)에 주둔하고 있다는 전갈도 왔기 때문이다.
순창군수 이건용이, 의병진이 곡성으로 진출한 틈을 타 전라북도 관찰사 한진창(韓鎭昌)에게 지원 요청을 하여 의병 '토벌' 계획을 수립하였다. 그러나, 이러한 음모를 탐지한 최익현은 이건용을 의리로 타일러 오히려 그를 의병진에 가담토록 해서 전부장(前部長)으로 삼아 모병업무를 관장케 하였다.
이처럼 최익현 의병진은 거의 후 태인, 정읍, 순창, 곡성 등 호남 각지를 행군하면서 무기와 군사를 모아 거의 초기에 80여명에 지나지 않던 병력이 이때에 와서는 9백여명에 달했고, 그중 상당수가 소총 등의 화기를 소지하게 되어 전력이 크게 증강되었다. 그러나, 그보다도 중요한 점은 호남 일대가 최익현 의병의 활동 이후 의기로 가득차 의병진의 사기가 한층 고조되어 있었다는 사실이다.
6월 11일 아침, 광주관찰사 이도재(李道宰)는 의병해산을 명하는 광무황제의 선유조칙과 관찰사 고시문을 최익현에게 보내와 의병의 해산을 종용하였다. 그러나 최익현은 이를 단호히 거절하였다. 그러나 한국 통감부의 괴뢰로 전락한 정부에서는 전라북도관찰사 한진창에게 전북지방 진위대를 동원해 의병을 해산시키라는 훈령을 내렸다. 한진창은 전주와 남원의 진위대를 출동시켜 6월 11일 순창 외곽을 봉쇄하여 읍의 북쪽인 금산(錦山)에는 전주진위대가, 동쪽인 대동산(大同山)에는 남원진위대가 각각 포진하여 읍내 관아의 객관(客館)을 중심으로 포진하고 있던 의병진을 압박해 왔던 것이다.
최익현은 처음에 이들이 일본군인줄 알고 즉시 전투태세에 돌입했었다. 그러나 얼마뒤 척후병의 보고로 이들이 일군이 아니라 동족인 진위대 군사임을 알고는 동족상잔의 비극을 피하기 위해 진위대측에 다음과 같은 간곡한 통첩을 보냈다.

그러나 전주진위대와 남원진위대는 최익현의 이와 같은 호소를 묵살한 채 오히려 의병진의 피전(避戰)자세를 역이용해 일제히 공격을 가해 왔다. 의병측은 이미 '동포끼리는 싸워서는 안된다'고 사생취의(捨生取義)를 결행, 응전없는 상태에서 맹공을 받게 되자 중군장 정시해가 전사하는 등 일시에 진영이 와해되고 말았다. 최익현은 주위를 돌아보며 ""이곳이 내가 죽을 땅이다. 제군은 모두 떠나라""고 하며 지휘부가 있던 순창 객관 연청(椽廳)에 그대로 눌러 앉자, 그의 곁을 떠나지 않은 자가 22명이었다. 진위대는 의병측으로부터 아무런 저항이 없자 사격을 중지하고 지휘소를 에워싼채 그대로 밤을 지냈다.

단식과 최후
1906년 6월 13일 조정으로부터 궁내부특진관에서 해임되었다. 6월 14일 끝까지 남아 있던 최익현 이하 임병찬, 고석진, 김기술, 문달환(文達煥), 임현주(林顯周), 유종규, 조우식(趙愚植), 조영선(趙泳善), 최제학, 나기덕(羅基德), 이용길, 유해용(柳海瑢) 등 13인의 의사들은 전주로 압송되었다. 이로써 최익현의 의병항전은 종말을 고하였다.
6월 말 최익현은 이들과 함께 다시 경성부로 압송되어 경성 주재 일본군사령부에 감금당하였다. 최익현 이하 13인의 의병장들은 여기서 그들의 심문과 회유를 받는 동안에도 일본의 조선 식민지화 음모의 죄상을 성토하였다. 2개월간 일본군사령부에 감금된 끝에 최익현과 임병찬은 그해 8월 하순 일본의 쓰시마섬 엄원(嚴原) 위수영(衛戍營)으로 압송되어 감금되었다. 그곳에는 홍주의병진의 유준근(柳濬根), 이식(李식) 등 의병 9인이 이미 함께 감금되어 있었다.
최익현은 일본 정부 측의 갖은 협박과 회유를 뿌리치고 단식에 돌입하였다. 최익현은 죽음이 임박해지자 임병찬에게《유소(遺疏)》를 구술, 다음과 같은 여한(餘恨)을 남겼다.

일본인들은 강제로 그의 입에 음식을 넣었으나 모두 뱉거나 입을 열지 않고 저항하였다. 1906년 10월경 그는 풍증이 발병하였다. 1907년 1월 1일 쓰시마섬 감옥에서 풍증과 단식 후유증으로 사망하였다.

시신의 운구와 장례식
최익현의 유해는 1월 5일 쓰시마에서 배편으로 경상남도 동래부 초량(草梁)에 닿았다. '춘추대의 일월고충'(春秋大義 日月孤忠) 8자의 만장(輓章)을 앞세운 그의 영구(靈柩)는 연도에 수많은 인파가 늘어서 애도하는 가운데 구포, 성주, 황간, 공주 등지를 거쳐 1월 20일 청양의 본가에 도착, 무동산(舞童山) 기슭에 묻혔다. 1907년 논산군 상월면의 국도변에 안장했다가 뒤에 예산군 관음리로 이장했다. 문집으로는 《면암집》, 면암속집 등이 있다.

사후
묘소 《최익현선생묘》는 충청남도 예산군 광시면 관음리에 있다. 1982년 8월 3일 충청남도의 기념물 제29호로 지정되었다.
최익현의 춘추대의비(春秋大義碑)는 조선총독부에 의해 땅에 묻혔다가 해방 후 충청남도 예산군 광시면 관음리 소재 묘소에 다시 세워졌다.
시호 없이 1928년 이왕직에 의해 종묘 고종의 묘정에 배향되었다. 그러나 시호가 없다는 점이 문제가 되어 논란이 있었다. 그러나 종묘에서 출향되지는 않았다.
대한민국 정부는 그의 공훈을 기려 1962년 3월 1일 건국훈장 대한민국장을 추서하였다.

사상과 신념
최익현의 위정척사론은 어디까지나 성리학을 바탕으로 하고 중화사상의 테두리 속에 머물러 있어 중국으로부터의 완전 이탈이나 성리학적 윤리질서의 개조란 용납될 수 없었다. 그러므로 그에게는 개화된 일본도, 금수시(禽獸視)하는 서구 각국과 다를 바 없었으며, 또한 그는 동학 농민 운동의 농민군과 동학도들을 도적이라 비판하였다. 그에 의하면 전통적 왕조 질서를 뒤흔들려는 동학(東學)도 '동비'(東匪)로밖에 간주되지 않았다.
고종 즉위 직후부터 나온 정도전, 남곤, 정인홍, 한효순, 윤휴, 이현일 등의 복권 여론이 나오면, 동문이자 친구 김평묵과 함께 번번히 결사 반대하여 좌절시켰다. 이들은 그가 죽은 직후인 1907년(융희 1) 순종 즉위 후 복권되었다.
또한 그는 대한제국의 수립을 반대하였다. 조선의 국왕이 대한제국(大韓帝國)의 '황제'(皇帝)로 격상되는 것을 옳게 여기지도 않았다.

평등사회를 반대한 이유
최익현은 평등 사상에 대해 반대하였다. 그가 평등사회를 반대한 이유는 부와 권력, 사회적 지위를 위해 서로 적나라하게 경쟁하는 천박한 평등사회가 될 가능성이 높다고 전망했다. 최익현은 보통 사람들이 모든 것을 차지하고 또 한국이 점차적으로 부, 권력, 사회적 지위를 위해 서로 적나라하게 경쟁하는 천박한 평등사회로 향해가고 있다는데 대해 깊은 우려를 나타내고 있었다.

의회 설치와 민권당 반대 이유
그는 독립협회를 민권당으로 보았다. 그가 민권당을 반대하는 이유로는 국회나 의회에서 민권당, 민권운동을 하는 무리들이 정부 고위층, 관료에게 압력을 주어, 자신들의 사사로운 이익을 챙길 것으로 내다보았다. 그가 국회, 의회를 반대하는 이유는 이런 특정한 무리들이 정부 관료들에게 압력을 행사하는 것을 그 이유로 들었다. 최익현은 '본인은 외국에는 소위 자유의원(自由議員)과 국민의 권리를 위한 민권당(民權黨) 또는 민권지당(民權之黨) 이 있으며, 국민이 그들의 지도자를 자발적으로 선출하는 실례가 있다고 들었다. 이들 정당원(黨人)들이 이미 그들의 정부 대신(大臣)들을 되풀이해서 협박하고 축출해낸 일이 여러번 있었은즉, 그들은 목적달성을 위해 그 어떤 일을 망설이겠는가? 이들 추종자들이 나라에 대한 진정한 충성심과 조국애를 지니고 있다고 가정할지라도 그들을 도리(道理) 로 생각할 때에 우리들은 그들이 자기네의 계획들을 지속하게끔 방치할 수 없다. '고 하였다.
최익현은 특정 세력이나 개인이 정부의 고위층에게 압력을 행사하거나 이권을 요구하거나 할 것을 내다보았다. 최익현은 '더군다나 그들은 아무렇게나 모여든 새들의 무리와 같고, 기율(紀律)없는 폭도들과 같다. 그들이 어떻게 국가를 통치하는 올바른 길을 알 수 있겠는가, 알고 있다고 하더라도, 협박한 그들의 죄는 어떻게 용서받을 수가 있겠는가?'라고 지적했다. 그는 이런 이권청탁이나 요구를 일종의 협박으로 보았다.
독립협회에 대해서는 상소문에 시정(市井)의 무식한 무리들을 불러 모은 것으로서, 구차하게 패거리를 규합하고 임금에게 충성하고 나라를 사랑한다는 명분을 빌려서 대신(大臣)들을 멋대로 명하여 오라 가라 하고 임금을 지적하여 탓하며 나라의 정승을 능욕한다고 비판하기도 했다. 백정 박성춘의 연설이 있자 패거리들의 작당이라며 이를 비판하였다.

대원군 월권행위 비판
그는 흥선대원군을 월권행위자로 보았다. 그가 흥선대원군을 부정적으로 본 이유는 서원철폐보다는 남인과 북인 당원을 채용하는 것이었다.
국왕의 생부로 집권해온 대원군의 강력정치와 월권행위를 비판, 대원군이 남인과 북인을 등용하는 것 역시 정사를 어지럽히는 행위라 보고 대원군 집권 명분의 정당성이 없음을 들어 탄핵, 실각시켰다. 이때 '봉명조양'(鳳鳴朝陽)이란 찬사를 받게 되었다. 그러나 그도 대원군 세력의 공격으로부터 보호하기 위해 한직으로 전임되었지만 한때 '왕실의 골육을 이간시킨' 죄목으로 2년간 제주도에 위리안치(圍籬安置)되기도 하였다.

단발령 반대
그는 갑오개혁과 단발령 당시 나라가 망하는 것이라며 저항하였다. '5백년 종사가 드디어 망하니 어찌 한번 싸우지 않겠는가' 또한 '살아서 원수의 노예가 되는 것이 어찌 충의(忠義)의 혼이 되는 것만 같겠는가'라며 갑오경장 등에 저항한다. 또한 단발령 당시 그는 '두가단(頭可斷)이나 발불가단(髮不可斷)'이라는 어록을 남기기도 했다.

농민군 출신에 대한 반감과 의심
의병활동을 하면서 최익현을 포함한 유생들은, 유생들과 농민들 사이의 협력에 대한 요구가 컸음에도 불구하고, 농민들에게 가졌던 적개심과 공포가 뒤섞인 업신여겨 보는 태도를 전혀 극복할 수 없었다. 최익현은 농민 출신들의 잔인함과 호전성, 살인, 도둑질, 무례함을 극도로 혐오하였다. 정재식은 이를 두고 '최익현은 '살인적이고 도둑질을 자행하는 농민 무리들 을 반대하며'라는 격렬한 글에서 보인, 16세기 독일의 ""위험하고, 해로우며, 극악무도한 농민반란자들을"" 남모르게 혹은 공공연하게 치고, 죽이고, 찌르라"" 주장한 마틴 루터(Martin Luther)가 보였던 감정적인 반응과 비슷한 반응'이라 평하기도 했다.

기타
그는 그의 스승 이항로의 도덕적 원리를 실현하고자 하는 단호한 면모가 있었다.

생애
출생설
《삼국사기》에 수록된 석탈해 설화에 따르면 본래는 다파나국(多婆那國)출신으로, 그 나라 왕이 여국(女國) 왕녀를 아내로 맞이했는데 임신 7년 만에 큰 알을 낳았다. 왕은 사람이 알을 낳는 일은 상서롭지 못한 일이니 알을 버릴 것을 명했고, 왕비는 비단으로 알과 보물을 싸 궤 속에 넣어 바다에 떠내보냈다. 가락국의 바닷가에 닿았으나 가야인들은 이를 괴이하게 여겨 건지지 않았고, 진한의 아진포(阿珍浦) 어구에 이르니 이 때가 박혁거세 거서간의 즉위 39년, 곧 기원전 19년이라 하는데, 삼국사기의 이 기록은 탈해가 왕위에 오른 57년에 그가 62세, 기원전 5년이었다는 같은 책의 기록과 모순된다. 또한, 가야의 역사를 다룬 《삼국유사》〈가락국기〉에는 용성국(龍城國) 출신인 탈해가 가야에 먼저 도래하여 김수로왕과 왕위를 놓고 다투다 패배하였다는 기록이 전한다. 왜국의 동북쪽으로 1천리 먼곳에서 왔다고 하며 북방 신화가 강하게 보이는 것을 보아 현재 함경도, 연해주 또는 우산국(울릉도)출신이라는 추측 설과 캄차카 반도 또는 인도에서 왔다는 추측 설 그리고 자신을 신성시하기 위해 동해 북쪽 멀리에서 왔다고 하며 용궁 전설을 사용했다는 설이 있다. 일본 역사에 기록된 도이의 입구에서 보이듯이 고려인과 여진족 해적이 일본 큐슈 지방을 침략한 일이 있었기 때문에 고구려가 오랫동안 점령하고 있던 연해주와 중국 동북 지방의 부족들이 배를 타고 한반도 남부에 나타났다고 보기도 한다. 그때 당시 왜국은 고고학적인 발굴에 의해 큐슈(九州)북부 에 있다고 보는데 그 큐슈 북부에 있는 왜국의 동북쪽으로 1천리가 연해주의 우수리강이 있기 때문이다.
석탈해의 출신지인 다파나국과 삼국유사에 기록된 용성국은 정확히 어디인지 알려져 있지 않다. 다만 학자들은 석탈해가 동해를 거쳐 토함산으로 오면서 철기라는 새로운 문명을 들고 왔다는 점에는 동의하고 있다. 한편, 인도 타밀인으로서 촐라국 출신이라는 주장도 있는데 다파나는 산스크리트어와 고대 타밀어로 태양을 뜻하는 타파나(Tapana)로 보고 허황옥 신화처럼 중앙아시아의 유목민족이 인도 불교를 실크로드를 통해 동아시아의 한반도에 전파한 것을 신화로 나타냈다는 설이 있다.

치세
24년, 남해 차차웅이 죽자 유리가 마땅히 왕위에 올라야 했는데, 대보(大輔)인 탈해가 본래 덕망이 있었던 까닭에 왕위를 미루어 사양하였다. 57년, 유리 이사금의 유언에 따라 왕이 되었다. 즉위 이듬해인 58년 봄 정월에 호공을 대보(大輔)로 삼았고 음력 2월에 몸소 시조묘에 제사지냈다. 탈해 이사금은 즉위 초에 외교에 힘을 기울여 59년 왜와 수교하였으며, 61년 마한의 장수 맹소(孟召)가 복암성(覆巖城)을 바치고 항복했다.
그러나 탈해 이사금 대에 신라와 백제는 계속 전시 상태였는데, 63년 음력 10월 백제의 다루왕이 낭자곡성(娘子谷城)까지 땅을 개척하고 만날 것을 제안했으나 거부했다. 64년 음력 8월에는 백제가 와산성(蛙山城)을, 음력 10월에 구양성(狗壤城)을 공격했으나 기병 2천명을 내어 쫓았다. 65년 시림(始林)에서 김알지(金閼智)를 얻고 시림을 계림으로 개칭한 뒤 계림을 국호로 삼았다.
66년, 백제는 다시 와산성을 빼앗고 수비병 2백을 주둔시켰으나 신라는 곧 다시 빼앗았다. 67년 봄 정월에 박씨의 귀척(貴戚)으로써 나라 안의 주·군(州郡)을 나누어 다스리게 했는데, 이름을 주주(州主)·군주(郡主)라 하였다. 음력 2월에 순정(順貞)을 이벌찬으로 삼아 정치의 일을 맡겼다. 70년에 다시금 백제의 침공이 있었으나 자세한 것은 전하지 않는다. 73년에는 왜인이 목출도(木出島)를 침범해 각간(角干) 우오(羽烏)를 보내 막았으나 이기지 못하고 우오는 전사하였다. 74년에는 백제군이 변방을 노략, 탈해가 병사를 보내 격퇴했다. 75년 크게 가물어 백성이 굶주렸으므로 창고를 열어 곡식을 나누어 주어서 진휼하였다. 음력 10월 백제가 와산성을 다시 공격, 함락되었으나 이듬해 음력 9월 회복하고 백제인 2백 명을 모두 죽였다.
이와 같이 탈해 이사금 치세 때, 신라와 백제가 서로 2백 명 정도의 적은 군사로 연혁(沿革)도 전하지 않는 와산(蛙山) 봉산(烽山) 등지를 거의 해마다 빼앗고 빼앗기곤 하였다는 것이 삼국사기의 기록이나, 신라는 당초 경주 한 귀퉁이의 조그만 나라이고, 백제는 온조왕(溫祚王) 당년에 벌써 마한(馬韓) 50여 나라를 차지하였으니 신라와 똑같이 해마다 2백 명정도의 군사를 내었다는 것에 의문이 있다. 또한, 두 나라가 간혹 화호(和好)한 일이 있으나 삼국사기에는 늘 백제가 먼저 신라에 향하여 화의를 빌었다고 하였는데, 백제가 신라보다 몇 갑절 되는 큰 나라로서 늘 먼저 굴복하였다는 것도 의문이다. 백제와 신라 사이에 가라(加羅) 6나라와 사벌(沙伐)·감문(甘文) 등 완충국(緩衝國)이 있었는데 백제가 가라 등의 나라들과는 한 번의 충돌도 기록이 없고 도리어 신라를 침범했다는 것도 의문이다. 대개 신라가 백제를 원망함이 심하였으므로 신라는 백제가 망한 뒤에 그와 관계된 사적을 많이 고치거나 혹은 위조하였다. 중국의 《삼국지》(三國志)·《남사》(南史)·《북사》(北史) 등에 보인 기록을 보면 신라가 처음에 백제의 결제를 받았다 하였으니 이것이 도리어 믿을 만한 기록일 것이라는 것이 신채호의 주장이다.
77년 음력 8월에 아찬 길문(吉門)이 황산진(黃山津) 어구에서 가야군과 싸워 1천 기를 베었다고 하나, 공격전이었는지 방어전이었는지는 알 수 없다.
79년에는 장군 거도를 파견하여 현재의 울산 울주구, 부산 동래구에 해당하는 우시산국(于尸山國)과 거칠산국(居柒山國)을 병합하였다.
80년 가을 음력 8월에 죽어 성 북쪽의 양정구(壤井丘)에 장사지냈다. 후에 뼈를 새로 수습했는데 머리의 둘레는 3척 2촌이고 몸 뼈의 길이는 9척 7촌이었다. 이 뼈들을 부수어서 소상으로 만든 뒤 동악에 안치한 후 그곳에 모셨다고 한다.

사후
그를 모시는 숭신전(崇信殿)이 세워졌으며 1980년 경주시 남쪽 탈해왕릉 앞으로 옮겨졌다. 사후 9대 왕 벌휴 이사금이 즉위하였으나 연대차이가 심하여 그의 손자 여부는 불확실하다.

탄생 신화
탈해 이사금은 신라 제4대 왕으로 시림(始林)을 계림(鷄林)이라 개칭하여 국호로 정하고 주주(州主), 군주(郡主) 등의 관직을 새로 만들었다. 황산진에서 가야와 싸워 크게 이겼다. 원래의 칭호는 탈해이사금(脫解尼師今)이다. 성은 석(昔)이다. 용성국(龍城國)의 왕과 적녀국(積女國)의 왕녀 사이에 태어난 알이 궤짝에 담겨 표류하다가 BC 19년(박혁거세 39) 아진포(阿珍浦, 현재 영일(迎日) 지역)에서 고기잡이 할머니 아진의선이 발견, 기른 것이 후에 탈해왕이 되었다는 설화가 전한다.
8년(남해왕 5) 왕의 사위가 되고 10년 대보(大輔)에 올라 군국정사(軍國政事)를 맡아 보았다. 57년 유리왕이 죽자 선왕(先王) 남해왕의 유언에 따라 왕위에 올랐다. 즉위 후 백제를 자주 공격했으며, 일본과는 화친했다. 65년 시림(始林)에서 김알지(金閼智)를 얻어 시림을 계림(鷄林)이라 개칭하여 국호로 정하고 주(州)에 주주(州主), 군(郡)에 군주(郡主) 등의 관직을 새로 만들었다. 77년 황산진(黃山津)에서 가야(伽耶)와 싸워 크게 이겼다. 능은 양정(壤井, 경주 북쪽)에 있다.

생애
출생에서 즉위까지
출생
603년에 출생했다. 아버지는 진지왕(眞智王)의 아들 김용춘, 어머니는 진평왕의 딸이었던 천명부인이다. 그가 사료에 '진골'로 기재된 것에 대해서는 할아버지인 진지왕이 재위 4년 만에 국인에 의해 폐위당한 점이나 김춘추 자신이 진골이자 옛 금관가야의 왕족 출신인 김유신(金庾信)의 누이인 문희를 아내로 삼은 점 등이 이유로 지적되고 있다.

김유신과의 혼인 동맹
김춘추와 문희의 혼인에 대해 《삼국유사》는 다음과 같은 이야기를 전하고 있다. 김유신의 누이동생인 보희가 어느 날 서악(西岳)에 올라가 소변을 보았는데 서라벌 전역이 소변에 모두 잠겨버렸다는 꿈을 꾸었는데, 그 꿈 이야기를 들은 문희는 비단치마를 주고 그 꿈을 샀다. 그 일이 있고 열흘 뒤인 정월 오기일에 김춘추는 김유신과 함께 김유신의 집 앞에서 축국을 하게 되었고, 여기서 김유신은 일부러 김춘추의 옷깃을 밟아 끊은 뒤 자신의 집에서 옷을 수선할 것을 권하며 집안으로 들이고, 자신의 누이동생을 불러 옷을 꿰매게 했다. 보희는 ""사소한 일로 귀한 분을 대할 수는 없다""며 사양했고, 문희가 대신 나서서 옷을 꿰매 주었다. 이 일로 두 사람은 가까워져서 김춘추는 김유신의 집을 자주 드나들게 되었는데, 좀처럼 김춘추가 문희와 정식으로 혼인하려 하지 않자 김유신은 ""남편도 없는 것이 부모도 모르게 임신을 하였다""며 곧 문희를 자신이 불태워 죽일 것이라고 소문을 냈고, 선덕여왕(善德女王)이 남산(南山)에 오르는 날을 기다려서 뜰에 땔나무를 쌓아 놓고 불을 질러 연기를 피웠다. 산 위에서 그 연기를 발견한 여왕이 ""저것은 무슨 연기인가?"" 하고 묻자 옆에서 ""아마도 유신이 제 누이를 불태우려는 모양입니다.""라고 대답했고, 까닭을 묻는 여왕에게 ""남편도 없이 임신하였기 때문입니다.""라고 대답했다. 여왕이 ""대체 누가 그런 짓을 했단 말인가?""고 묻는 옆에서, 마침 여왕을 따라 나왔다가 안색이 질린 김춘추를 발견한 여왕은 ""너의 짓이구나. 당장 가서 구하라."" 하였다. 이후 김춘추는 문희와 혼례를 올리게 되었다.

구 귀족 집단의 견제를 벗어난 왕권의 강화
김유신의 주도와 김춘추의 동조로 이루어진 정략적인 측면이 강했던 이 혼인을 통해, 왕위 계승에서 배제된 진지왕계와 옛 금관가야계 귀족간에 정치 · 군사적 결합이 이루어졌다는 평가를 받고 있다. 진지왕계(김용춘 · 김춘추)는 김유신계의 군사적 능력을, 금관가야계(김서현 · 김유신)는 진지왕계의 정치적 위치를 각자의 목적 달성을 위해 필수적인 것으로 여기고 있었고, 이러한 상호 이익에 입각해 이루어진 정치적 결탁은 신라의 중고(中古) 왕실의 진골 귀족 내에서 하나의 신집단을 형성하게 되어 성골(聖骨)계로 대표되는 기존의 구 귀족집단의 견제와 반발을 받았다. 무열왕은 부계가 진지왕의 자손이고 모계가 진평왕의 자손으로 양쪽 모두가 왕족인 성골에 속했지만, 무열왕 이후 부계만이 왕족인 진골이 왕위를 계승하게 되었고 그를 상징적인 진골 최초의 임금으로 평가한다.

외교 활동
선덕여왕 11년(642년) 8월, 백제(百濟)의 장군 윤충(允忠)이 신라의 대야성(大耶城, 경상남도 합천)을 공격하여 함락시켰다. 대야성의 성주였던 이찬 김품석은 김춘추의 딸 고타소(古陀炤)의 남편으로 김춘추의 사위였는데, 앞서 그에게 아내를 빼앗긴 원한으로 백제군과 내통한 부하 검일(黔日)의 배반으로 궁지에 몰린 김품석은 처자를 죽인 뒤 자신도 목숨을 끊었다. 《삼국사기》는 당시 김춘추는 이찬의 관등에 올라 있었고, 대야성에서 딸과 사위가 죽었다는 소식이 전해지자 충격을 받은 나머지, 하루 종일 기둥에 기대어 사람이 지나가는 것도 알지 못할 정도였다고 적고 있다. 그리고 대야성의 일을 계기로 백제를 멸망시키겠다고 다짐하였다는 것이다. 원병을 빌리기 위해 고구려에 사신으로 갈 것을 왕에게 건의한 김춘추는 고구려의 국왕 보장왕과 실권자 연개소문을 만나 원병을 청했지만, 원병 파병 조건으로 과거 진흥왕(眞興王) 때에 신라가 획득한 죽령(竹嶺) 이북 땅의 반환을 내세운 고구려에 의해 억류되었다가 김유신의 무력 시위, 그리고 고구려 대신 선도해의 도움으로 ""돌아가는 대로 왕에게 아뢰어 땅을 돌려주게 하겠다""는 거짓 편지를 쓰고 나서야 풀려날 수 있었다.
고구려 뿐만 아니라 《일본서기》에는 고토쿠 천황(孝德天皇) 다이카(大化) 3년(647년)에 김춘추가 왜에 왔었다는 기록이 있는데, 이때 김춘추의 관등은 상신(上臣) 대아찬(大阿湌)으로 표기되어 있다. 한편 신라에서는 상대등 비담이 일으킨 반란이 김유신에 의해 진압되고, 선덕여왕의 사망으로 진덕여왕이 옹립되었다. 춘추와 유신은 진덕여왕을 보위하여 정권을 완벽하게 장악하였다.
이듬해인 648년 12월에 김춘추는 드디어 아들 문왕(文王)과 함께 직접 당(唐)에 입조하였고 태종(太宗)의 환대를 받았다. 김춘추는 이곳에서 당의 국학(國學)을 방문하여 석전(釋奠)과 강론(講論)을 참관하였으며, 신라의 장복(章服)을 고쳐서 중국의 제도에 따를 것을 청했다. 당 태종으로부터 특진(特進)의 벼슬을 받고, 당에 체류하던 중에 태종의 호출로 사적으로 불려가 만나게 된 자리에서 김춘추는 ""신(臣)의 나라는 바다 모퉁이에 치우쳐 있으면서도 천조(天朝)를 섬긴 지 이미 여러 해가 되었사온데, 백제가 강하고 교활하여 여러 차례 침략해 왔습니다. 더욱이 지난해에는 군사를 크게 일으켜 깊숙이 쳐들어와 수십 개의 성을 쳐서 함락시키고 조회할 길을 막았습니다. 폐하께서 천병(天兵)을 빌려주시어 흉악한 것을 잘라 없애주시지 못한다면, 우리 나라의 인민은 모두 사로잡히는 바가 될 것이요, 산 넘고 바다 건너 행하는 조공마저 다시는 바랄 수 없을 것입니다.""라며 태종에게 원병 파병을 호소해, 태종의 허락을 받아냈다.
귀국하는 김춘추에게 당 태종은 3품 이상의 관인들을 불러 송별연을 열었고, 『온탕비(溫湯碑)』 · 『진사비(晉祠碑)』의 글과 《진서(晉書)》 한 질을 김춘추에게 하사하였으며 장안성(長安城)의 동문(東門) 밖까지 나아가 전송하였다. 앞의 서적들은 태종 자신이 직접 짓고 글씨도 쓴 것으로, 특히 《진서》는 당의 비서감(秘書監)에서 맨 먼저 필사한 두 질 가운데 하나로서 태자(훗날의 당 고종)와 김춘추에게 각각 내린 것이었다. 김춘추도 당으로부터 좌무위장군(左武衛將軍)의 벼슬을 받은 아들 문왕을 숙위(宿衛)로서 당에 남겨두고 신라로 귀국하였다. 돌아오는 길에 김춘추는 서해상에서 고구려 순라병에게 포착되어 나포될 위기에 처했으나, 함께 왔던 온군해(溫君解)가 귀인의 관을 쓰고 배에 남아 고구려군의 주의를 끄는 사이 작은 배를 타고 본국으로 돌아올 수 있었다.
김춘추가 귀국한 태화 3년(649년)부터 신라는 관복을 당풍으로 바꾸고, 태화 4년(650년) 진덕여왕이 직접 당의 왕업을 찬미하는 「오언태평송(五言太平頌)」을 지어 비단에 수를 놓아 보냈으며, 신라의 고유 연호를 폐지하고 당의 영휘(永徽) 연호를 쓰는 등 친당 정책을 더욱 가속화하였다. 진덕여왕 5년(651년)에는 중국의 제도를 본뜬 정월 초하루일 백관(百官)들이 모여 행하는 하정례(賀正禮)를 처음으로 조원전(朝元殿)에서 치렀으며, 품주(稟主)가 집사부(執事部)로 개편되어 왕정의 기밀 사무를 맡았다. 좌이방부(左理方府)가 설치되고, 파진찬(波珍湌) 김인문(金仁問)이 다시 당에 파견되어 좌령군위장군(左領軍衛將軍) 벼슬을 받고 숙위를 맡았다.

재위
즉위
진덕여왕 8년(654년) 3월에 진덕여왕이 승하하고, 진골 세력은 상대등 알천(閼川)에게 섭정을 청하였으나 알천은 이를 사양하고 춘추에게 왕위에 오를 것을 권하였다. 춘추는 사양하다가 마침내 국인의 천거를 받아들여 임금으로 즉위하였다. 《삼국사기》는 신라의 시조(始祖) 혁거세(赫居世)부터 진덕여왕까지의 28명의 임금을 성골, 무열왕부터 마지막 경순왕(敬順王)까지를 진골이라고 하였으며, 무열왕부터 혜공왕에 이르는 8명의 임금이 재위한 시기를 중대(中代)로 분류하였다. 한편 《삼국유사》는 진덕여왕 이후 무열왕부터의 왕계를 하고(下古)로 분류하고 있다.
즉위 직후 무열왕은 아버지 김용춘을 문흥왕(文興王)으로, 어머니 천명공주를 문정태후(文貞太后)로 추봉하여 왕권의 정통성을 확립하였으며, 5월에는 이방부령(理方府令) 양수(良首) 등에게 이방부격(理方府格) 60여 조를 제정하게 하였다. 무열왕 2년(655년)에는 문희 소생의 맏아들 법민(法敏)을 태자로 삼고, 나머지 문희 소생의 왕자들에게도 관등을 수여하였다. 대각찬(大角湌) 김유신에게는 딸 지소공주를 시집보내 중첩된 혼인관계를 이루었다.
당에도 즉위를 알리는 사신을 파견하여, 무열왕 즉위년에 고종(高宗)으로부터 개부의동삼사(開府儀同三司)·신라왕의 책봉을 받았으며, 무열왕 2년(655년)에 당에 사신을 보내어, 고구려가 백제와 말갈과 더불어 신라의 북쪽 변경의 33개 성을 탈취하였음을 전하면서 구원을 요청하였고, 당은 3월, 영주도독(營州都督) 정명진(程名振)과 좌우위중랑장(左右衛中郞將) 소정방(蘇定方)을 보내어 고구려를 공격하였다. 또한 무열왕 3년(656년)에는 신라의 개국 공신인 사로 6촌장을 왕으로 추존하였고, 당에서 귀국한 김인문을 군주(軍主)로 삼았으며, 가을 7월에는 김문왕을 다시 당에 보내 조공하게 하였다. 귀국한 뒤 문왕은 무열왕 5년(658년) 정월에 부왕으로부터 집사부의 중시(中侍)로 임명되고, 김인문도 무열왕 6년(659년) 여름 4월에 백제를 치기 위한 원병 파병을 요청하는 사신으로서 당에 파견되는 등, 친족 중심의 내각을 구성하여 왕권을 안정시켰다. 즉위에 절대적으로 기여한 김유신에 대해서는 무열왕 7년(660년) 정월에 상대등(上大等)으로 임명해 왕권을 보다 전제화할 수 있는 계기를 만들었다.
무열왕이 즉위하기 전의 상대등은 귀족들의 모임인 화백 회의의 대표자로서 왕권을 견제하는 존재이거나 왕위계승 경쟁자로서의 자격이 있었다. 그러나 무열왕 이후 상대등을 왕이 임명함으로써 화백 회의는 혜공왕 이전까지 왕권 아래에 위치해 있었다. 이러한 왕권을 바탕으로 무열왕은 고구려 및 백제와 본격적인 전쟁에 참여하였다.

백제 정복
무열왕 7년(660년) 3월, 신라의 요청을 받아들인 당은 좌무위대장군(左武衛大將軍) 신구도행군대총관(神丘道行軍大摠管) 소정방과 좌효위장군(左驍衛將軍) 유백영(劉伯英) 등이 인솔한 수륙 130,000명의 군사를 파병하였다. 원병을 요청하러 보낸 김인문은 소정방이 이끄는 신구도행군의 부대총관(副大摠管) 자격으로 귀국하였고, 무열왕에게도 우이도행군총관(嵎夷道行軍總管)이라는 지위가 더해졌다. 무열왕은 바다를 건너온 당군을 영접하기 위해 5월 26일, 대장군 김유신과 김진주(金眞珠) · 김천존(金天存) 등과 함께 50,000명의 군사를 거느리고 서라벌을 출발하여 6월 18일에 남천정(南川停)에 이르렀고, 21일에 태자 김법민을 보내 병선(兵船) 100척을 거느리고 덕물도(德物島)에서 소정방을 맞아, 7월 10일에 백제의 사비성(泗沘城) 앞에서 합류하기로 약속을 정했다. 당군과 함께 백제를 공격할 5만 신라군의 지휘는 태자 김법민과 대장군 김유신, 장군 김품일(金品日)과 김흠춘(金欽春) 등이 맡고, 왕은 금돌성(今突城)에서 머물렀다.
7월 9일에 김유신 등이 이끄는 신라군이 황산벌에서 백제군을 격파하고, 당군도 백제군의 저지를 뚫고 기벌포로 상륙하여, 7월 13일에 사비성이 함락되었고, 7월 18일에는 웅진성으로 도망쳤던 의자왕도 항복하여 백제는 멸망하였다. 사비성을 함락했을 때 김법민은 백제의 왕자 부여융(扶餘隆)을 말 앞에 꿇어 앉히고 얼굴에 침을 뱉으며 “예전에 네놈의 아비가 내 누이를 억울하게 죽여 옥중에 묻었고 그 일 때문에 내가 20년 동안 마음 아프고 골치를 앓았었는데, 오늘 너의 목숨은 내 손 안에 있구나!”라고 꾸짖었다. 의자왕의 항복 소식을 듣고 29일에 금돌성에서 소부리성(所夫里城)으로 온 무열왕은 제감(弟監) 천복(天福)을 당에 보내 승리한 사실을 고하였다. 8월 2일에는 앞서 대야성이 백제에 함락될 때 신라측에서 내응했던 모척(毛尺)과 검일(黔日)을 잡아 처형하고, 주연(酒宴)을 베풀어 신라의 장병들을 위로하였다. 이때 의자왕과 그 아들 융(隆)을 마룻바닥에 앉혀 놓고 때로 의자왕에게 술을 따르게 하니, 백제의 여러 신하들 중 목메어 울지 않는 자가 없었다.
백제를 무너뜨린 뒤, 당군 사령관 소정방은 9월 3일에 낭장(郎將) 유인원(劉仁願)이 이끄는 10,000명을 사비성에 남아서 지키게 하고, 포로로 잡은 의자왕을 비롯한 백제의 왕족과 고위 신료, 12,000명의 백제 백성을 데리고 당으로 돌아갔다. 신라측 인사로 소정방과 동행한 것은 김인문과 사찬 김유돈(金儒敦), 대나마(大奈麻) 중지(中知) 등이었으며, 왕자 김인태(金仁泰)가 사찬(沙湌) 일원(日原) · 급찬(級湌) 길나(吉那) 등이 신라군 7천 명을 데리고 유인원을 도와 사비성을 수비했다. 당에서는 백제 땅에 웅진도독부를 비롯한 5도독부를 설치하고, 웅진도독으로 왕문도(王文度)를 파견하여 9월 28일에 삼년산성(三年山城)에서 무열왕을 만나 고종의 조서(詔書)를 전달하였는데, 예물을 주는 과정에서 왕문도는 급사(急死)하여 다른 사람이 대신 일을 마쳤다.

백제 부흥군 진압
이미 의자왕이 항복한 뒤부터 백제 땅에서는 부흥군들이 일어나 신라 · 당군과 전쟁을 벌였으며, 고구려도 11월 1일에 칠중성(七重城, 지금의 경기도 파주군 적성면)을 공격해 와서 군주 필부(匹夫)가 전사하기도 하였다. 백제 부흥군에 대한 공세에 나선 무열왕은 10월 9일에 태자 법민과 함께 여러 군사들을 인솔해 이례성(尒禮城)을 쳐서 18일에 함락시키고 인접한 백제의 20여 성의 항복을 받아냈으며, 30일에는 사비성 남쪽 산마루에 있던 백제 부흥군을 공격해 1,500명의 목을 베었다. 11월 5일에는 계탄(雞灘)을 건너 왕흥사잠성(王興寺岑城)을 공격해 7일째에 함락시키고 7백 명의 목을 베는 전과를 올리고 22일에 서라벌로 귀환해 논공행상을 벌였는데, 앞서 황산벌 전투에서 포로로 잡힌 좌평(佐平) 충상(忠常) · 상영(常英)에게 일길찬(一吉湌) 관등을 주어 총관(總管)직을 맡기는 등 포로로 잡거나 항복해온 백제의 관료들도 처벌하지 않고 관직을 내리기도 하였다.
백제를 멸망시킨 뒤 무열왕은 변경의 수자리 군사를 폐지하였다. 또한 압독주(押督州)를 옮겨 설치하고 도독을 임명하였다.

죽음
무열왕 8년(661년) 음력 6월 59세로 사망하였다. 시호(諡號)를 무열(武烈)이라 하고, 영경사(永敬寺)의 북쪽에 장사를 지냈으며, 묘호(廟號)를 올려서 태종(太宗)이라고 하였다. 당 고종은 무열왕이 죽었다는 소식을 듣고 낙성문(洛城門)에서 애도식을 거행하였다.

인물
한국과 중국, 일본을 누빈 외교가로서, 《일본서기》에는 고토쿠 천황 3년인 다이카 3년(647년)에 사신으로 왔던 김춘추에 대해 “용모가 아름답고 쾌활하게 담소하였다(美姿顔善談笑)”고 평한 기록이 남아 있으며, 《삼국유사》에도 무열왕이 병사를 청하러 당에 들어갔을 때, 당의 황제(태종)가 무열왕의 풍채를 보고 칭찬하여 ""신성한 사람(神聖之人)""이라 부르며 그를 붙잡아두어 시위(侍衛)로 삼으려 했지만 극구 청하여 돌아왔다는 이야기를 전하고 있다. 삼국사기에서는 무열왕의 용모가 영특하고 뛰어나 어려서부터 세상을 다스릴 뜻이 있었다고 기록했다.
굉장한 대식가로, 《삼국유사》에는 한 끼 식사로 쌀 서 말과 꿩 아홉 마리를 먹었으며, 백제를 멸망시킨 경신년(660년) 이후로 점심은 먹지 않고 아침과 저녁만 먹게 되었는데, 그러고도 하루에 먹는 양은 쌀 여섯 말에 술 여섯 말, 꿩 열 마리였다고 한다.

무덤
《삼국사기》는 태종 무열왕의 무덤이 영경사(永敬寺) 북쪽에 있다고 기록하였으며, 지금의 경주시 서악동 842번지의 선도산 동쪽 구릉에 소재한 서악리 고분군의 다섯 고분 가운데 가장 아래에 위치한 원형봉토분이 태종 무열왕의 능으로 비정되고 있다. 봉분의 면적은 14,169m2로, 신라의 왕릉 가운데 피장자를 확실하게 알 수 있는 몇 안 되는 무덤으로서 가치가 있으며 1963년 1월 21일에 대한민국 사적 제20호로 지정되었고, 1972년부터 1973년에 걸쳐 주변 정비가 이루어졌다. 굴식 돌방무덤(횡혈식 석실분)으로 추정되는 이 무덤은 다른 왕릉에 비해 봉분 장식이 소박한 편으로 무덤 주위에 자연석으로 둘레돌을 돌렸다.
무덤 앞 동북쪽에는 『태종무열왕릉비』(국보 제25호)가 있는데, 일제 강점기 이전에 이미 비석의 몸돌 부분은 사라지고 귀부와 이수 부분만 남아있었으며, 이수에 '태종무열대왕지비(太宗武烈大王之碑)'라는 여덟 글자가 새겨져 있어 묘의 주인이 무열왕임을 확실히 규명할 수 있다. 《대동금석서》(大東金石書)에 의하면 비는 무열왕이 사망한 661년에 건립되었고, 비문의 글씨는 무열왕의 아들인 김인문이 썼다.

화랑세기의 기록
필사본 《화랑세기》에는 태종 무열왕의 생애와 몇가지 사실에 대해서 통설과 전혀 다른 사실을 전하고 있다.

《삼국사기》를 비롯한 전통적인 사료의 기록 및 해석에서 김춘추의 아버지 용춘의 다른 이름이 용수인 것으로 알려져 있으나, 필사본 《화랑세기》는 용춘과 용수는 서로 다른 인물이자 진지왕을 아버지로 둔 형제이며, 동생인 용춘이 천명공주와 혼인하여 춘추를 낳았으나 용춘이 먼저 사망하자 다시 용수와 재혼하여 춘추는 용수의 양자로 들어가게 되었다고 나온다. 다만 『황룡사중수기』에는 용춘이 《화랑세기》의 기록과 달리 후대에도 생존해 있는 상태로 기록되어 있으며, 이는 《화랑세기》 위서론의 중요한 근거 가운데 하나이다(화랑세기#용수 문제 참조).
젊은 시절 제18대 풍월주를 역임하였다고 한다.
필사본 《화랑세기》에서는 12대 풍월주 보리공(菩利公)의 딸 보룡(寶龍)과의 사이에서 아들 당원전군(幢元殿君)과 딸 여씨(呂氏)를 두었고, 문명왕후와의 사이에서도 선원전군(仙元殿君)이라는 아들이 더 있었다고 설명한다. 또한 무열왕은 문희와 혼인하기 이전에 이미 보종과 양명공주의 딸 보라궁주(寶羅宮主) 설씨와 결혼했으며, 처음 문희는 측실로 혼인하였으나 보라궁주의 요절로 문희가 정실이 될 수 있었다고 한다. 또한 문희의 언니인 보희와의 사이에도 지원(知元)이라는 왕자가 있었다고 적고 있는데, 이들 왕자의 실존은 아직 확실하게 밝혀지지 않았다.

태종 무열왕에 대한 당대 신라인들의 평가는 매우 높았다. 이는 ‘태종(太宗)’이라는 묘호를 올린 것에서도 알 수 있는데, 이는 삼국 역사상 최초이자 신라에서 재위한 임금 중에는 열조 원성왕과 함께 유이한 사례였다. 이에 대해 당 고종이 “당 태종이 위징(魏徵)·이순풍(李淳風) 등을 얻어 천하를 평정하는 대업을 이루었기에 태종이라 하였지만, 너희 신라는 바다 밖에 있는 조그만 나라임에도 태종의 호를 사용하여 천자의 칭호를 참칭하니 그 뜻이 불충하므로” 이를 고칠 것을 요구하자, 신라의 신문왕(神文王)은 “(당 태종처럼) 무열왕도 김유신이라는 성신(聖臣)을 얻어서 삼한을 통일하는 대업을 이루었다”며 완곡하게 거절하는 답서를 보냈다. 이 답서를 받은 고종은 그가 태자로 있을 때 하늘에서 이르기를 “33천(天)의 한 사람이 신라에 내려가 유신이 되었다.”고 한 일이 있어서 이를 기록한 바가 있는데, 이 기록을 찾아 확인해보고서는 놀랍고 두려워서, 태종의 묘호를 허락했다고 한다. 훗날 조선(朝鮮)의 성리학자 김종직(金宗直)은 《동국여지승람》에 기록된 고려(高麗)의 태조(太祖) 이래 역대 군주들의 묘호를 시호로 대체하고자 하는 성종(成宗)에게 태종 무열왕의 선례를 들며 굳이 기록된 묘호를 뺄 필요는 없음을 주장하였다.
성덕왕(聖德王)은 태종 무열왕의 명복을 빌고자 봉덕사(奉德寺)를 지었으며, 혜공왕(惠恭王)은 오묘(五廟)를 정하면서 김씨로서 처음으로 왕이 된 미추왕(味鄒王)과 더불어, 백제와 고구려를 평정한 태종 무열왕과 문무왕을 대대로 헐지 않는 신주(世世不毁之宗)로 삼았고, 이것은 애장왕 2년(801년) 태종 무열왕과 문무왕만 따로 떼어 모시는 사당을 지어 신주를 옮길 때까지 계속되었다. 9세기 중엽 신라의 문장가였던 최치원(崔致遠)은 『낭혜화상백월보광탑비(聖住寺郞慧和尙白月普光塔碑)』(890년경 건립)에서 무열왕의 8세 손으로 당에 유학하여 불법을 배우고 돌아온 승려 낭혜화상의 행적과 무열왕의 업적을 교차대비시켜 ""이때(태종 무열왕의 입당 후 귀국)부터 우리는 한 번 변하여 노나라가 되었다(自玆吾土一變至於魯)"", ""두 적국(敵國)을 평정하고 문명에 접하게 하여 주셨다(平二敵國俾人變外飭)""고 하여 태종 무열왕이 신라 국내의 제도를 당풍으로 개편하여 '문명화'시키고, 당시 신라뿐 아니라 중국에게도 적국으로 여겨지던 고구려와 백제를 평정하여 평화를 가져왔다고 찬양하였으며, 또한 진성여왕 7년(893년)에 당의 태사시중에게 보내는 글에서 옛날 고구려와 백제의 강성함과 당 태종의 고구려 침공, 그 직후 무열왕이 당으로 들어가 수교를 맺고 원병을 청하여 백제와 고구려를 멸망시킨 것과 이후 고구려의 유민들에 의해 세워진 발해와 당, 신라의 충돌 등의 사실들을 열거하면서 ""3백여 년 동안 한쪽 지방은 무사하고 넓은 바다가 편안한 것은 곧 우리 무열대왕의 공로""라고까지 평가하였다. 고려나 조선의 유학자들도 대부분 이와 비슷한 인식이었다.

부정론
그러나 20세기 초, 한국이 일본에 의해 강제 병합되고 식민지배하에 놓이면서, 기존의 한국 역사에 대한 비판과 함께 태종 무열왕은 외세를 끌어들어 민족사적 강역을 축소시켰다는 비판을 받게 되었다. 을사늑약을 비판하여 시일야방성대곡이라는 논설을 기고하기도 했던 장지연은 김춘추가 당병을 이끌어 동족(백제와 고구려)을 친 이 사건으로 인하여 한국 역사는 천여 년을 외국의 사상에 이끌려 다니며 자국의 위풍을 멸하고 타인의 위세가 늘어나게 되었다고 비판하였고 이것이 한국이 하나로 뭉치지 못한 요인의 하나라고 주장하였다.
신채호는 민족주의적 견지에서 고구려와 백제, 신라를 다 똑같이 '신성한 부여족', 즉 '조선 한민족의 형제'라 부르며, 당과 손을 잡고 고구려와 백제를 친 김춘추(태종 무열왕)의 행동을 “도적을 끌어들여 형제를 죽인” 격으로, “다른 민족을 끌어들여 동족인 고구려, 백제를 없앤 역사의 죄인”이라는 혹독한 비판을 가했다. 특히 신채호는 《독사신론》에서 4천 년간의 민족사는 부여족 소장성쇠(消長盛衰)의 역사라 하여 부여족이 주족이라는 인식하에 긍정적으로 평가되던 ‘삼국통일’의 대업에 대한 역사적 의의를 비판해 김유신(金庾信)·김춘추(金春秋) 및 김부식(金富軾)의 공죄(功罪)를 논하였다. 이것은 한국의 고대사를 반도 중심으로 보았던 종래의 역사 인식 체계를 만주 중심과 단군, 부여족 중심으로 보았기 때문이다.
남북국 시대론을 지지하였으며 《조선상고사감》을 저술하기도 했던 안재홍도 신라가 당을 끌어들여 백제와 고구려를 멸한 것은 평양이나 관북 일대를 비롯한 대부분의 북방 영토를 방기한 데다 당의 명령을 빌어 외세의 힘을 이용한 신라의 행동에서 후세 역사에 등장한 소위 '사대주의'의 대부분이 여기서 비롯되었다고 평하였다.
해방 후에도 이러한 인식은 고스란히 이어졌다. 한국 민속학의 원조이기도 한 손진태는 김유신이나 김춘추의 능력을 높이 평가하면서도 ""동족을 공격하기 위해서 이민족과 연맹하는 것은 민족적으로 최대의 죄악""이며, 신라가 당과 손잡은 것을 ""귀족 국가의 비민족적 본질""이라 비난하였고, 한국역사연구회에서 편찬한 <한국역사>(1992)는 '통일'이라는 용어를 쓰면서도 그 통일의 '불완전함'과 '남북국 시대'라는 그 다음 시대의 성격을 강조했다.
1993년 성균관대학교의 김영하 교수는 천리장성의 예를 들어 축소된 강역으로 만주의 요동땅을 밟지못하고 고토를 잃고 살다가 조선에 와서야 겨우 압록강과 두만강 그리고 백두산만을 찾을 수 있었다고 평가를 내놓으면서 당의 한반도 경략에 발맞추어 외세와의 공조로 백제만을 겨우 정복한 신라는 ""통일을 완수할 힘도 의도도 전혀 없었다""고 단정하고 '통일신라 시대' 대신에 '신라와 발해' 내지는 '남북국 시대'라는 용어를 사용할 것을 적극 주장했다.

도식주의적 대립에 대한 비판론
신라의 '삼한통일', 나아가 그것에 처음 불을 당긴 김춘추의 대당 사대 외교에 대한 비판에서 주된 쟁점이 되는 것은, 과연 김춘추가 활동할 당시 혹은 그 이전에 신라, 고구려, 백제 삼국 사이에 서로를 '동족'으로 인식하는 관념이 존재했느냐 하는 것이다.
《구당서》 등에서 신라, 고구려, 백제 삼국이 서로 말과 풍속이 같았다고 서술하고 있는 것으로 보아, 서로를 '동류'로 파악하는 의식이 있었을 거라는 점은 짐작할 수 있다. 그러나, 부여 계열인 고구려, 백제와 삼한(三韓) 중 진한 및 변한(가야) 계열인 신라는 시조 신화나 제사, 정치 체계 및 혼인풍속 등에서 여러 차이가 있었고, 특히 수백년에 걸쳐 계속된 치열한 경쟁 속에서 특화된 이질성과 오랜 전쟁으로 인한 적대감이 상당히 누적되어 있었다. 4세기 백제의 팽창에 대응하기 위해 신라는 당시 백제와 대립하고 있던 고구려와 연대했지만, 고구려의 전성기였던 5세기 후반에는 다시 백제와 나제동맹을 맺어 고구려를 공동의 적으로 삼고 서로 가까워졌다. 그러나 나제동맹 역시 552년 한강 유역을 둘러싼 갈등으로 파탄났으며, 554년 백제의 성왕이 신라의 매복에 걸려 전사하면서 돌이킬 수 없는 지경에 이르렀다.
642년 김춘추와 연개소문 사이의 교섭은, 신라에게 죽령 이북의 한강 유역 전체를 내놓고 현재의 영남 지역에 국한된 약소국으로 남기를 요구하는 고구려의 제국주의적 태도와 한강 유역을 잃으면 패망을 면할 수 없다는 신라 지배자들의 인식이 타협의 여지 없이 상충되어 결렬될 수 밖에 없었다. 이러한 당시의 현실에서 당나라와 연합해 고구려와 백제를 멸망시킨 김춘추의 선택은 그가 현대 한국인이 아닌 고대 신라인, 그것도 신라의 지배자였다는 점을 냉정하게 인식하는 바탕 위에서 평가되어야 한다.
사방의 적에 둘러싸여 궁지에 몰리자 당 태종의 고구려 정벌 정책에 편승해 백제와 고구려를 멸망시킨 전쟁의 결과로 당시 신라인들은 수백년간 지속된 전쟁 상태의 종식, 백제 영토의 흡수, 중국 신문물의 수입에 의한 중화식 개혁 등 신라의 국가적 과업을 달성할 수 있었다. 또한, 고구려 영토 역시 근·현대의 민족주의적 관점과 같은 인식이 없었던 고대의 신라 지배층에게 있어서는 땅을 상실하기는커녕 대동강 이남 지역(현재의 황해도)을 신라가 획득함으로써 영토를 확장하는 성과를 낸 것이었고, 당대 최강 국가인 당나라를 상대로 한 최선의 결과물이었다. 다만, 이러한 냉정한 평가는 김춘추가 한민족사의 영웅이라기보다 중요 인물 중 하나가 될 수 밖에 없는 본질과 한계를 재확인시켜 준다.
백제의 영토를 흡수하고 한반도의 중남부 지역을 차지하게 된 신라는 후대의 한반도 통일국가인 고려, 조선의 모태가 되었기 때문에 7세기 말에 신라인들이 사용했던 '삼한일통'이나 '삼국통일'과 같은 말은 19세기까지 별 거부감 없이 받아들여져 계속 쓰였다.

이름
양주동의 연구에 의하면, ‘朴赫居世’의 ‘赫’과 ‘朴’은 둘다 ‘ᄇᆞᆰ’(밝다)의 뜻을 반복하여 쓴 것이다.

생애
삼국유사가 전하는 설화에 따르면, 혁거세는 사로국 6부 촌장들이 임금을 세우는 회의를 하던 중 하늘에서 내려온 백마가 낳은 알에서 출생했다. 즉, 기원전 69년 여섯 마을의 촌장들이 각기 자기 자녀들과 함께 알천 언덕에 모여 “우리들에게는 우리들 모두를 다스려 줄 임금이 없어 모두가 안일하여 각자 자기가 하고 싶은 대로 행동하는 바람에 도무지 질서가 없다. 그러하니 덕이 있는 사람을 찾아내어 그를 임금으로 모시고 나라를 만들자.”라고 의논하였다. 그런데 그 때, 회의 장소인 알천 언덕에서 남쪽으로 그다지 멀지 않은 양산(楊山)이라는 산기슭에 번갯불 같은 이상한 기운이 보였다. 촌장들은 더 잘 보기 위해 좀 더 높은 곳으로 올라갔는데, 양산 기슭에 있는 나정(蘿井)이라는 우물 곁에서 번갯불이 솟아오르고 있었고, 그 옆에는 하얀 말 한 마리가 절하는 것처럼 한참 꿇어 엎드려 있다가 길게 소리쳐 울고는 하늘로 날아올라가 버렸다. 말이 떠나자 촌장들은 그 말이 누었던 장소로 일제히 몰려가 봤더니 그 곳에는 자줏빛의 큰 알이 하나 놓여 있었다. 촌장들이 그 알을 보고 있으니 갑자기 깨져버렸다. 그 안에 생김새가 몹시 단정하고 아름다운 한 사내아이가 있었다. 모두들 놀라고 신기해 하며, 아기를 동천(東泉)이라는 샘에 데리고 가서 몸을 씻겼다. 그러자 아기의 몸에서 광채가 나고, 짐승들이 몰려와 덩달아 노래를 부르며 춤을 추었고, 하늘과 땅이 울렁이며 태양과 달의 빛이 더욱 밝아졌다. 촌장들은 그 아이의 알이 매우 커서 박과 같다고 하여 성을 박(朴)으로 지었고 이름을 혁거세(赫(爀)居世)라고 지었다.
일연은 사소부인에게서 출생했다는 설도 기록하였다. 여기서 서술성모는 선도성모와 같은 여신이다. 사소부인의 출신지는 정확하게 전하지는 않으나 그녀가 정착하였다는 형산이란 서형산(西兄山), 선도산(仙桃山)이라고도 부르는 산으로, 천자의 딸인 혁거세 거서간 어머니가 떠나 정착하였다 한다. 일연은 천자의 나라를 자신이 살던 시대를 잘못 적용해 중국이라 착각했다.
혁거세의 부친과 관련된 기록은 전하지 않는다.
촌장들은 남산의 서쪽 기슭(지금의 창림사(昌林寺)를 지칭)에 궁궐을 짓고 신성한 두 아이를 받들어 길렀다. 사내 아이가 알에서 나왔는데 그 알이 박처럼 생겼다. 그래서 사람들이 박을 박(朴)이라 하였기 때문에 성을 박(朴)이라 하였다. 여자 아이는 그 아이가 나온 우물의 이름을 따서 이름(나정)을 지었다. 두 성인이 나이 13세가 되자 오봉(五鳳) 원년 갑자(기원전 57)에 남자는 즉위하여 왕이 되었고 이어 여자를 왕후로 삼았다. 나라 이름을 서라벌(徐羅伐) 또는 서벌(徐伐)(지금 풍속에 ‘경(京)’을 ‘서벌’이라고 하는 것은 이 때문)이라 하는데, 혹은 사라(斯羅) 또는 사로(斯盧)라고도 한다. 처음에 왕후가 계정(雞井)에서 태어났기 때문에 계림국(雞林國)이라고도 하였는데, 계룡이 상서로움을 나타냈기 때문이다. 하지만 다른 일설에 따르면, 탈해 이사금 때 김알지(金閼智)를 얻을 당시에 숲속에서 닭이 울었으므로 나라 이름을 고쳐 계림이라 하였다고도 한다. 후세에 와서 드디어 신라(新羅)라고 정하였다. 
기원전 53년(재위 5년) 1월 알영부인이 태어났다. 기원전 50년 왜인이 변경을 침략했으나, 혁거세가 신령한 덕이 있다는 말을 듣고 되돌아갔다. 기원전 41년(재위 17년) 6부를 두루 돌면서 위무하였는데, 왕비 알영부인이 따라 갔다. 농사와 양잠(누에치기)에 힘쓰도록 권하고 독려하여 땅이 주는 이로움을 다 얻도록 하였다. 기원전 39년(재위 19년) 봄 정월에 변한(卞韓)이 나라를 바쳐 항복해 왔다는 기록이 있으나, 신채호는 이를 신뢰하지 않았다. 
기원전 37년(재위 21년) 수도 금성에 성을 쌓았고, 기원전 32년(즉위 26년)에 금성에 궁실을 지으니 이때 나라의 기틀이 잡혔다. 기원전 28년 낙랑이 침범하였으나, 사람들이 밤에 문을 걸어 잠그지 않고 곡식도 한데에 쌓아 들판에 널린 것을 보고서 도덕의 나라라 하여 스스로 물러갔다. 기원전 20년(재위 38년) 봄 음력 2월 마한에 사신 호공(瓠公)을 보냈는데, 조공을 바치지 않는 것을 탓하는 마한 왕에게 호공이 그럴 필요가 없다 하자, 마한 왕이 분노하여 그를 죽이려 했으나 신하들의 만류로 놓아주었다. 그리고 이듬해 마한 왕이 죽어 신하들이 마한을 정벌할 것을 권하나 혁거세는 “다른 사람의 불행을 요행으로 여기는 것은 어질지 못한 일이다.” 하여 사신을 보내 조문하였다. 이는 그 무렵 신라의 정치 체제가 바로잡혀 마한에 매여있지 않게 되어있다는 것을 말한다. 기원전 5년(재위 53년)에 동옥저(東沃沮)의 사신이 와 말 20필을 바쳤다는 기록이 있으나, 신채호는 이를 신뢰하지 않았다. 기원후 3년(재위 60년) 가을 9월 용 두 마리가 금성(金城)의 우물 안에서 나타났다. 갑작스럽게 천둥이 치면서 비가 쏟아졌다. 성의 남쪽 문에 벼락이 쳤다.
설화에 따르면 혁거세 거서간은 재위 62년 만에 하늘로 승천하였다가 7일 만에 시신이 부위별로 나뉘어 흩어져서 지상으로 떨어졌다고 전한다. 백성들이 혁거세 거서간의 나뉜 몸을 다시 하나로 모아 장사를 지내려고 하였으나 커다란 뱀 한 마리가 나타나 사람들을 쫓아내며 훼방을 놓았다. 백성들은 할 수 없이 양다리와 양팔과 몸통과 얼굴을 따로 묻어 혁거세 거서간의 무덤은 5개가 되었고 혁거세 거서간의 무덤들을 오릉(五陵)이라고 부르게 되었다. 뱀 때문에 혁거세 거서간의 나뉜 몸을 따로 묻어서 사릉(巳陵)이라고도 한다. 오릉(五陵)은 담암사(曇巖寺) 북쪽에 있다.

박씨 족보와의 차이
신라 박씨 족보는 혁거세 거서간의 장남 박특(朴忒)을 신라 개국공신으로 기록 하고 있어 혁거세 거서간의 출생이 사료의 기록(기원전 69년)보다 이를 것이라 추측할 수 있는 근거를 제공하고 있다. 하지만 현존하는 각종 박씨 관련 보학 자료들이 조선 중기 또는 후기 이전에 소급되지 않는다는 사실을 고려할 때 일단은 12세기에 편찬된 《삼국사기》와 13세기 편찬된 《삼국유사》의 내용을 정설로 보고 있다.
